# HotelInspectionPredictionSystem
Analyzed Trip Advisor’s dataset based on the customer’s review and ratings in order to predict the hotels that have a higher possibility of inspection using Hadoop, MapReduce, Mahout, MongoDB.

The data from the travel company contains reviews and ratings for a large number of hotels all over the world. This data is analysed to prioritize the hotels for inspection. The process is broken down as follows:
    
  1. Compose a list of features of the hotels which are to be extracted from the user reviews. 
    
  2. Extract the features and determine what the customer’s opinion is towards each feature by using opinion mining/sentiment analysis techniques. 
  
  3. Use the feature score and rating given by each customer for each hotel and isolate hotels which have poor review scores.
    
  4. Provide an effective data visualization on the front end for the client to immediately obtain the information they need at first glance.

Technologies: Hadoop, Mahout, Hive, MongoDB, D3.js
