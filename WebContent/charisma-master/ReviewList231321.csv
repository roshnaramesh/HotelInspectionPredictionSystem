UR124037938,2012-2-February,This hotel is not three stars! First room i was given had no windows and two large boxes covering holes which led outside with freezing cold air. I was moved to another room but this was rundown bathroom was no bigger that a shoebox. Avoid this hotel.,Davelad2012
UR121527895,2011-8-December,I read the reviews of this hotel before we travelled but tried to keep an open mind! First and foremost the hotel's best feature is it's location! This was the reason we booked it and the hotel could not be better situated or easier to find. We arrived from the airport by train and it was just a couple of minutes walk from the station and centrally located for everything else. The staff were friendly and helpful and as mentioned in previous reviews we did have to pay a 25 deposit when we checked in. I found it strange that we were asked to hand in our room key to reception every time we left the hotel and had to ask for it back on our return. But it didn't cause any problems. Our double room (107 on the first floor) was shabby looking and dated as I had expected from reading the reviews. That didn't worry me too much though. The room was a generous size and was at the front of the hotel directly above the main entrance. There was a lot of street noise......if you were a light sleeper you'd maybe want to ask for a quieter room but I'm not and we enjoyed being able to see what was going on in the busy street outside. The TV had a good choice of English language channels and the free Wi-Fi (which is only supposed to work in the public areas) worked in our room too so that was a plus. The bathroom was clean and functional and the shower was hot and extremely powerful - but the shower head was hung far to high on the wall for most people! Luckily my husband is 6'5" and could get it down for me - I could never have reached it myself! Towels were changed daily and shower gel handwash and hairdryer are provided in the bathroom too. Breakfast was basic. There wasn't much choice but what there was was sufficient to fill you up for the morning and staff were constantly replenishing the food so nothing ever ran out even when we were among the last ones in for breakfast. Now.........the mice!! We didn't take food in our room but they still came looking for it! I'm not particularly squeamish about things like that and didn't think the odd mouse would bother me. But it wasn't just the odd one.......you could hear them scratching about in the room all night long and I have to admit even I was a bit freaked out by it! Would I stay here again? If it wasn't for the mice yes. If you're lucky enough to get a room without any this is a friendly well priced hotel for the location. But the mice were a step too far for me!,Suzanne H
UR116417905,2011-8-August,The room was dirty when we arrived. The cleaned it after we complained. Furthermore we forgot two jacket (our mistake) but I called the reception the same afternoon but the jackets was gone. No one other than the cleaning staff was in the room...... The leason learned. Dont forget anything when you leave the hotel,Jimmy_copenhagen
UR95062117,2011-31-January,I stayed at the hotel as recommended on the Easyjet website. The room was filthy the common areas shabby staff were rude and unhelpful and breakfast poor. This is not an experience that I would wish to repeat.,keithhart1948

UR119778301,2011-27-October,what a hotel run-down tiny room window opened into a concrete court yard where people smoked and talked into the early morning so unable to open the window for fresh air with out smoke wafting into the room and the noise keeping you awake all night breakfast in the morning was the worst i have ever had coffee was like dont know hard to explain and food well we went out for breakfast after that left out luggage in the luggage room on the last day and yes they lost the key so had to wait until a replacement found stressful when you have a flight to catch would not recommended this hotel to anyone if your thinking about it LOOK FOR ANOTHER HOTEL,John N
UR121085088,2011-27-November,Location location location must be the key to the pricing here because I couldn't see how this hotel can justify charging 60 Euros a night for a single room that wasn't any better than any of the hostels you can find dotted around Amsterdam. I was most aggrieved at check in when I was informed the credit/debit card machine had broken and if I wanted to continue the reservation I'd have to pay cash. After carefully planning how much cash I'd needed to bring with me (and hence getting best exchange rates and paying minimum commission) I was a bit cheesed off that I'd now have to withdraw cash from a foreign ATM and be hit with charges I hadn't planned for. No great problem I know but it was their manner that really grated me. Once through reception it becomes clear that they don't reinvest much in this hotel. The carpets were torn and dirty stairs wonky rooms patchy and no curtain. Someone's obviously making a lot of money out of this place. But it's saving grace is that it is located half way up Damrak - 5 minutes from Centraal Station 5 minutes from Dam Square 5 minutes from the Red Light District shopping precinct right behind. Okay if all you're after is somewhere to put your head down for the night and you're not exactly after the Ritz but come on Delta - be a bit more realistic with your pricing.,Hungry_Hippo_UK
UR101726100,2011-27-March,Very disappointed as I had previously emailed the hotel to inform them of my disability as in steps are difficult for me. They allocated me a room on 3rd floor down 3 steep steps. Health and safety issue if there had been a fire when unable to use a lift. A party of young males were checking in before me and 2 of them were allocated a triple room with balcony on the first floor. I feel my request for a room without stair access was ignored. My request for a room change was refused and a subsequent email sent to the management whilst I was there received no response. This is not good customer care. I feel the girl who dealt with me on reception and allocated the rooms was not bothered. There is also an issue about the advertised wifi throughout the hotel. This is NOT the case. The staff roll out the excuse that they cannot deal with the wifi but it is accessible in the restaurant. This excuse seemed well practised. Another American guest in a first floor room told me he had been told the same and he could not access the "wifi" from the first floor either. However the restaurant staff were very pleasant and helpful. The housekeeping too was fine as the room was well looked after and I have no complaints at all re that. It was an interior room with a window looking out 1 metre to another wall. Without much natural light it wasn't the best room to allocate to a disabled person who would spend time there resting in between trying to see the city. The position of the hotel is what sells it to visitors I suspect and consequently the management does not have to try too hard. I think there is a great deal of difference between the room quality and one has to play pot luck as to which room one is allocated (with the young blond receptionist it might be more favourable to be a young male for example) Can highly recommend Der Klos for dining.... Kerkstraat 41 in between the flower market and leidsplein. This was a return visit and is the best place I have ever eaten ribs! Good idea to purchase the bus and entrance ticket to the Keukenhof. 21 = a good deal Bus goes from,remfan
UR109919383,2011-26-May,If you just want a bed four walls a TV and a shower near the red light district - and you're not fussy about cleanliness - this might meet your minimum expectations. But for most people this hotel will feel like really roughing it. I paid >$200 to stay one night in an eight person room ( unfortunately the only available room in Amsterdam that night). Positive points - Friendly receptionist. Convenient location for Amsterdam Centraal station and seedy areas of downtown - if that's what you want (red light district and coffee shops). I would say this is an OK flop house for a group of frat house types who just want to be close to the red light district and coffee shops. Sharing a room between eight will minimize costs - as long as you don't care about any degree of amenities and you're not fussy about cleanliness.. The shower was good albeit a little scary - scalding water at ENORMOUS pressure. I stood outside the shower area to adjust the temperature and once I got it to a comfortable temperature I have to say it was an invigorating way to start the day. Negative points - A grimy room. Most fittings in the room were in a state of disrepair. Lighting was rudimentary - a ceiling light at the entrance of the room and a bare bulb on one wall. There were two table lamps with no bulbs in them. Impossible to work in the room because the lack of working electric power outlets made it impossible to plug in a PC and have a light on at the same time. There is no WiFi working in the room. The bed sheets appeared to be fresh but very threadbare (holes in a few places). Curtains and net curtains were blackened after exposure over years to fumes from the street I guess. The wooden floor appeared to have been swept but I found plastic cups and litlte bits of trash that had been left behind by previous occupants . Location is rowdy and noisy until the early hours of the morning - not suitable if you want a good night's rest. There's no soap shampoo etc. The hotel provides a few scratchy threadbare towels. Restaurant - The restaurant downstairs serves an adequate free breakfast - some low grade bread some cereal a tray of soggy bacon and a tray of dried out scrambled egg. Don't go there for an evening meal. The service is odd - not allowing single travelers to take a large table even though the place is 75% empty and not offering "lunch" items like omelete in the evening. (I don't want to eat a steak just before going to bed thank you... ). Amazingly the kitchen managed to botch an order of spaghetti and salad - Ridiculously overcooked pasta and a watered down sauce from a tin I think. Awful. But I guess food is not Amsterdam's strong point in general.,jib71
UR121034362,2011-25-November,this is the worst hotel me and my friends had ever stayed in the was 10 of us had an 8 man room and a 2 man room. the beds were not cleaned proply they only flip the sheets and give you new towels there was damp on the wall and to top it off the room had MICE we found mouse traps and mouse POSION and they dont want you take take food in the room the only hotel iv ever known to be like that and if you do you will lose your deposit but now we know why. the mice had eaten threw a pack of my mates chrips/chips. will never use this hotel again and i go twice a year. for 95euros a night you should not have mice in your room DO NOT USE whatever the price or deal worst hotel EVER.,terry p
UR120998593,2011-24-November,The Delta is situated in a very central position which is always a good thing when staying in a city. I had read some of the reviews which were poor but only stayed in this hotel because we were meeting friends who had already booked. Our room had grubby carpets and net curtains and the curtains that were coming off the rails. However the bed linen was clean and the bed comfortable. We stayed at the back of the hotel which was over the kitchens but it was quiet and the bathroom was clean. The staff on the desk were friendly but the hotel is tatty and well past it's sell-by date it reminded me of student accomodation so at around 95 euros a night it seemed expensive. The seats in reception were very stained and breakfast was the poorest I'd ever had in a hotel before. Ever!,fluffbury
UR114476956,2011-20-June,This hotel is ABSOLUTELY DREADFUL I dont know how it gets a three star rating it should be three scull and cross bones with a hazzard warning on the door. The room are filthy and non of the appliances work ie. bed lamp shower sink etc. Breafast is also a disaster not enough food to go round and cold coffee. But worst of all when all other hotels are very busy this place doubles its prices! As for the location it is very central but in a horible area. *******DO NOT STAY HERE*******you have been warned,willhove
UR111185539,2011-2-June,We Booked this place on: October 2 2010 Booking ID: 9608984870 our check in May 13 at 10:00pm price 396 EUROS (NOT A CHEAP PLACE FOR WHAT IT IS) We went out for dinner with friends and came back at 2:00am at 4:00am I woke up with a horrible rush turned lights on and there were bugs all over the place. My neck Forehead and Arm were bitten and swollen immediately went down to the front desk and the guy working there seemed to be embarrssed he said that the person in charge came at 8:00am and there were no rooms available so we could not change our room and could not give us our money back so we decided not to go back to the room my wife was terrified and sat at a chair until 10:00am when finally this lady in charge showed up. She was rude and refused to give us our money back until I threatened to go to the police and show them the video and pictures of the bugs walking all over the sheets mattress and carpet. then in a bad manner she took the phone called someone and gave us our money. after all we were happy to leave this place and stayed at the Sheraton Schiphol and slept all day at their beautiful sweet sleeper beds with no bugs.,alexstar8a
UR119469553,2011-19-October,Yes the title is correct - there was a mouse in my room and a shower that overflowed everyday into the bedroom and on one occassion leaked into the bedroom below mine. On a daily basis during my stay I informed reception that the shower was overflowing and I was told each time that it had been fixed only to find it overflowing again the next time the shower was used. As if this stay was not bad enough a mouse ran across the bedroom floor causing me to complain to reception. The response I got was "just one question - did you have food in your room?" I was outraged by this as I had not had food in my room but had witnessed each day during our stay the cleaning staff having their breakfast/lunch in the cleaning storgae room just a few doors down from our room. This hotel refused to move me to another room and advised me that I was entitled to a refund due to the endless issues that I'd experienced. This was just the start of a bad customer service journey...... Even though I'd paid for the stay in cash the hotel demanded bank details to allow them to transfer the money directly into my account with I provided. Two weeks after my stay the refund that still not been tranferred into my account. I contact the hotel by email and then had to telephone to get an answer about the refund. I was then told by the hotel to provide them with my credit card number for the refund to provided and yet again I provided them with my details and guess what.... three days later the refund had still not been placed on my credit card causing me to telephone the hotel once again. This time they informed me that they would transfer the money today - refunding one nights stay! I had stayed for three nights in this hotel and was expecting a full refund after such a terrible stay. . Each day that passed during my stay went from bad to worse and I've never left a hotel review before but felt I had to inform others about my experience and hope that someone knows who to contact to make sure that this hotel is investigated. This hotel is the worst hotel i've ever had the misfortune to stay at!,UnhappyCustomer527
UR100261386,2011-15-March,this has got to be one of the worst hotels i have ever stayed at and i have stayed in some poor hotels- they advertise "family rooms" but what they really mean is rooms to fit a group of men out for a party weekend. the rooms were unclean with cigarette ends on the floor the furniture was damaged and well worn and the carpets were disgusting. i spent around 15 minutes there then left and found another hotel.i would not let my wife and kids stay there or anybody elses wife or kids for that matter. the street is noisy with rooms above a chip shop and on a very busy street.,tonycrane
UR107681973,2011-10-May,$200 per night for a room. Caked on mould in the bathroom. No eating allowed in your room. No air conditioning. Not being able to open your windows because your rooms above a tram line...priceless! TRAVELLERS BEWARE!!! Sleep on the streets if you have to!,Boyds_TSB
UR116535732,2011-10-August,Great location and good view from room but that was all I am afraid. The room was very basic and in need of refurbishment. There was a step into the bathroom which was dangerous and we tripped over it several times. The room was infested with fleas and bedbugs we got several bites during our stay. Guests are promised 15% off food puchased in the restaurant for lunch and dinner but this was not reimbursed despite our complaints. Noisy partygoers allowed to congregate outside hotel in early hours and not moved on by hotel staff despite guests being told to be quiet after 22.00hours.,Gina W
UR57853642,2010-6-March,Paid average enough price for city centre - not too cheap but an absolute rip off! Rooms stank were really old fashioned shower sprang from boiling to freezing no bath not even a bath matt so bathroom flooded after wach shower.. Needed to request clean towels daily.. Have never been in a "hotel" soooo bad! Hostel it should be!!,sandraaw
UR91082201,2010-30-December,I would NEVER recommend anyone to stay at the Delta Hotel... during the night you hear rats in your room ratling around in your bags. The shower room/toilet was discusting.. the shower curtain was liturally touching the toilet. My advise would be to avoid this hotel like the plague. Only plus side of the hotel was the location but even that doesn't make up for the discusting rat infested hotel. Also another point to be aware of is that EVERY TIME you leave the hotel you have to LEAVE YOUR ROOM KEY WITH THE RECEPTIONIST and don't know who goes into your room when you are not there. Breakfast.. don't even bother it was the most discusting food I have ever tasted. I wouldn't even rate this hotel as a 1 star let alone 3. Bed sheets and towels were dirty. This hotel needs to be closed down.,london_location_2011
UR65416048,2010-26-May,OMG...I have never in my entire life stayed in a complete sh*t ho*e like this one. It is without doubt the WORST hotel in the ENTIRE world.... I stayed one night and ended up covered in bites....I thought I was having a bad dream when I thought I was covered in insects...I wasn't !! The worst was to come in the early morning when a large rat strutted over the bed....appearing to feed on the various bugs I was previously subjected to !! The breakfast looked ok...but 30 minutes later I was hurling into the filthy toilet. The staff were extremely rude and laughed about the rat...they said it was a pet called BASIL !! Dear god...I would rather sleep in a public toilet then this.....but....it's good for something to talk about !! ENJOY !!,pigster_10
UR72015579,2010-23-July,Stayed in this hotel few years ago (2006)for few nights. While we stayed there for 4 nights the only good thing about the hotel was the location otherwise in 4 days. Our hotel room was robbed (passports/money everything gone) when enquired when we went to the room they said they had moved our stuff to the room next door. There were rats in the room. When checking out they were asking for money obviously we didnt have any as our room had been cleaned out (looked like a inside job),WordTraveller007
UR54164551,2010-23-January,I thought that if we had paid a good amount of money the hotel would be good enough - wrong! We checked in and went into the room and the first thing I noticed was the horrible stained yellowy pillows! On our way out I asked for new pillows for the room to be told 'oh the laundry hasn't come back yet so we had no pillowcases for your pillows but we will put them on later!' Needless to say for the two nights we were there I used a folded up towel instead of a pillow. The floor felt like it would give way any minute and the bathroom was incredibly small the room was also cold and dingy. Breakfast was about the only highlight! Holland is one of my favourite countries and I am sad that this hotel let me down a bit but the hotel is situated on the Damrak and is in walking distance of anywhere.,VodkaQueenLeicester
UR61988363,2010-20-April,We booked two rooms for this hotel for one night as we were stuck in Amsterdam. The location is great and the reception staff friendly. However the rooms were very poor for the money and did not appear that clean (though as there was very little natural light and very poor lighting it was hard to tell!!). Breakfast was from a buffet and we decided not to risk the rather dodgy looking hot stuff the cold stuff was OK though basic.,Johnn123
UR87471462,2010-18-November,When we arrived we were asked our payment for our to be made in full this made me suspisious. We were then shown to our room which was a bit of a treck up and down stairs (we would be in trouble if there was a fire) and we were shown our room which was like a bunker with a window that opened out onto a wall the bathroom was horrible like something you would expect to see in an institution. I immediately asked for a room change as I couldn't sleep in a room without a window in the basement! We were moved to a room at the front of the hotel right over the Chip shop. I bought sheets and a pillow case because the sheets supplied were so dirty. The bathroom was ditry it was a horrible place. I would not recommend this hotel and can't believe after all the negative comments that they wouldn't do something about it.,jackiekennedy
UR75153006,2010-14-August,OK I know Amsterdam is an expensive capital when it comes to accomodation but this doesnt mean that the hotels must take advantage of your needs for sleep. i stayed at the Delta Hotel and paid 73 euros for one night. I would not complained if my room had at least two basic needs. One a window (yes ther was NO window in my room) and the other thing a second pillow. The room itself was clean and the shower was more than satisfactory but the size of the room reminded me my days when I was in the Navy with USS Seawolf (SSN-21) in Connecticut! VERY VERY VERY SMALL!!! Good thing about the hotel though is its location. Would I stay there again? If I'd get the room for cheaper say 50 euros maybe but NEVER AGAIN IN ROOM 111 !!!,ancinimancini
UR70425639,2010-10-July,I stayed at the Delta in 2004 and just happened to check it on here now ! Thought id share my thoughts - when we first arrived into our room we noticed straight away the bin had no bag in it we wouldnt have minded but the bin was so dirty and smelly and had obviously not been cleaned in a long time . Then on looking behind the radiator i found dirty tissues of what use i dont want to know  Very restless sleep as beds not comfy and hardly any covers  started itching on the first night and by the fourth ( our last thank god ) i had bites on my back from what i imagine to be bed bugs. Its a pity as the hotel itself is in a Great Location ....,lynzclapperton
UR46008220,2009-6-October,My lovely partner and I arrived for a 5 day stay with Delta Hotel....we left on the first night what an absolute shambles the staff and place is. The rooms are so bad TV hanging off the wall moth holes in curtains shower broke so many things wrong with this hotel. I asked for an extra blanket as only one sheet on the bed the guy in reception then proceded to call me a stupid [--] blonde english [--] ranting then aggressively starting showing me how to use the radiator which was behind him and the same as the one in my room. It was uncalled for I was very polite in my asking and hadn't provoked him in any way. I could of complained about the fact that the place is a state looks nothing like the pictures on website and that we had originally asked for a double room and the room we got had two single beds not very romantic but I didn't mention any of that I just wanted a blanket for extra warmth. He kept ranting raving and at one point during his abuse I felt frightened as he was so aggressive (believe me I am one tough girl but this was scary!). We left and were told we would not get a refund (we paid 700) next day we went back to see the manager who told us he would refund the money and was very apologetic (or so we thought) gave him our credit card and he told us he had refunded the whole amount gave us a slip and when we checked with bank when we got back he had taken the full amount off the card on the day we complained the cheek of it!!!!!!! Unbelieveable I wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy.,zoe8102
UR27489476,2009-6-April,Ive stayed in hotels all over the world but Ive never stayed in anywhere that is so filthy as the Delta.The xcarpets are so dirty that you couldn`t possibly walk on them without shoes on.The rooms are thick with dust and filth.The only good thing about the place is that its in a very central position. It anoys me looking at all the reviews that the Delta obviously don`t care about the state of the place as they havn`t done anything to put things right..They really should read the reviews on their hotel.,barbaracheshunt
UR33950345,2009-5-July,As above.... I booked this hotel via myamsterdam.com (flight and hotel) the package was very cheap and yes you get what you pay for. Delta Hotel i shared a twin room with my teenage son the room was crawling yes i mean crawling with bed bugs... The second night i woke to find a black bug crawling on my arm i woke put on the light turned over my pillow and there were three more black bugs on closer inspection the sheets and pillows were also full of tiny bed bugs... At 4am i went to speak to the nights porter - complete waste of time as he was unable to help my situation - i asked if i could get a coffee and his reply was "No" so off to my flea crawling room i went sat up all night with the light on. Spoke to the manager who was very apologetic and would move us to another room... which he did - we slept but was sure glad to be leaving that morning....This hotel should never be rated *** The carpets were so filthy stained and should be thrown out windows stinking wall paper stained (in my room you will notice blood stains) thats where we crushed the bugs. Oh yes the manager said he would find out who was in the room prior to us and where they travelled from - I am now thinking do we need to go for blood tests!! Please DO NOT GO TO THIS HOTEL.,DAISYFLOWERWales
UR23249344,2009-4-January,arrived tues 29th dec 08 .waited 1 hour to be seen to. room was shabby filthy and woke to red beasts about finger nail length in our beds .window wouldnt shut .basic bed and tv that was it. went to reception and was told we had brought beasts with us from scotland and lAUGHED AT US.she said she phoned manager who finally turned up hour half later.at this time we had phoned home to inverness and my mother had arranged us to stay at holiday inn which was a fraction of the price and ten times better!!!!!,marlynInverness
UR24044578,2009-31-January,I`d been to Amsterdam before and we`d met a few people who were staying here so we thought it looked like a good location.It was.Central to everything and only a few minutes walk to central station. Howeverhotel was shabby.It should be a hostel.Carpets filthysheets filthy.In fact we slept on top of the covers.We were given a large spacious room that slept 5 and as there was only 3 of us in the room then there was lots of room.A couple who were with us weren`t so lucky.They were put inwhat could only be decribed as a cell..complete with bars on the windows and a view of a brick wall. Bathroom was mouldy and smelt bad.Towels weren`t fresh and no one would replace themso went and bought my own. Staff were exteremely unhelpful and I think they pretended they didn`t understand what we were asking.We weren`t rude or anything. On the second night there was a group of men fighting out in the corridorwhich went on all night.They were punching each other and kept banging on our door for us to let them in.They were cursing at us through the door.Very frightening so some security would be good!! Breakfast was okbut only if you can`t wait to get elsewhere for some.If you are thinking of staying herethink again.I highly recommend an Apartment instead.We done this the first time and if there is a group of you then its a cleanermore comfortable and cheaper choice.,blueraven1
UR26547100,2009-21-March,I have never stayed in such a dump. Rooms are horrible I awoke during the night to a cockroach in my bed!! Rooms are like something from hundreds of years ago and the elevator in this place is an absolute joke. I would not recommend a dog to even stay here. I don't know why this place hasn't been closed down by health and safety.,eurotravellerIreland
UR27302045,2009-2-April,Oh my god! My fiance and i have just came back from Amsterdam and stayed at the Delta. We booked this as it was supposed to be a 3 star and near all the attractions. I wouldnt even give this hotel a 1* its a tip! It needs a complete overhall its dirty old and the staff are not polite and the lift is temperamental and covered in graffiti which they tried to disguise with a price list for the resturant thats attached where we ate our breakfast thats if there was any left they didnt refill any of the breakfast and if you ask for a mug for your coffee or tea. my god they have a fit! All the hotel has got going for it is the location. Even saying that id rather catch a tram to the nearest attraction than stay at this hotel again. I dont know how that hotel has not been closed down..and they even asked for a 50 euro deposit when we arrived and they asked jokingly when we checked out if we had broken anythinghaha not amused as theres nothing to break or take....Amsterdam itself has loads to see but very expensive. Make sure you take plenty of euros and got your walking shoes on.,sana-b33
UR47183247,2009-18-October,Arrived and told to wait 3 hours for the room (despite arriving at the correct time). After being told our room was ready we found cigarette butts sick and a bit of a disaster zone was our room. We complained we tried to get a refund we even called the police (who were lovely). Sadly we had to stay but were given the best room (not a great improvement) and a free beer for our troubles. After the initial shock we were happy with it's extremely central location. Would never recommend this place though.,traxdata2k
UR32616246,2009-18-June,I went a few years ago and although its the most basic hotel i have ever stayed in it was ok for what we needed and situtated in a perfect place Anyway the staff have got to be the rudest and most ignorant i have come across and the young Irish guy that works there was very close to getting a slap for the way he spoke to some of our younger travellers. oh and we were promised 10% off food and drink before we booked only to be told we could not have it once we arrived! Anyway it was cheap and we spent most of the time out so we put up with it! I am returning to Amsterdam again soon and i did a search for hotels and this came up with the prices and i burst out laughing what a rip off!!! Do not pay the prices they charge it's like roughing it big time. Amsterdam is a great place to Visit but i would stay well clear of this dirty dump!!!!!,manorblade
UR38025743,2009-18-August,The hotel is very central and that's about all. It is dirty and generally unkempt. The bedding was clean but the mattresses were stained. It is noisy because the trams are running all hours but that is not their fault. It is generally unfinished and old. Although the reception staff were helpful.,GILLYB007.
UR24623810,2009-16-February,the pictures on the hotel website certainly dont match what you get! we were situated on the 5th floor room size a large singleroom wardobe door catches in double bed on opening you dont get a doulble sheet to cover you you get 2 singles also what they dont tell you is that on top floor is the heating system which comez on every morning at 6am and vibrates your room! also what kind of hotel has an iron but ironing board whe asked what should i use i was told maybe your bed! location wise is good but this place needs to SERIOUSLY revamp its facilities ie bedrooms tolietsbut never in million years would i return to this "hotel" if your like cheap and not so cheerful this is for your but if you require a good nights sleep then dont they also dont mention that they are very near a church whose bells go off every 30 mins from about 6am to 12pm! it well worth to spend an extra few euro to find an actual decent hotel!,antog09
UR41434840,2009-13-September,This hotel is terrible. The hotel is dirty and disorganized. The breakfast is very poor and the staaf is not polite. I hated to stay there. I don't recomend. Renata,renatagh
UR37598677,2009-13-August,We are just back home after a one night stay in the Delta Hotel in Amsterdam. I knew when we booked that I was taking a risk with this cheap (given its location) hotel. We were prepared for a very basic set up which was exactly what we got. However what we hadnt expected was an extremely rudeignorant and charmless manger . Not only was he rude to us but also to his staff. When I commented on his behaviour he said 'thank you'! Also beware booking through online hotel agencies and not using a credit card. A young italian tried to check in before us and the hotel staff checked the hotel bank account to make sure they had received his money transfer. They had not and he was forced to pay again. The bed linen towels and the bathroom were clean and there was plenty of hot water. Other than this the place is dirty smells of damp and is run down. The bathroom door handle came off in my partners hand. If your trip is only for one night and you plan to spend no time in the hotel other than to sleep then you may just be able to survie a trip to the hotel Delta. I would however seriously recommend a trip to a coffee shop to help you feel better about the place before you attempt to sleep there for a night. We certainly wont be going back.,Loves2travelmore
UR14158344,2008-9-March,This is never a three star hotel. The location is fantastic but the hotel is horrible. The rooms are shoddy the carpet is threadbare it was more like a youth hostel.,barnieboy
UR17606894,2008-7-July,Booked the hotel via EasyJet Hotels - don't they ever check out what they recommend?! I shared a room with my father in law - 4th to 6th July 2008. The single beds we had were small and both beds were up against opposite walls with a gap of 14 inches in between - gives you an idea of how small the room was. The carpet and walls ceilings paintwork was ancient and filthy - only the bathroom was relatively clean. The furniture appeared to have been purchased from Oxfam - several years ago! Bannister rails were missing from staircase walls. Breakfast was included in the price - but there was hardly any choice - fruit bread cereal salami boiled eggs scambled egg and very fatty bacon - plan for breakfast elsewhere! Basically if you're considering it - book elsewhere. If you've booked it - unlucky (as we were)!,SnapperMike
UR14859889,2008-7-April,It's been a few years... but I'll sum it up: When I first came in from Damrak I noticed the lobby was bit funky smelling. When I checked in I got hit with a 70e deposit (which was later given back at check out). It was a bit dim and somebody was passed out in the middle of the lobby. The room apppeared to be clean. I opened the curtains and my view was a brick wall and some trash strewn around the ground. The WC was decent and clean and there were towels. Very basic. I went out after a shower for some beers and food. When I came back later that night I was scolded by the front desk personel for not leaving my key with them. The ventilation in my room was quite poor and I couldn't sleep that well... i just sweated in bed all night... Check out was a easy enough...except having to make my way around about 50 dudes and their baggage through the tiny and stuffy lobby. Not exactly a honeymoon resort. The people hanging around the area just outside after 10pm are up to no good... go there with your buddy or alone for a quick stay and get the hell out. Central Station is very close...,Schipholio
UR18336341,2008-28-July,Expedia sold this dump as a *** Hotel - no chance! Our room - booked as double - just about had enough space to fit in a double bed. No walking round the edges so you had to climb on the bed to get into it. No bedside light so to turn the light off you had to get off the bed to walk across the room down a step round a corner to the light switch and then retrace your steps in the dark. The window directly overlooked another room which I realised when getting undressed as the bed was directly under the window. Result: curtains closed throughout. One light didn't work and had to be replaced. TV collapsed and had to be replaced. Carpet worn. On the plus side (everyone has to be positive!) the staff were friendly and the breakfast was fine. Advice: go if you get a ** price but not otherwise.,OnwardTraveller
UR13828901,2008-25-February,This is my second stay in Amsterdam so I have something to compare with. Do yourself a favour and stay somewhere else. The website says the hotel has been renovated but as the staff advised only the bathrooms have been done. The rooms are tiny what I expected. The mattress is about 30 years old. I wanted to use the spare pillows in the room but when I saw them I would not let my dog sleep on them. I did not dare check under the pillowcases! We were a party of 4 couples in 4 rooms. Two of us were bitten all over the body by something. I challenged the reception staff and they said that they had tested for bugs 2 weeks before and were told they were clean. Coincedence I think not. I accept that you get what you pay for 218 euro for 2 nights but I think you will do better without any problem. While the breakfast is free it is of little value if you cannot eat it.,Covgooner
UR22127755,2008-24-November,Very worn out and tatty. Noisy at the front as the windows were poor and didn't shut properly. Breakfast included but poor (didn't think you could get coffee that bad outside the UK). Don't leave it too late to have a shower in the morning as the hot water runs out. We've stayed in Amsterdam several times before and know you won't get luxury unless you pay a small fortune but all in all the Delta is about what you'd expect for half the price. The only good thing about it is it's location.,tampopotwo
UR17116748,2008-22-June,Stayed here last weekend and can honestly say without doubt that this is the worst hotel we have ever stayed in and that's saying something. Reception clerk was rude demanding and completely insincere. Hotel staff were non-existent. The room itself was on the 1st floor with barred windows overlooking a ledge with all sorts of age old muck and grime including a long dead bird. The bed was ancient lumpy and totally uncomfortable and looked distinctly unclean. The wife wore more clothes to bed than when outside. The carpets were disgusting and horribly stained all over. All in all I would seriously recommend the closure of this place and a total rebuild carried out. Avoid like the Plague for youe own health.,kissrocks
UR21020668,2008-20-October,3* no way..... It is the most disgusting place i have ever stayed in and i couldnt wait for the two nights to be over. The hotel is a tiny dingy place and after seeing the room we were allocated i just wanted to run out of the place but knew we wouldnt find any place else at such short notice. The windows were all broken and the wood rotten. The bed just about fit in the room and no space at all around it. you would have to climb in to it from the bottom. Needless to say there were no bedside lockers. The room was so dark. The carpet was so filthy and the sheets on the bed stained. I couldnt figure out how they could justify selling this room at all. Revolting.The bathroom although tiny was relatively clean. Of course i went to reception and told them i couldnt possibly stay in such a room and the receptionist gave me keys of two other rooms to look at. They were just a fraction better so we choose one. The beds in that place should all be burnt. If the carpet was clean i would probably have slept on the floor they were so uncomfortable. One evening while we were waiting in reception for friends another guest came down waving a rubber mask and demanding to know how it got in his shower. He was furious and said it wasnt there when he left his room in the morning. Weird or what but he wasnt one bit impressed. The only thing you could eat at breakfast was the toast. The scrambled eggs were like rubber and the bacon was swimming in a couple inches of fat. The fruit was tinned with the exception of a basket of oranges and you were lucky to find a cup for your coffee. I was ever so glad to get out of the place. A vending machine in the hotel lobby offered snacks at 2.50 each for twix kitkat etc. RIP OFF. I must say the reception staff were nice and it did appear that many things were way out of their control. Management on the other hand should be held accountable.,Adah
UR13996563,2008-2-March,We just returned from a weekend in Amsterdam.We stopped at the Delta with 3 x other couples 2 of the couples were being bit by bed bugs. The breakfast was disgusting everyhting was cold and had been sitting there from early morning until 10-00am. The rooms were dark and dismal even though they say it has been refurbished recently. The staff were pleasant and helpful and the only good point about the hotel was the shower was good. Do not stop here.,bluejinty
UR18979075,2008-15-August,The pictures and the reality could not be more different... I will compain to the local hotels association in Amsterdam. When I arrived I was perplexed by the rather gloomy reception. When I entered the room I was shocked - for GB Pounds 95.00 and 3 stars I was expecting something akin to what I can expect in London... for 3 stars and less. This "hotel" should be immediately downgraded to a "hostel" and actual photos reflect the spartan and amateurishly cleaned room. I stayed in 366 - a single room facing what can only be described as an ashtray where even the malfuntioning TV reflected this Adams Family horror story masquerading as a venue fit for human habitation. Do not stay here no matter how desperate... I refer you to the following link for more of the same... [--],Frequent_Flyer_2008
UR10715901,2007-9-November,This review is long overdue (stayed at the Delta in summer 2003). This was hands down the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. The only positive I can think of is it's location close to Centraal Station. The staff was uncaring our room was not ready when promised the room was depressingly dark and run-down. The bathroom was in desperate need of attention (loose fixtures chipped tiles). The room's closet/wardrobe was dangerously close to falling apart. The door lock didn't work properly and we felt unsafe the entire night we stayed there. I would not rate the Delta Hotel even a one out of five.,mjjjm5
UR6908561,2007-4-March,Well how disappointed were we on opening the door to our room. The room looked nothing like the rooms advertised on the website. In fact we were given a tiny attic room (Anne Franks room was larger!) The room had a small wardrobe that was broken. The lights by the bed didn't work. The towels had holes in them. The bathroom or washroom was moldy and the shower didn't work properly. One minute the water was running cold and the next you got scalded by boiling water. There was a gaping hole in the wall for ventilation through which I could see daylight. We left the hotel one morning to fly home having found that there was absolutely no hot or cold water in our room. We were told it would be a few minutes! After breakfast we returned to our room approximately an hour after speaking to reception about the water and there was still no water we couldn't even brush our teeth or have a wash! We feel that we were misled by the photographs on the web site and the wording. Paying in advance which is also wrong as once you have paid there was no way of getting your money back or changing hotel. The rate was extortionate considering the condition of the room we were given. The only thing the Hotel had going for it was the location and the staff.,topcat067
UR11090957,2007-27-November,Stayed there for a friends birthday and all we wanted was a bed for the night in a good location and that is all it is. It was not perticularly cheap 230 Euros for 2 nights in a single room I think is steep for what it is. The single room I was in was tiny and I mean tiny it was cleanish but could do with a refurb. The staff were very friendly. The breakfast was just about edible! Would I stay here again NO!,MancReviewer
UR7215075,2007-24-March,When we arrived at the hotel the reception was lovely and clean but when we went around the corner to go up the stairs the smell started the place was filthy dirty I dont think the place has ever seen a hoover since it opened and the walls in the hall were rotten with dirt and blood all I could think I sope the room is not like this. I opened the room door and there was just enough room for the bed it was tiny and the carpet on the floor and yes the walls was rotten. The shower was tiny good job im a small person. Overall I did not enjoy my stay there at all. A bit of advice take your slippers or something if you want to walk from the bed to the shower oh and a pair of earplugs the noise at night is terrible.,lisatreanor1
UR10089623,2007-17-October,Me and four friends recently went for a weekend in the dam.We booked the Delta through a amsterdam based company.Upon arriving to the front desk at around 12 midday we were made to wait 20mins by the rude staff who totally ignored us.The 5 person "room" was more a loike a one man gas chamber!!!The room had an awful scent of what i can only describe as urine.Oh and more before we were given the key to our room we had to pay 26.50E each for T.V remote!! We complained 2days in a row to which there was no response. Day 2 was'nt much better either ..when by friend came back to the room saying he had just seen around 3-4 mice in a little doorway on the stairs.I couldnt believe it until i seen the state of the resurant that morning for breakfast. Stay away from this place unless you like flea bites,danreeves
UR10082849,2007-15-October,Wish the reviews on Easy to Book had been as honest as we may have reconsidered staying at this hotel. The location is undisputedly ideal but the hotel description could start with "Don't get your hopes up!" followed by "Shabby and scabby". We were stuck in an attic room (ironically referred to as the penthouse by receptionist) which was dingy musky no tea coffee facilities a shower with no shower curtain and the water flooded the toilet. Sink in the bedroom rather than the toilet. Stains on carpetswalls light fittings. Manky window that didn't close. Curtain that didn't cover the window. Having booked a double room we stupidly expected a double bed with double sheets etc. (how naive) We found two single sheets two single duvets and cushions disguised as pillows on a double bed! When we had the impertinence to ask for a double duvet and sheets the receptionist said "We don't have many." At 364 Euros for 3 nights we didn't think that a double duvet came only for business class. On the up side - the whole scenario provided much hilarity after we'd visited the local coffee shops! ( Laughter quickly disappeared on returning home and finding insect bites on my shoulder ) Easy to book should take responsibility for advertising this place as a three star establishment. This "hotel" could easily be mistaken for a hostel but should reflect this in their prices.,n0rrie
UR8711625,2007-14-September,Staying for two nights over a weekend was just bearable the cost to quality ratio didnt seem fair To say it is a three star accommodation is an insult to those hoteliers who try hard to gain there stars. I stayed on the ground floor with very poor security and zero hotel lobby facilities; it seemed like a hostel rather than hotel. The lobby was used as a store for spare seats from the restaurant one of the two highly priced vending machines was turned off on a trolley and the shoe cleaner was out of order. The room lights were very dim with unsafe looking television stands lumpy pillows no instructions for the safe and a shower that didnt let the water run down. The final insult was the breakfast The toaster hadnt been plugged into the wall and on the same day the coffee urn was just full of warm water. The food selection was basic if not in bulk. Ive never gone to Amsterdam expecting quality but if your on business and need a place to relax after a days work look for somewhere else.,LondonPippo
UR7588398,2007-11-May,Do not ever consider staying at this dump.this is without question the worst hotel in the world.not fit for human habitation.its a disgrace that its still allowed to rip off tourists.when my wife complained about the condition of the room i.e.used condoms etc.the manager became very aggressive and when we cancelled our stay they refused to return the full monies they had deducted from our credit card.this is without doubt the worst hotel in amsterdam.it shoulsd be closed down immediatly as a health risk.take my advice dont even consider staying at this kip. I even complained to the dutch tourist office about this place. Tourist Belfast,belfasttouristttt

UR5042726,2006-8-May,Not as expected. Booked on Easy to Book as 3-star hotel. Surely not. Dirty entrance and lift. Lift works but slow. Men hanging around reception most of day. Quiet room amazing on this busy street. Room v small carpet stained grout in bathroom dirty ceiling leaked and stained and lumpy like something is growing under it furniture badly chipped. Sink by the bed toilet and shower through separate door smelly no real ventilation. The food was passable tinned fruit eggs but there were cats in the kitchen. Main problem was someone opened my door in the night. I left at 5.30 the next morning. The receptionist was rude and unhelpful and said she was going to charge for two nights because I was cancelling. It was not a cancellation I moved because I felt unsafe. The person in charge only comes in on Tues. My advice avoid this I paid 100 E a night and it is definitey not worth it and in my opinion not safe.,Gardentraveler52
UR5298190,2006-4-June,Don't book this hotel by what you see on the website as the pictures are very misleading. I hope you don't get Room 006 unless you like views of walls - there was a brick wall in the room and a brick wall 3 feet outside the window (in front and on both sides of the window). It was so dark that we had to have the light on whatever time of day it was. There were a pair of men's underpants outside the window and also a pair of jeans - both had been there some time. I did inform reception but not sure that anything will be done about it. We were also charged about an extra 40 Euros tax when we arrived on top of the price we were quoted - this came as a surprise to us. It is in no way a 3* hotel and I don't consider that 320+ Euros for 3 nights is cheap. The breakfast was poor and the staff were very slow replenishing dishes and cutlery. I was told one morning that I would have to wait 10 minutes for a cereal bowl as that's how long the machine takes to wash them!! The only plus is that the hotel is ideally situated for most attractions.,LynMumford
UR5016511,2006-28-April,This is the worst hotel that I have ever stayed in!! We have travelled all over the USA most of Western Europe all over the East coast of Australia many places in India and a few countries of Asia from 5* to caravan parks this still makes the 'grade' as one of the worst in terms of price-value proposition (paid on average with tax Eu125 per day for a triple that's more than what I paid in Paris for a place near the Louvre!!). My observations: (1) Our triple room was furnished (or rather unfurnished) in the most basic manner (3 single beds a TV a table & chair 2 side tables in a bare walled room) (2) The bathroom was a reasonable size but there was a noise every 3 or 4 mins from the wall some kind of a water sound for all the 4 days we were there. There was a liquid soap dispenser at the basin one in the bath 3 towels (no hand towel no floor towel) nothing else. Oh yes one dead BIG cockroach which remained just under the toilet seat for all the days we were there. (3) First day came back to see room not cleaned bathroom not cleaned towels not changed but too late in the night to get someone to come in as we just wanted to sleep. (4) Second day told at the reception to make sure room done but came back to see the same status. Went back to tell the reception before going out to dinner were assured it would be done but when we came back past 10pm it was still undone. Begged for towels and got them. (5) Third day made a BIG noise and finally it did get done. But the cockroach remained where it had been!!! My advice don't go there. It offers facilities like a hostel at prices of a good hotel. Its a rip off. Location is the only good thing about this place.,Sujaa
UR5014987,2006-27-April,When I stayed there by myself a few years ago the bathroom was ok clean sheets and lock on the door was all I needed. I fought a cockroach from picking off of my breakfast plate downstairs. In the night stand there was a dirty sock and a small plastic bag left behind and I had the "maid" re-vacuum before I headed out to the coffee shops. He did anything that I asked and did it with a smile a sincere smile. Plus it helped that he spoke french (I was studying in France at the time) and not much english. It was close to the Red Light District and didn't have far to go back. I would stay there again because it was cheap and when I come back after being in the coffee shops and sight-seeing I know everything was taken care of in the beginning.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR5823247,2006-21-September,After arriving at the Hotel I realised I'd been given a two single bed room which was adequate at best. I'm not that fussy generally but the place cost me about 125 a night. Was shabby in need of repair and basic. When I went to sleep that night on a rock hard mattress and was bitten by Fleas or whatever was in the bed. The next morning I had no sleep had massive lumps and bite marks all over my back (even my forehead) When I complained that night they didn't seem to care and I asked for another room. No better but minus the fleas. I travel all over the world every week and have never stayed in a hotel this poor especially for the asking price. Oh and the only hotel I have ever stayed in that couldn't even supply me with an iron. I know I'm a business traveller but as long as a place is clean I'm happy. Absolute DUMP. Tell people you don't like to stay there.,randygit
UR5492395,2006-21-July,I have to say that if you are looking for an enjoyable stay in Amsterdam you would do well to steer well away form this hotel ( i use the term hotel very loosley). The bathrooms were terrible and the rooms were so much worse. Clean towels? Fresh bedsheets? these are just few of the things you will NOT find here.The only point worth mentioning is its location...it is ideally located near centraal station and other local amenities.,dan90120
UR6472963,2006-19-December,We got there and I was a bit surprised when they chrged our entire stay the moment we checked in. This way if you want to leave you can't because you've already paid for your stay. The rooms were small and the bathroom primative. The worst part is when we got back to the hotel late with food and the "door man" told us we had to eat in the lobby because they don't allow food in the rooms because the cleaning crew did not want to clean uo the mess. NO FOOD IN THE ROOMS IT'S AMSTERDAM!! I will NEVER stay there again.,Soomany
UR5066040,2006-13-May,I fortunately was not staying at this hotel but called there for the 'full English breakfast'. It took 35 minutes to arrive waitress was OK problem was the kitchen staff. The breakfast was not up to scratch either!! Very poor performance.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR5458687,2006-12-July,We as a college group stayed in this hotel. There was 8 girls in a room and now imagine 8 girls in a room all getting ready at the one time to go out. To our suprise there was only 1 shower which i thought was a disgrace and to make matters worse you wouldnt call it a shower i had to stand on my tip toes and lay against the wall to get nearer the shower and the water that was coming out of it would barely wash your face it was a disgrace. There was no bath. Our friends had baths. The hotel staff are very noisy and creepy. The Breakfast in the restuarant if you would call it that was not great. The only good thing about this hotel is its near everything such as the train station trams and the red light. If i was to go back to amsterdam i would find a better hotel as this hotel was in my opinion a disgrace. It looked more like a hostel to me....,mich007
UR5935376,2006-10-October,I thought it was a joke at first. we walked into a room with a bare mattress which had yellow stains all over it. The bath towels were all ripped with red stains on them. The cups by the sink had crusted white residue all over them. When we complained they basically laughed at us. They would not let us cancel our other two nights so we ended up having to stay in this horrible place.,thry
UR3745772,2005-8-August,We stayed just one night in this hotel and although we weren't expecting it to be brilliant as we read these reviews (after booking unfortunately) we weren't prepared for the smell! The actual public areas weren't too bad and everwhere seemed reasonably clean (apart from the windows) but when we walked into our small room we noticed they had opened the window wide (luckily we had one). The room smelled of stale smoke and sweat. It was only when we opened the wardrobe we noticed a brown stained pillow at the bottom and in all honesty i have never smelt anything like it!!I joked that the pillows on the bed probably smelt the same so we had a look and they were just as bad. The covers were clean but i dread to think how old the pillows and quilt where. We actually slept on top of the bed and used our clothes as pillows. Im no snob but i couldn't bring myself to get in! I agree with the other reviews about the breakfast edible but the book "Green Eggs and Ham" springs to mind! I suppose this hotel is Ok for stag does etc or if you're not fussey about were you sleep but i wouldn't recommend it and it certainly put a damper on our trip to Amsterdam. Luckily my husband and myself both have a good sense of humor and i would say that this is a reqiurement of staying in this hotel!,A TripAdvisor Member
UR4250174,2005-19-December,I spent 4 nights in this Hotel for a long weekend break. Heres the breakdown: Day 1: Checked in the Hotel late Friday Evening There will charge of 40 deposit (refundable after when you checked out) this is because you don't trash your hotel room etc. But I understood that. So far so good. Day 2: All hotels guest get free breakfast from 7:30am  10AM which was not bad. During naptime the heater was making an annoying whistling noise every few minutes. I couldnt sleep. I went down to the reception & explained problem they did not have any other rooms so I had to live with it. Day 3: I was moved to another room in the morning at night whilst I was a sleep I got up to get some water and to my surpriseI saw 2 mice running around my room I was shocked & disgusted. So I immediately went to the reception & explained the problem they moved me straight away to another room (the deluxe suite). I was asked if I was eating in my room I said no. They said to me I will have to move in the morningNO NOT AGAIN! By the way no eating is allowed in your room!! No wonder! Day 4: That morning the manager apologised for what had happened and it was OK for me to spend my final night in the Deluxe Suite. There were no problems during that night. During Check-Out I got any apology from the staff but I did not get any discounts or reductions Bad Points: - Mice Noisy Heaters Bad Showers. Good Points: - In a perfect location 5 mins from Centraal Station close to RLD Dam Square etc all pretty much in walking distance. I cant say if I will every stay here again.,mrcool76
UR3790634,2005-19-August,Very central close to station and Dam square. You have to pay up frount for the loan of a TV remote. The room was small ( I dont really mind that as many are in Amsterdam) the room was dirty and the shower room disgusting curtains were full of cig burn - not exactly classy but if your looking for a central hotel then this is for you.,goodship
UR3014437,2005-18-January,Stayed 15-17 January 2005 wobbly WC cold and inedible breakfast Shower was either red hot or ice cold in seconds. Not worth the money,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3761392,2005-14-August,Stayed here for a Stag Do. Rooms were OK although one of our foursomes ended up with the attic room which wasn't fit for storage let alone accommodation. Admittedly when another room became available they were moved. All was going OK until checkout when they tried to sting us for phone calls we hadn't made and premium channels we hadn't watched. Needless to say we refused to pay and they eventually waived the fees. Then a month after checkout a mysterious 150 charge appeared on my bank statement. They'd taken it upon themselves to debit my account for a tv we allegedly threw on the floor. Absolute rubbish. Currently trying to get this money back from them. In my opinion although the accommodation was OK and the location was good I would never recommend to anyone I know staying here as it might end up costing you a ----sight more than you bargained for !!,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3355352,2005-13-April,Just come back from a 3 day hen party in Amsterdam. Did not expect the Ritz for the price we paid and our quad bedroom(apart from damp in bathroom) was adequate and clean enough but some other party members had horrific rooms with little or no windows in them and litter scattered around the place. The attitude of the staff is to say the least downright ignorrant it doesn't get you anywhere when you complain because they couldn't care less about you. We didn't spend much time in the hotel so get what you pay for I guess but would not reccommend this hotel to anyone even my enemies! Some customer care wouldn't go amiss with the so called manager. Wouldn't last 5 minutes in this country!,JCT41
UR4106347,2005-11-November,Dirty hot room. Took 3 days before they put a fan in the room. Windows opened inwards and you walked into them if you had to go to the toilet during the night. Carpet on the wall? Very strange. Grubby bathroom. Breakfast unusual okay if you like eating off chipped plates and cups. Certainly not worthy of its 3 stars. Only good thing going for it is location. Have stayed in better 2 stars in Amsterdam. Only book this if its cheap and you're not fussy.,A TripAdvisor Member
