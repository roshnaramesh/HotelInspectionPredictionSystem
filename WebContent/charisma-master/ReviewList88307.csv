UR124353477,2012-9-February,Grand Seas Resorts 1-7-2012 to 1-12-2012 When we arrived we were greeted warmly and told that they would charge a $50 deposit to our credit card that day. We thought that was unusual. Our first room had a kitchen that was extremely small and to our way of thinking unusable. The television blanked out repeatedly. The sink does not have a garbage disposal. They do not provide filters for the coffee maker so that had to be our first trip to the store. Since we had exchanged a Marriott Barony Beach property for this through Interval International we were very disappointed with the Grand Seas. The Grand Seas is only 25% of the property we deposited for the exchange. We arrived late and didnt check everything out before falling into a very uncomfortable bed. In the morning we discovered ants every where in the master bedroom. We then moved down to the second floor to a unit that had a much better kitchen still without a garbage disposal. 3 of the 4 outlets in the kitchen did not work and one of the outlets did not have a cover on it. A call to the front desk got that corrected. After walking around the room for a while in our bare feet and socks we discovered that the floors are so dirty that the bottoms of our feet turned black. It was disgusting. We called to have the floors washed. Really!!! The bottom cover of the refrigerator was missing and we had a wonderful view of a rusting gaping hole. I dont know how fast things rust down here but this looks like it has been through a few hard winters driving the streets of Boston. The exhaust fan vents were caked with dust the kind that you get if you dont clean them for several months. Housekeeping came and cleaned our room. They say they washed the floor but our feet still turn black when we walk from the bedroom to the kitchen and then to the living room. When they cleaned the exhaust vent in the shower they left black foot prints on the bottom of the shower. We had to wash the shower before we could use it. The television in the second bedroom did not work. They came and changed it out and couldnt get that television to work either. I dont expect them to come back voluntarily. Internet service is very problematic. It keeps dropping out. It goes from excellent service to no service over and over again.,ChuckS160
UR131549828,2012-8-June,We are finishing up our stay at this resort tomorrow and I want to share my thoughts while they are fresh. Front desk personnel were extremely rude and unaccommodating when I just called down to complain about the piercing alarm sound that has gone off in the room every 2 minutes for the last half hour. Apparently maintenance is testing the alarm system and they "can do nothing about it" what was extra insulting is the glee with which they say "my pleasure" at the end of every call whether it was pleasant for the customer or not! This is our last day here and boy are we glad to be headed home tomorrow! Upon arrival we were permitted to check in an hour early as our room was ready.That was nice. We were informed that we had to see the concierge to get our "pool bracelets". This is their ruse to get you to go face to face with the guy who will attempt to schedule you to attend a breakfast sales presentation. There is no real breakfast (donuts and coffee) and the presentation takes more than an hour. We went for the free "sand dollars" (resort credit for meals). The vacation package/plan they are selling is a big ripoff but the little restaurant Gilligans has a good breakfast special and the food was yummy (and the Gilligans staff is very very nice) and you can use your sand dollars there if you choose to endure the sales pitch to get them. FYI- nobody seems to be checking for those bracelets at the pool. In fact they do not seem to care much about whatever goes on around here. The room was old floors were dirty as others have observed no hangers in the closet (we had to call 3x to get some) fixtures old dust and other peoples' odd junk (hair ties books) found behind furniture. No garbage disposal whirlpool jets in the tub spewed black gunk. Brought plenty of lysol products and decided that we are basically camping out. The view is awesome from the upper floors almost worth the grief of dealing with the rude and unhelpful staff and the sub-par accommodations. The one day our room was to be cleaned was Wednesday but staff came in on Tuesday while we were at breakfast. Our belongings were tossed into corners floor was mopped but fold away bed was left open so a large bit of the floor was left unmopped. Strong smell of bleach in the room was the first tipoff that they had been by. We were not pleased. We have stayed at many different places via timeshare exchanges but this was by far the worst both with regard to the facility and the staff. Daytona is great come on down here anytime and you will have fun- just stay somewhere else!,smartimom
UR133659123,2012-7-July,I wanted to get away for a few days for a little bit of R&R. We can all use a quick break now and then. Statistically speaking there is no where near enough parking to accommodate the size of the resort. For a resort that charges these prices the focus should always be on customer service. There were no staff to greet you as you pull up to the front door nor was there room to turn around. I walk into the resort and immediately there was already a confrontation going on about an incorrect reservation. Instead of empathizing with the guest the front desk just shook their head and continued to argue with the guest. Either the front desk personnel were not trained properly or the owner does not care. I then had to find where the carts were find my car unload it in the pouring rain and attempt to get this cart into my room to unload it. I was also surprised to find that all the studios didi not have a balcony as advertised. There were paint chips falling from the ceiling at the window obviously in need of repair. The mattress was old and sagged in the middle. I had made two more trips to the front desk for information only to find confrontations with dissatisfied guests each time. There were plenty of staff around but no one would help with any issues and often speak in their own foreign language during one of the front desk confrontations. This resort could be so much better than what it is-but then again who would pick this up but a strategic business analyst.

UR127438599,2012-7-April,We arrived at the resort to find almost a 30 minute wait at check in. This did not bother us too much as we knew it was spring break. However once we got checked in and went up to our room our key did not work. We had to go back down and the lady at the front desk gave us new keys. We went back up to the room and they key still did not work. There were two maintenance workers that met us at the door and said the key was not going to work and they had told the front desk this. Maintenance used their master key and opened the room to a room packed to the ceiling with extra furniture filing cabinets etc. We went back down to the front desk and the lady who checked us in could not even be bothered to come out of the back office to apologize. In fact there was no apology from any of the staff. We finally received keys that worked to room that was not clean. We were supposed to have a room with two queen beds and ended up a murphy bed and a pull out couch. We didn't complain. We kept the room. We only stayed one night in this hotel and during the one night we stayed we found an empty box of condoms a half empty bottle of vodka in the freezer woman's toiletry trash on the floor in the bathroom and a ball cap in the murphy bed. In the bathroom there was hair all over the floor. We had to put towels on the floor and scoot around so we did not touch the floor. There would have been absolutely no way we would have stayed for more than one night in this hotel. It is one of the worst hotels I have stayed in.,Rita T
UR127278780,2012-5-April,Interval International also led us astray during the fall of 2011 by booking us in this resort and trying to pass it off as a "premier" resort. I am convinced that they save the most horrible suites for the Interval customers!! We also had a dirty unit. We had to go to Walmart to buy cleaning supplies to clean the room before we would sit on anything. The refrigerator was rusted out and covered up by a poor coat of latex paint on the outside. Water damaged cabinets in the kitchen were glaring along with rusted out dish racks in the dishwasher. Not sure who gets balconies but our room had windows with no balcony. The outside of the resort was in a nasty state of disarray and the staff were rude. I wrote a letter to Interval upon our return and just received a mild "gee that's too bad" - Please think twice about staying at this resort.,nocnurse1966
UR127236407,2012-4-April,Compared to our past experiences w/ Interval resorts (particularly Boston Custom House and Royal Mayan) this "resort" was extremely disappointing and we would suggest that Interval remove it from their inventory until such time that there are major renovations/upgrades and it is brought up to the standards expected by Interval members. We had initially booked an efficiency unit but declined the one assigned when we realized that the Murphy bed was approximately 15 inches off the floor and there was paint spattered on the kitchen floor. We were told that all efficiency units have Murphy beds - a fact not noted on our confirmation page. We were told by the resort that we could "upgrade" for $150 for the week. After phoning Interval to complain we were advised that we would receive a waiver for the next time we exchange. My husband and I agreed and were given the keys to a one bedroom unit. Upon entering we noted a minimum of TEN DEAD INSECTS on the floor plus TWO dead insects on the headboard of the bed. Again we returned to the lobby to decline the second room and were given keys to Rm 5010. After nearly 90 minutes of being hassled we were finally in a marginal but more acceptable room. The Grand Seas is more of a glorified six story motel - the building inside and out is poorly maintained. Outside we noted chipping paint rusting around elevator openings filthy elevator doors paint spatters everywhere broken glass and other debris by the steps leading to the beach which were present for our entire six day stay trash containers that were full for several days at a time plus incessant country music in the lobby and on the ground floor. Inside Rm 5010 we noted chipped floor tiles stained grout dirty bathrooms dirty soap dish in bath/shower stained toilet seat lid dirty hand prints on all doors furniture that was chipped wall that had paper/sheetrock peeled off/paint missing windows that needed washing stained seat cushion on furniture and stains on curtains in living and bedrooms. Another major negative is that the Grand Seas does not allow anyone to move lounge chairs from the pool to the beach area and one would have to rent such lounge chairs from a vendor at an absurd cost of $35/day per chair. There are several positives to this resort  the young women who helped us to obtain a more suitable room were pleasant and the maintenance worker arrived within 10 minutes to repair the door lock. Although there are no balconies on the upper floors the view of the beach was gorgeous from our 5th floor room and the location was convenient to grocery store restaurants museum. However it is laughable that there are numerous Interval plaques on the wall behind the main desk in the lobby that proclaim the Grand Seas a Premier and 5 Star Resort.,JVCNP
UR123923302,2012-31-January,This once was a lovely place but today is drab and depressing. It was slightly seedy feeling. There are many conveniences around the resort such as a supermarket and restaurants but the accomodations don't live up to modern standards. Slightly dirty group of mentally challenged adults living there staff was friendly but poorly informed about the area. On top of everything else they keep a sales staff there to try to sell you a "travel club" using high pressure techniques and lying. Avoid this like the plague.,JoanBW
UR139280327,2012-3-September,Booked (AND PAID FOR) A two bedroom but upon arrival I was told that we were getting a one bedroom - that was all they had available. For three adults and two children! The issue has not been resolved. Parking is horrible front desk staff is RUDE and didn't care about the fact that a one bedroom wasn't going to work. To make matters worse - the check in process took 35 minutes and we were the only ones checking in. They send you to get "pool bracelets" but truthfully this is just to give you their sales pitch. Rooms basically suck. The bed is like a slab of cement. No mirrors and not clean. The elevator was broke down and we were staying on the fourth floor. Hallways are filthy. I honestly feel that what they did to us should be against the law. They are dirty crooks.,Olivia500
UR138359768,2012-25-August,We stayed at a resort in Orlando and chose grand seas resort for our 2 nd week . On arrival we found this to appear not a five star resort. exterior looked like a motel. I nearly fell through the railings in the car park on to the beach.on check in all paper work given was A photo copy (not what you would expect from a five star establishment)the resort felt run down.we checked in and checked out all within 1 hour. We didn't even get as far as the room. The rating system is guide to hotel quality I feel we have been miss lead. We rebooked into our original resort.,allangroom78
UR123522669,2012-23-January,This hotel should be avoided. I do not even know where to start! The room was very dirty. We complained about the bugs we were told we could spend $30 to have the room cleaned. There was a pill capsule on the kitchen window sill that we repeatedly asked to have removed. We threw the pill away after two weeks. Furniture is extremely worn. Constant phone messages to sell some type of cruise program. We empty our own grabage and took our towel to the laundry daily. When we turned bathroom light on in middle of night you could watch bugs scatter. Main desk staff was polite but really did not want to hear complaints. None of the employees seemed happy and absolutely no one said hello or good morning unless spoken to first. The only plus was the Grille located in the hotel. The wait staff in the Grille was very friendly and helpful. We were unfortunately at this hotel not a resort by any standard for two weeks. We will not go back!!!!,BohanDonner
UR124826895,2012-19-February,Room smelled so strongly of bleach that it burned your nose hairs. Poor lighting at night. Front desk treated us like criminals when our room key would not work. Would never go back. There were also roaches. No security.,shannon s
UR130161968,2012-18-May,Just like some of the interviews which gave the true description of the Grand Seas Resort in Daytona Beach we were highly disappointed. This was my first time using Interval. I am going to write this company a letter asking if they ever do check out these places at all? The pictures in the catalog we viewed looked so good but the reality was totally different. Not only no balconies but no screens either on any of the windows and they were dirty. When looking up from the pool people had their windows open and the drapes were blown outside by the breeze because of no screen. Very tacky looked like a real 'seedy' place from below. It looks like it has not been renovated since at least 1950 with old old appliances the stove was rusty in parts one burner was broken and did not work and the oven had not been cleaned in a very long time the floor molding was coming off and rusted at the corners a bad uncomfortable mattress pad on the small Murphy bed. On and the bathroom had one small mirror and no mirrors at all in the room. I would never use that bathtub as a jacuzzi spa. The vents were black looked dirty. I wish I had looked on this site of trip advisor before I booked. And those who said this so-called resort was great either do not expect anything at all or must work for this resort in some capacity. The only saving grace was the beautiful view of the ocean nice flat screen TV and the small restaurant/bar attached was okay and the food quite nice and reasonably priced. But all in all it will go down as 1 on a scale from 2 to 10; 10 being best. I hope we never have to experience a dumpy place like this again. In the paperwork I had there was a fee to change rooms. As I peeked inside at other rooms when in passing I saw that they looked pretty much the same. SHAME ON YOU INTERVAL for not taking better care of your members (who pay huge $$$$s to belong to your membership) in this time share!,Paula F
UR137102802,2012-13-August,One year it is fine this year it was a huge disaster. Floors filthy all along walls Cherry stems and pits out in the open fridge and dishwasher rusted on the inside. Sales asks what problems you are having and then say we do not want to hear that just stop talking. Only saving grace this week was the front desk. Everyone else just does not give a damn and should be fired.,Mlevis
UR127583578,2012-10-April,We recently spent a week at the Grand Seas resort in Daytona and found the place in need of renovation. Peeling chipped paint stained tile grout rusting appliances rusting around elevator doors furniture in poor shape even stained plastic toilet seats. The location is great on the beach with shopping right across the street but just no where near the premier resort advertised. Ours was a timeshare trade through Interval International and we were very disappointed that Interval even continues to list this as an eqivalent exchange with our home resort. Just not up to the standards we've come to expect in an interval exchange. Also resented that they had no chairs or boogie boards to take onto the beach. We could rent chairs for $35 a day or a boogie board for $15. I went across the street and bought a boogie board for $12. The staff was good but the place needs to be renovated and they should have a few chairs and toys to lend.,selake92
UR107485769,2011-9-May,bar tender at the pool was very rude some staff are rude. they try to sell time share but they present themselves very poorly. certainly not worth the money spend to stay there. think twice before u go.,Rooma2000
UR116455580,2011-9-August,We are a family of 5 and we stayed at the Grand seas for 5 nights during the first week of August 2011. The Good: Great facility love the suite( 2020)we were In nice indoor and outdoor pool Nice appliances The Bad: Rooms are cleaned once a week Wireless network never worked TV in the master suite is old makes a lot of noise when turn on. Overall it is not such a terrible place but the sanitary condition has to be better than what is offered. I have never stayed at an hotel or resort where the rooms are cleaned only once a week. We needed fresh towels and sheets we were told to go and get them ourselves and that is unacceptable. We are living in a technological era and many of us rely on Wireless Network to do if not all but some daily tasks with our wireless devices even when we are a vacation. The wireless network was nightmare. We paid a daily fee of $3 for something that never worked...shame shame shame... My advice to Grand Seas personnel is to take all the guesses' complaints into consideration. I am sure others had complaints about similar issues however it is very clear that little has done to improve on the satisfaction of the guesses otherwise i would not be writing about these issues. it is all about cashing in. I will not say I will never be back. I have to be back to check on the improvement of the Grand Seas. Once I am satisfied i can spread the good words.,prevail40
UR116447259,2011-8-August,My beef is that I own that the Grand Seas in Daytona. They only sold a limited amount of Club Navigo time Shares there. Let me tell you Grand Seas will not pay the Club Navigo Fees. So I had to wait one year to get a week deposited with II. Now I pay Club Navigo directly for the club fees BUT I am being charged late fees by the Grand Seas and still I have NO week of time share! So whether they get you up front or on the back end neither of these companies are upright. It took a complaint from me to the BBB of Florida to get a mere $139 payment made that was held hostage. Let me tell you there were many unreturned phone calls and emails. I do own a timeshare with Sheridan (Starwood) and it is a joy to work with these companies. They go out of their way to help! Now I am being held hostage AGAIN by Grand Seas and Club Navigo over $45 late fees of which neither will help me resolve. Sure sucks to take a vacation sometimes.,clubhill
UR118984022,2011-5-October,I read all the reviews but since we were meeting friends and Daytona was in the middle for us we used our points froma time share and booked at Grand Seas. This was the only place we could get on the Florida coast through them. It was billed as a 5 star resort and we were use to quality stays with our time share. This really wasn't even a 3 star. Let me list the problems with the room first: No light bulb in a sofa lamp the stripping on the bottom of the shower door was hanging by one corner several wands to open and shut the curtains were missing the toaster didn't work the fridge had no light the kitchen had ants the sound for the TV in the master bedroom took awhile to warm up the 1st room we tried didn't have internet(it was too far from the server) the curtains for the bedroom on the hall were louvered and let in too much light in the master bath there were no towel racks by the bathroom sink nor were there any hooks the shower pressure was very weak the mattresses were poor and to top it off there was no DVD player. We had trouble getting a 2nd parking pass even though we had a 2 bedroom and were two families. We understood one pass per unit but we had originally had 2 one bedrooms and we had switched when we got there. The restaurant on site was nice. They had a breakfast special; 2 eggs 2 bacon 2 sausage 2 pancakes for $3.75. The people in the restaurant got to know you and they were fun. Now.... when you talk about the pool area and ocean the set up was the best I've seen. There were two large outdoor pools one with a slide a circular kiddie pool with a small slide and an indoor pool. The pool chairs were very cheap plastic and did crack easily but there were enough of them and they also had tables with umbrellas. They had a bar in the middle and even tho we didn't use it it was nice. The ocean was right there. Boom! Down the steps and put out your chair. I had a great time. It was my best best beach trip ever. I liked this pool and beach set up better than any place I've stayed in Sanibel Sarasota Pensacola and Panama City Beach. Take what I've said and decide what you need and go from there. For us even tho the room was bad we had one of the best vacations ever. (And the part about wear shoes and socks is so true.) I ruined one pair of socks just by walking around the condo.,Nanalee5050
UR101630474,2011-26-March,Was invited to take part in a tour and told about several freebies that would be received after the tour. Went in waited and then told that because of our address and driver's license we were not the type of people they wanted for their tours. We were given a $20 gift card to replace the $20 we provided the day before to hold our spot for the tour. After asking for further explaination nothing better was given other than we were in the wrong "color scheme" that they place everyone in. What in the world?!? Have gone to time share things in the past and this was horrible! Will be reporting them everywhere we can! The place in no where near 5 star and not even in the best beach location! Run down nasty looking once you get past the lobby. I would never recommend this place to anyone! Choose Motel 8 before this place!,SusannPatrick
UR115792888,2011-26-July,We stayed here for a week with our 17 year old daughter who slept on pull-out couch in main area. We all really enjoyed the 2 large comfortable clean pools and outdoor jacuzzis. The outdoor bar was good with drink specials and a good lunch/snack menu at reasonable prices. Access to the beach was great and the Daytona area was really enjoyable. Room layout was not fantastic but certainly adequate especially for a beach resort. From 8 am to 9 pm the facility was great. A terrible and cruel transformation occurred at night however which is a true deal-breaker. We have never slept in accommodations which were so uncomfortable and that includes several college dorm rooms that I have slept in as a high school counselor! The beds had very thin and rigid mattresses and we were forced to use the comforter as a matress pad under our sheets AND we had to purchase two egg crate matress supports for each bed (4 total). Additionally the main bedroom window faced the exterior hallway and was directky lit by 2 high-beam lights which illuminated the bedroom to afternoon brightness all night long. It was possible to read without turning on any lights in the room ALL NIGHT LONG. Even though wevtruly did have a fun 6-day vacation we were never so grateful to get home to our own beds! Would love to go back for the facility but couldn't take a week of tortuted sleep. :(,Spikesgirl87
UR109653350,2011-24-May,Definitely not a 5-star as Interval Intntl has it listed. The inside was dirty outdated no balconies at all furnishings old and stained very small rooms towels felt like rough sandpaper and very thin. The outside was much better on the beach nice pools and good play areas for children...but we had no children with us. Nice location with shopping plaza across the street.,MKAT2011
UR122033931,2011-23-December,Looking at their web site the property appeared very nice. This appearance was far from the truth. We had a two bedroom unit which was small and uncomfortable. A small table attached to the wall was all we could eat from. There were bugs all over the place requiring the pest control company to come and rectify. The kitchen was dirty with some of the appliances not working. We were on the ground floor which had the advantage of having a patio adjacent to the children's play area. The upper floors have no balcony. The second bedroom which was not en-suite was against the walkway to the car park and as people started walking by with their baggage as early as 4.30 a.m. it was impossible to get a good night's sleep. The front desk staff tried their best to help but to no avail. It appeared that the cleaners did not clean beneath anything nor above eye level. Although we had two rooms we were only allowed one parking place. Our recommendation is "Stay away at all costs".,Ian H
UR114624353,2011-21-June,My wife granddaughter daughter and I stayed at this resort for seven nights. This was a terrible place to stay. They charged $3.00 per day for internet coffee and a paper. I was able to get a signal three times in the whole week never did get a paper. Twice I went down for a cup of coffee once the coffee pot was empty the other time it was very cold. At first they tried to put me in a room that didnt have any bedroom windows and the front faced the parking lot. In addition the side faced a busy street. I gave up a Five Star resort on Marco Island for this dump (thank you Interval International). I went to the front desk and nicely told the manager that the room and location was unacceptable and was not going to work. The manager searched the inventory and found us an ocean front room on the 5th floor. Although we were going to have to move on Saturday night; I could deal with moving one night. The front desk staff was very helpful in trying to accommodate us. When I went down stairs to discuss the non-connect ability of the internet the front desk staff was apologetic. Our two bedrooms were sold to us as having a full-kitchen. I attached a photo of the kitchen. What a joke!! There was no place to store food; you couldnt even fit the silverware and holder in the drawer. My home resort had a washer and dryer in the unit the washer at this resort cost $1.75 and dryer was $1.50 a load. There was no change machine. I went to the front desk for change and they couldnt provide any change. The front desk told me to go to the restaurant next door and I did. However the restaurant couldnt provide any change either. The least this resort could have done was to provide free washer and dryer to their guest. If they felt the need to charge for the machines there should have been some means of breaking a dollar of five dollar bill. The master shower was nasty. When you walked on the floors your socks turned black. They had a nice flat screen TV although there was no DVD. There was a desk in the lobby that staffed a few ladies that kept trying to get us to take a tour and join their vacation club; we didnt want anything to do with it. The resort needed a total renovation and actually would do best just to tear it down and build something new. The location on the beach was nice but that was it. On a final note the parking lot was stupid as well.,Menden1
UR114526114,2011-20-June,This place lies and is a total rip off. Do not stay here. They literally ruined me and my family and friends vacation. I stayed here because they said they could promise me a ocean side room with a balcony and they had free wireless internet. Plus they have a restaurant attached that will deliver like room service. We got there and immediately came the first lie. They do not have balcony's. They were taken off by the hurricanes and never replaced. Than at the end of our stay we had a 33 dollar charge. Why? a 10 DOLLAR charge for delivering food. We had already given the kid a 10 dollar tip but they still charged us to ride the elevator up two floors to our room? Than a 3 dollar room charge A DAY. When we asked what the charge was for they said wireless internet. THEY ADVERTISED IT WAS FREE! Than to top it all off my parents attended a meeting on this time share type thing. It was 9000 dollars to buy into it and it gave you discounted rooms. The guy selling it claimed to be a travelling salesperson and claimed he lived on a beach and owned 3 vacation homes through this company and said how much he LOVED to be a salesman. When we ate dinner two evenings after that at the in resort restaurant he served us our food as A WAITER! so once again don't stay here!,Sarah22703
UR121917243,2011-20-December,I am sitting in my 5 star resort room right now. Its nasty. The floors are gritty we are on the 5th floor. The couch is stained the corners are dirty and there are tiny ants in the kitchen. The kitchen is set up horribly and the overall feel of the room is dirty. There is long white hairs everywhere and dark hairs in the tubs. I LOVE the resturant. The man that works down there is so friendly and is really good with the kids. Nothing looks like the pictures. The beach is covered in seaweed and my 3 and 5 year old were stung by man o wars right outside on the beach yesterday. I asked the lobby what it was that stung them and they had no idea. I had to take them to the ER and have them treated then had to tell the lobby what it was that did the stinging. Treating a man o war sting as a jelly fish sting can be lethal. I just don't like being lied to when we are driving all the way from Michigan and then get here and its nothing like they said. I am very thankful though that there were not roachs and the beach is beautiful. Overall we are making due because apparently being a member of the timeshare for 20 years gets you crappy condos but I will say this I hope they get their acts together and stop lying so people can actually enjoy their trips instead of being upset about them.,Megan H
UR96927098,2011-16-February,We stayed at this location in February 2011. I was embarrassed that we invited another couple to join us for part of the week. We are owners of Marriott properties and have exchanged to several other properties but have never encountered a location that was this run down. The front lobby gives a beautiful appearance; however the rooms and bathrooms were very old style. Grout was very dirty on the tile floor it appeared that it was original 40's or 50's formica on the countertops. Dishwasher and kitchen were limited. Bathroom tile was dirty and there was crumbling dry wall areas in the bathroom from dampness. It appears to be a converted motel. Looks like it needs to be torn down. Beach was fine and view gorgeous but please be aware that it's less than pristine!,mkb048
UR96805082,2011-15-February,I stayed at The Grand Seas Resort with 5 families for the weekend back in October 2010. We have a very large family and had to plan for several months to get all of us together in one place at one time. My sister in-law went to the property first to check it out. She was shown "renovated/remodeled" rooms and was told that we would all have similair rooms like shown. My husband and I arrived first. The front desk staff (two very young women) were unfriendly and bordered on rude. Once we reached our room on the 3rd floor it was evident that this was in no way a remodeled room. It was clean (for the 1st night) but looked very shabby. The bathroom showed cracked tiles and worn off paint in some places. As other family members arrived they had the same type of rooms. One room the door would not lock properly the new room then had a broken air conditioner. Another family had a roach in their room! Even though these family members got new rooms all the rooms still showed lots of ware and tear. The 2nd night of our stay I went to move a piece of luggage in the bedroom and had a huge roach crawl out from beneath it. Later that night I opened the cabinet in the kitchen only to find another roach. I find this unacceptible for ANY hotel! On the positive side the location is right on the beach and they have severaI pools inside and outside that are very nice. Unfortunately I still wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone for any reason!,LiveLife72
UR113479281,2011-14-June,This hotel had more bed bugs than people. People were rude.Will NEVER stay there again. Do not waste your MONEY here!!!,wedsa
UR118034491,2011-12-September,Stayed first week of September 2011 in room 2046. Looks partially refurbed new paint refaced cabinets new bed covers etc. No DVD player (really!!) and no WiFi. There was an alarm system in the room and signs everywhere about the CCTVs. Apparently theft is a serious problem. The floor was filthy there were ants in the kitchen and I killed a giant cockroach in the bathroom the second night and in the bedroom the fourth night. This is the first time I have stayed somewhere where I bought Lysol to clean and disinfect the place MYSELF. I figured there would be no point to asking them to clean since they apparently do not know how. The bathmat had mold on it and so did the shower curtain (see photos)- had to use Lysol just to get in the tub. Mold in the jets on the side of the tub- did not even consider using the whirlpool- gross. First day had to call maint. to fix the fridge (blown fuse). Responded quickly and fixed it but when I asked him to fix the bedroom closet door he just pulled on the door to realign it. The screws could be seen coming out but apparently it was not an option to fix it then. Three or four days later it popped back out. The reason I gave two stars instead of one was the staff and the beach access. View was fantastic. Staff were great always a smile and a hello helpful pleasant. The beach was great not crowded like the places on either side of us can see it from the pool; (did not get in the pool since I had doubts about the cleanliness but still a cool feature-looked clean tho. Decent landscaping. If they could just get the property up to par (really just clean the room and hire pest control already). Now just in case someone from their management comes on and says "if only you had informed us..." I shouldn't have to tell you your place is not clean hire someone to do spot checks isn't there a supervisor for the cleaning staff checking on their work? The fridge-yes the door-yes cleaning-no I will not advise you. I should have told them abut the non working remote for the tv in the bedroom but I did not want to be bothered by the time I realized it. Food at Gilligan's was decent. Unlike Prevail40 I will NOT be back...,Travel_Lovers_YB
UR120499039,2011-12-November,Very uncomfortable murphy bed only! 10am checkout; you are charged for an extra night after 11am. Internet is in the lobby only. Poorly maintained property. On the plus side the hotel is right on the beach.,ashi88
UR85507504,2010-31-October,A 5 star resort! Not. Check out the photos. Walked into these cock roaches the first night. They continued all week long. One crawled up my pajamas standing right outside the door. The 2nd bedroom had a dorm refrigerator that kicked off and on all night long. The plantation shutters did not meet either side of the window which caused extreme brightness. The pools and the outside were fantastic as well as the restaurant Giligans! The rooms however need extreme makeovers! No balconies either! The third photo is the couch which we had to cover in towels and blankets.,cgree53488
UR62395513,2010-25-April,We traded our Marriott timeshare unit through Interval International for a week in this resort because it was rated by Interval as a five-star resort. We feel that Interval misled us and that we have been cheated. THIS IS NOT A FIVE-STAR RESORT. The furniture was cheap and soiled the mattress hard the sheets and towels worn and scratchy the bathtub dingy the toilet miniature the kitchen appliances outdated and raggety (not one level burner out of four) the kitchen cabinets would not stay closed no balcony the hallway dingy no major network TV no DVD or equivalent and (at the risk of appearing snobby) the appearance of some of the other vacationers at this resort made us queasy imagining the former occupants of the unit we were occupying. The beach is gorgeous but the resort itself is very disappointing and we would have been motified if we had invited another couple to join us on our vacation.,h2rwllc
UR56136732,2010-16-February,It has been almost a year since our trip and I have not quite recovered from my disappointment. I am somewhat local to the area so I had an idea of the property which has a nice layout and convenient location across the street from a Starbucks and Publix. I wasn't prepared for the roaches (small brown ones) every day...in the kitchen. The pool was unbelievably grimy. I understand everyone is wearing sunscreen etc. but how do other properties do it? We've done quite a bit of traveling. The rooms have a decent layout but with no balcony we were stuck inside while our son was sleeping. We were bored to tears and could barely use the kitchen without stumbling upon roach feces. Restaurants were decent and the activities planned were fun. Nice playground and putt putt course. Another frustrating thing happened - the lawn service came in the middle of the day and one of the workers actually asked me to get up from where I was laying in a chair and move the chair along with all my belongings next to it so he could get to the small patch of grass behind me. I thought he was joking but he waited with the hand-held gas-emitting weed whacker while I moved everything. Oh one more thing - all day and night you would hear people dragging their chairs against the tile floor. By the end of the trip (we left a day early) it reminded us of nails on a chalkboard. Little rubber or felt buttons would resolve this - we didn't complain about it but I can't imagine someone else hasn't. The best part of the trip was taking a ride to Ponce Inlet and touring the sweet Lighthouse attraction - then walking along the boardwalk (which requires a nominal fee to enter.) Also discovering Noah's Market in Ormond Beach was a huge plus.,MHDom
UR79250041,2010-12-September,My title should say it all...I stayed there for a Labor Day vacation. On the first day the floors were so dirty that my son's feet were black on the bottom after only playing for 1 hour! The second night while sleeping in the bed I was awakened at 11 pm by a roach crawling up my arm and a huge palmetto bug was also on the floor-2 different kind of bugs!! They moved us to a different room but who could sleep after that! I called Interval International the next morning and had them move us to a better resort 10 miles away. The bathroom was moldy the ceilings were peeling and there is not enough parking with no lights in the "south" lot at night. After our traumatic ordeal we were "compensated" with $20 gift certificates to the restaurant-like after seeing roaches in the bedroom would make me want to eat at the restaurant. The pools and oceanfront location is nice the only plus. The whole resort needs to be torn down and rebuilt. For those that stay at Motel 6 Econolodge or Super 8 motels this may be a nice place but it is definitely NOT a 5 star resort!!,gpulliam
UR63746945,2010-10-May,The location on the beach is excellent and the pool area is nice but this is far from a five star or gold medal resort. The condo was dirty wear slippers if you don't want black feet. There was dirt in the window sills on the floor in the kitchen - we even had a cockroach. The towels are skimpy and getting threadbare. The sofa was stained and there were no screens on the windows. The kitchen is minature and quality of plates and utensils was poor with chips in the bowls. This appears to be one of the few resorts on the beach without balconies. Keep searching for another location and skip this resort.,DenverTravelqeen
UR31907440,2009-8-June,The Grand Seas was built around 1954. Hopefully they will soon get around to renovating it !!!!!!!! This facility is NOT a FIVE STAR it wouldn't qualify as a Five Star in Bosnia! We felt they must have renovated it when they converted it to a timeshare. and wouldn't have a daily rate of $209 per night unless it could be justified. We were wrong the only modification we could find was the removal of the ocean front balconies. The room was nasty down to the furniture and even after cleaning it remained filthy (they cleaned around everything including the dirt evidently). There is virtually no parking dozens of hidden fees and charges on top of the $209 per night and our room had not 1 but 2 broken Microwaves. The hotel had more restrictions than GITMO you had to wear an arm band to even be on the pool deck and if you didn't return it at check out there was a $15.00 fee. You even had to rent towels at the pool for $10 each every time you needed one. Our room keys had to be recoded at least 7 times in 3 days so we spent a lot of time in the front office. They were lots of guests making complaints every time we were there. We were given a "free" night for attending their timeshare presentation. We endured 90 minutes of sales puffery only to find that at checkout they charged us an additional $209 for the night and only the manager could reverse the charge and she would not be available until 2 hours after checkout time. We were given the option of waiting 2 hours or we could leave and they would call us when the credit was processed. (They didn't call I had to call them 4 hours later request the manager and explain the entire situation ( evidently no one had even told her about it.) I was told the credit would be processed within 48 hours and to check back to verify. As a final affront there is a $100.00 per hour charge for checking out after the 10 am check out time. IN 40 years of travelling I have never heard of such a thing. My advice ....... take the time you would waste fixing broken crap avoiding sitting on nasty furniture and reading fine print and spend it finding a real 4 or 5 star hotel to spend your vacation in.,blingbob
UR48498785,2009-4-November,This is NOT a five-star resort! We came because it's rated as a five-star and we were very very disappointed. The units are dated the bathrooms need re-doing (there were signs of mould around the bathtub & baseboards were old and not finished well) towels were hard & scratchy furniture in unit was cheap very few balconies units do not have kettles elevators old dirty & smelly hallways dingy steps need painting,kelrich
UR36596801,2009-3-August,We were bumped from the hotel we thought we reserved and sent to this place. The Good - it was on the ocean and the beach was not crowded. Only residents could use the pool - wristbands were required. The rooms are ok. The bad - the remotes didn't match the TV's. The remotes looked as if they'd been dragged across the floor several thousand times and the backs would not stay on. The toilet in our bedroom would run on from time to time. The windows had no screens. And the the ugly - the exterior only entrances were always wet dank potmarked and the elevator took forever. The pools were cleaned daily so we went to the pool to the beach and out to eat. We went basically to rest but I would not have picked this place.,GA2go
UR50079518,2009-25-November,We also were taken in by this resort's 5-star rating only to be terribly disappointed and to wonder how on earth they hold such a rating. The sofa and chairs in the living room were disgustingly filthy; the pool towels they make you sign out are small thin & cheesy; the dishwasher sounded like it's on it's last legs; the wall in the 2nd bedroom was spotted and dirty. The only thing this place has going for it is that it is located right on beautiful Daytona Beach.,mac4747
UR25098975,2009-24-February,Grand Seas is not a very nice hotel. The rooms are in desperate need of remodeling and the room was not very clean upon check-in. The floors were dirty and sandy when we got there. The outdoor pools are not heated so if you are going during the winter they are cold! My 2 year-old wouldn't even swim in them! One of the two outdoor hot tubs was broken and everything just seems old dirty and out-dated. On a postive note it is a good location across from the shopping center and on the beach. Though driving on the beach is ridiculous esp if you have small children and you have to make sure they are not going to get run over by a car on the beach! NOT AT ALL RELAXING.,mare0
UR30545841,2009-22-May,Oh wow where to start...first off the 5 star rating? HAHA did they give that to themselves? 2 at tops! Upon arriving ther is no one to take your luggage or valet your vehicle...staff up front was courteous that was the only good thing...after getting my room keys i was sent all the way across the hotel to find a luggage cart myself....keep in mind all hallways and rooms are outdoors so the carrts were rusted....got my luggage hoping to make it to the room and relax...but when u have anxiety and get stuck in the elevator on the way to your room!!!!! its not sooo relaxingg...elevators were tiny rusted aluminum with smelly wet carpet and fit for about 3 ppl tops!! soo being stuck in that was no fun....anyways after a few minutes it started to move and i made it to floor 6 stumbled out trying to catch my breath again and made my way to the room....ok soo i walked in and the tile was freshly mopped...welll upon going into the bedroom i found out there are no jacuzzi tubs in the room itself like they falsely advertise on their website so i went in the bathroom...no tub there either just a shower!! soo i call the desk and tell them and they tell me i have been put in a handicapped room!! they moved me to the 2nd floor promising a jacuzzi tub....lugged my stuff downstairs instead of using the elevator....walked in the room and couldnt breathe because it smelled sooo terrible!! wtf is wrong with this place!? that was the last straw...soo i went downstairs demanded a refund and made reservations at the shores resort down the road where i have stayed before....i told them that grand seas called themself 5 stars and they just laughed reassuring me they were the nicest hotel in daytona and promptly giving me a room at a discounted rate :)....soo if you are thinking of staying here i would strongly recommend the shores...it costs a little more but SOOOO well worth it!! this place by far has nooo right to call themselves a resort!,tankbeatz
UR38412451,2009-21-August,I am not surprised at all to come here and see so many horrible reviews. We stayed here for a week on our honeymoon. The hotel staff were sooooo rude! I don't even know how this place sells rooms they should be shut down or someone should buy this place and get new customer service staff! The room was a nice size but the couch was hard and uncomfortable there was no balcony and the windows in both the living room and bedroom only had small openings. The bed was so hard neither my husband or I got much sleep the entire week. On the last day of staying there the hotel front desk staff was so rude I actually yelled at the lady to shut her mouth and just check us out because I wanted far far away from that place. I am a very nice person and never raise my voice but enough was enough! There was a girl who was like a customer service manager or something off to the right and she came up and asked us to tell her what was wrong so she could "right" the situation. She was very nice and did give us a complimentary breakfast and money to use in the gift shop but that was the first day she was there the entire week and by that time.. a free breakfast didn't do anything to console us. Please save your money and go elsewhere!!,Mom2aJellybean
UR35242325,2009-20-July,We are owners through Club Navigo and thouht we would give this place 1 more chance we had stayed here 2 yrs ago and had the worst 10 days of a vacation. I requested a 1st floor room due to have a foot injury and couldnt due alot of walking I called the resort several times through the months when we arrived we were given a room as far as the rooms go so much for my foot! As I arrived the first thing I had to do was sign up for the internet which was 50 bucks for the WEEK!!! I see mom and pop places all down the beach and its free.So I eat the cost sign up and 2 days later im watching Tv on computer and internet goes out I call them they tell me they dumped the company and are looking for another company in the mean time Im out my money and its my responsibilty to get a refund from some local guy who wont pick up his phone.WE seen several Florida Cockroaches in our room which scared my girlfriends to death! I called all week no one came down to spray!!! Ive been to several timeshares and they always have activities everday this place had to afternoons for 1 hr thats it no games nothing at the pool those activievies girls are to busy calling your room trying to get you to take a tour. I just told someone today on the beach if I was given 100.00 bucks to give to someone who had a smile on there face or said hello I dont think I could fine someone at this plae they are the rudest people Ive ever dealt with before.I seen on the news the unemployment rate is 10% how can people have a job!! I had to call around to move hotels since no internet I found a lovely place to stay our second week which welcomed us at 10am so we were not without a room all day Ive never seen such friendly people at this resort and its awesome. Dont consider the Grand Seas unless your just desperate or stupid like us for buying the timeshare.Im glad we have lots of options to go elsewhere,gwgw98
UR42415087,2009-17-September,This place is horrible. The tiny room with the flimsy bed that pulled down from the wall. The room was dirty and had bugs. The room had a nice view of the ocean; it would have been nice to have a private patio to sit on. The staff was friendly but not very helpful. There is no way this place could be rated as 5 stars. The correct rating is 1 or 2 stars. Pennsylvania,JEMPennsylvania
UR49084270,2009-12-November,I found staying there to be most disappointing. My issues: (1) Our first premonition was the extremely rusted exterior face on the electronic door lock which housed the slide card technology. (2) Upon entry we were greeted by an overwhelming smell of bleach/ammonia. Open all doors and windows and -- lets check the bedroom. Small but adequate. We are not large people. (3)Incidentally the length of the bed is 73" so I hope you are used to the fetal position or intend to spoon with your mate - all night. Oh by the way dont plan on watching TV using the remote. (4)The AA batteries are dead. Fortunately It can be used manually. You know one of the good things about getting older is that your hearing is on the slide. You will now appreciate this with (5)the toilet running every 5". And speaking of toilets - women please skip to #6 you will probably be surprised and maybe flattered to (6)notice that your best friend is also taking a cold dip when you sit on the kiddie toilet with its very low seat and high water level. Ill bet they got a really good buy on those. Seeing what was in the bedroom was challengingas you learn how to use the TVs manual controls. Why you may ask. Answer-- (7)the one and only lamp in the room coincidentally has no light bulb. Well you are thinking Ill get on the internet and check my email weather whatever. Surprise surprise. This 5-star rated resort also has (8)no room internet access. Actaully that is not entirely true. There is one ethernet cable in the central game room - for the entire guest population at the Grand Seas. There are 2 wireless with security available however. Good luck with that one. The desk staff stated on Sunday that it would be up by Wed. Today is Thursday. A call to the front desk set me straight. I was informed that as they are between carriers they cant say as to a time or date. They dont have a hint! Lets get out of our little home away from home and find some things positive. How a about a soak in the spa - after a long day climbing the lighthouse tower and whatever it ought to feel great. (9) Hope that 109 degrees is not too hot cause if it is dont look to the help on duty if its after 5PM. Its really no problem. I already hot enough. Tom,tomlindaschulte
UR15827327,2008-9-May,The rooms are nice the resturant Rosario's Ristorante is wonderful (which Grand seas doesn't own) But the front desk girls are horrible. I mean the worst attiudes I have ever seen. Not friendly not helpful. And the little Manager girl during the day THE WORST. Therefore Grand Seas is nice and relaxing to stay at but I would advise them to get a new staff.,sam3693
UR19764217,2008-4-September,The worse place in America. The resort had rodents moles broken kitchen cabinets no non-smoking rooms the jucuzy had dirt coming out of the jets mixed with hair. The nastiest place i ever stayed in my life. And to make matters worse the manager said we are swimming at our own risk they are not responsible for theft of personal items in our rooms and not responsible for our vehicle in their car park. The car park was dark because of turtle season which is March to November. People are scalling their walls to use their pools and ALL their cameras were not working at the time of our stay. Evey morning we will meet guests in their only working elevator complaining about items being stolen out of their rooms. The resort takes responsibility for nothing. Is this the USA or IRAQ? PLEASE GRAND SEAS CLEAN UP YOUR ACT. Yet still they are refered to as a 5 star resort. Please try super 8 at least you will get what you paid for.,abimontreal
UR14697104,2008-31-March,Sorry to say but I never stayed at the Grand Seas Hotel. But just by reading all the horrible reviews on The Grand Seas I would NEVER recomond this hotel to anybody not even to people who I didn't even know!! :(( And a little advice to The Grand Seas hotel you better clean up your Hotel or you will have no visitors!! :(,mommy01
UR12892318,2008-22-January,I had planned a trip to Daytona for Bike Week 5 - 9 March 08. I contacted Grand Seas Club Navigo to reserve a 2 bedroom for 4 days. I was told the dates weren't available yet the March 08 dates would be released on 1 February 08 but I could deposit $99 to allow me to get the dates & rooms I wanted. I agreed & then found out it was a BIG LIE!!! The Customer Service Representative (Lisa) told me that I never requested those dates & I should take my vacation on different dates in order not to loose my deposit. It was shocking to basically being called a liar... I asked when does a hotel tell a customer what dates they should vacation. I am still FURIOUS with all of this I just want my deposit returned don't want a upgrade or anything from them. I am warning anyone not to make reservation with false pretense that you change it for a later date. I DO NOT want to stay at any of Club Navigo establishments if this is what they consider Customer Service...,VLCal
UR13684115,2008-19-February,JUST AWFUL RUN. This place is beyond terrible. This property was a very old motel which has been convert to "timeshares." They created 1 new unit with 2 motel rooms. The place is OLD and DIRTY and has furniture that appears to be 20-30 years old. It is worn and dirty as are the appliances counter tops and bathrooms. The corners of all rooms have never been cleaned properly. I was shown a model room which was very nice. New everything and sparkling clean. Thats where the cleaniness ends in the model. The pool areas are nice as is the looby and snack bar. EVERYTHING ELSE IS DISGUSTING. All common areas walkways stairs elevators and parking lots are in need of replacement. I really feel sorry for the buyers.,line10
UR19073745,2008-18-August,I stayed at the Grand Seas Resort from August 9 - 16 2008. We booked our room through Interval International as a trade on our time share. Interval rated it as 5 stars...I wouldn't give it even 1 star. The Grand Seas is by far the worst place I have ever stayed. To say it is filthy would be kind. Apparently the management thinks that putting a fresh coat of paint on the walls would mask the filth everywhere else. Where should I begin...with the mold in the shower the 1/2 inch thick dust between the bed and nightstands the stains on the carpet the dirt that has accumulated for what must be years in the corners of every floor the peeling paint on the kitchen cabinets the peeling paint on the ceilings the furniture from 30 years ago the windows that were marked with fingerprints and food from previous occupants the mop strings that were clogging the kitchen sink drain and dishwasher that was shoved in under the kitchen sink which lifted the countertop and made it slant the expired inspection sticker in the elevator which only worked periodically and when the elevator did work you had to stand in puddles of water on the floor of it. Oh and did I mention the stains and sticky stuff on the bedding??? The swimming pool always had a film floating on top of it and you couldn't even see your toes when you were in the water. What a total disaster this place is. Avoid this place at any cost even if they try to give it away free. It's the absolute pits.,palmtree123
UR18508314,2008-1-August,The good... Checked in on a Sunday. Front desk was very nice to us and answered our questions. Our room(5004) was nice there are no balconies but very large windows in living room and bed room. Our room was two bedrooms two bathrooms with shower and garden tub in master and shower/tub in second bathroom. living room kitchen and table for four. We saw dolphins twice daily 7:30 a.m. and 7:00 p.m. The first day there was 1 or 2. The third day there was about 6 or 7. There are 3 pools and 3 hot tubs one of each are indoors. Nothing was over crowded. They have a 9 hole miniature golf  we didn't use but saw several families talking advantage of it. Nice little fitness center game room gift shop and restaurant. we did not use. This hotel is on the FAR north end only a few shops. There is a Publix grocery store Quizno's and a Starbucks across the street and some other shops in the strip mall. The beach is beautiful and when we stepped on the sand it was the softest we had been on we just kept saying it. It was also VERY clean. The bad... Don't know how to put this so I will just throw it out there. They have a cockroach problem. I don't know if this is a territory thing with beaches? (never seen it before.) Monday went to the welcome reception for donuts and juice. Picked up a donut and a cockroach walked across the platter. We left without eating. I brushed it off as a fluke. The Thursday the day before we left the largest cockroach I have ever seen walked across the kitchen counter in our room. If we weren't leaving the next day I would have left. I can deal with bad grout cracked tile and chipped paint like others complained about but I draw the line at cockroaches. Next you have to pay to use their wireless internet. This should be included. 3 elevators that are really slow. I would love to stay here again but the bug problem needs to be addressed also this is a timeshare resort I would look into this before buying.,ndnuts2
UR7817689,2007-9-June,OK I had a 3 page review but decided to start over. Personally from my experience (and I have been around the world 3 times) I would save my money. 1. Sales Management: We were promised one thing and got a total different package. Read the fine print PLEASE. I will leave this story alone. (You do NOT stay at the Grand Seas with the $49.00 deal you stay at a partner dump). We just paid the full price and canceled. 2. Hotel: What engineer would design a beach hotel without a balcony? Why is this important? a. The pool bar closed at 6:30 Sat. night Memoial Day Weekend? The bar inside closed at 9:PM the same night. The resturant is only open 5pm-10pm and is $$$$ higher than Ruth Christ (Really). This FORCES you into your room. (Even the kids stated they could watch TV at home?) b. There are 2 5'X5' elevators. weather they passed expection or not is questionable but.........Take a family of 4 a cooler boogie board beach wear. So one family coming from the 6th floor basically has it to them self going down. Now take the fact that there is no service elevator and the employees must use it........One trip down took 15 minutes (I had no choice as I had the cooler) b. As stated parking. They may have 75 parking places problem is anyone who wants to go to the beach parks at the Grand Seas and hops the wall. After I was forced to park across the street I walked the parking lot and found exactly 11 cars with tags in the window. I informed Management and 2 hours later it was the same situation. (Or you can do like the Tiki Bar Manager and park your Yellow Porche directly in front of the front door all weekend?) Since cars could not drive past the front door get ready to walk to check in! c. As for the room ours was clean and we really had no complains with the exception of no balcony. (Oh Yea put 1 hour aside because they make you inventory EVERYTHING!!) #forks #spoons # pots #TV's #remots...........But the room was clean. I have seen some complaints about sand in the bath room...YOU ARE AT THE BEACH!!!! I was not feeling the tile floors but I could live with that. My suggestion: If your in your 70's retired and just looking to get away for your 50th year of marriage OK. If you have kids or looking for things other than a pool look elsewhere! To be fair I will not list them here but I personally know 3 places at Daytona that are cheaper and more "family" friendly. My last suggestion: Everyone and their mother is walking around trying to sell you a time share. Even directly in front of the Grand Seas. The first thing they all ask "Where are you from?" Tell them your from Daytona and they end the conversation!!!,dksims
UR6936366,2007-8-March,We do a lot of traveling and I rarely write hotel reviews of our stays but I feel strongly that those of you even THINKING about traveling to this resort should read this and RECONSIDER. I have never been to Daytona. I have never been to this resort. My family traded in a 5-star Paris Marriott timeshare for our week stay. A week alone to celebrate our anniversary. Booking was difficult as it is Spring Break time... so we got Daytona and this hotel. We were excited to explore the area and relax. Thanks to the Grand Seas and it's deplorable condition the week was an absolute nightmare and total waste of time and money. I'm not going to sling mud. I will just spew the facts and have the photos to prove. - Upon our Sunday arrival 2 of the 3 elevators were broken. We stayed on the extreme North of the hotel. Only the elevator on the extreme SOUTH was working so it wasn't worth it. Mind you the elevators were broken until Friday morning. 5 days of up- down up-down with laundry groceries and 40 pound suitcases. Not exactly the ideal way to begin a "relaxing vacation". - We realized in the middle of our first night when we were SWEATING to death from the Florida humidity that the A/C in our condo WASN'T WORKING. The next morning (Mon.) maintenance "fixed it". It once again stopped working in the middle of Mon. night. This pattern occurred the first FOUR DAYS of our stay until on Wednesday when it was 85 degrees according to our thermostat and HUMID AS HE** in our room management finally told us that we had to move units. They couldn't fix it. Would have been NICE to know that a few days earlier before we went to the grocery store or lost several night's sleep due to heat and humidity in our unit?! In addition HUGE pain re-packing and unpacking EVERYTHING including groceries. FIRST UNIT THAT WE STAYED IN (in ADDITION to the AC not working): Built-in Microwave didn't work so they had a SECOND one sitting on the counter. Toaster didn't function at all. Safe was not attached to the floor properly AND didn't function. Remote control for the TV didn't work. Tub was dirty and not draining properly. SECOND UNIT THAT WE STAYED IN: Tub AGAIN not draining properly. After several run-ins with maintenance that week who had proven to be idiotic and incapable my husband finally got fed up and found a plunger. He had the sheer delight and honor of removing enormous CLUMPS and CLUMPS of other people's hair so we didn't have to stand ankle-deep in funk every time we showered. If you opt to use the old jacuzzi... be aware THAT'S what you're soaking in. GROSS! Again the safe didn't work. The A/C of our NEW ROOM stopped working on THURSDAY NIGHT. By that point however were counting down the MINUTES to our Saturday check-out and didn't bother reporting it. No working TV remote. BOTH ROOMS: HORRIBLY FILTHY. And I am not talking a little. Scuffs on the walls. Film on the windows. Gunk on the baseboards. Paint chipping. Visible dirt on the bedspread. Not to mention ridiculously high internet charges (hello Starbucks across the street). Total rip off. THE WORST: If you are a guest here plan that every time your bare feet touch the tile floor... they will be black. Even a quick midnight run 4 feet to the bathroom. We heard SEVERAL other guests complaining about this. We finally bought a box of baby wipes to wipe our feet before getting into bed or putting on our shoes. AROUND THE RESORT: Obviously the elevators were an issue. Doors covered with rust and unmaintained. Roaches and cigarette butts a common sight in the corridors. The steps to the beach are flat-out DANGEROUS. Crumbling slippery total hazard. 1/2 of the laundry machines were broken. When we dried our clothes it took THREE CYCLES ($1.50 a pop) to get our clothes dry. The outdoor pool so cold there's NO way you could enter. One of the hot tubs SO hot seriously it's dangerous. The Tiki bar was never open. Nothing going on during the day or night minus a wine and cheese that was actually kind of fun. Plus the rooms don't have balconies?! This is like the ONLY hotel that doesn't have them in the area. Everyone just stands like prisoners looking out their windows. It's very odd?! OVERALL: If you are accustomed to Marriott (or ANY OTHER REPUTABLE HABITABLE hotel) quality do NOT come here. This resort is dirty unmaintained and is in need of a TOTAL overhaul. DO NOT ALLOW MARRIOTT TO PLACE YOU HERE AS A TRADE. YOU WILL BE APALLED BY THE QUALITY AND DEFERRED MAINTAINANCE. PLUS IF YOU WANT ANYTHING OTHER THAN A ROOM THE SIZE OF A CLOSET WITH A MURPHY BED... YOU WILL BE ASKED TO PAY FOR A $100 UPGRADE!! We talked to many guests. The only people HAPPY at the Grand Seas are those who seriously don't know better. This IS a nice hotel to them?! They have never been to a 4 or 5 star hotel. They will overlook dirt and grime and broken appliances. The management responses on this site are laughable. I have BEEN THERE and seen it for my OWN EYES. The only work being done while I was there was to the roof of the Tiki Bar thingie that WASN'T EVEN OPEN?! And mind you they blessed all of the guests with the BANGING of these repairs at 8:30 in the MORNING. Hope that you weren't planning to sleep-in guests?! A working elevator would have been nice instead?! ~roll eyes~ I feel as though when staying at a timeshare or hotel for that matter: appliances should work the rooms should be clean and guests should be comfortable. If you agree then PLEASE do NOT stay here. You will be extremely disappointed. The Grand Seas ensured that our anniversary getaway was stressful tiring and disappointing. If you have even a MINUTE amount of class or standard... avoid this money pit at ALL COSTS!!,Steve&Carrie
UR8030594,2007-30-June,On our most recent visit to the Grand Seas Resort it was less then perfect stay or vacation. Starting with check in we were told that we did not have a reservation on file by a very unfriendly unhelpful front desk employee. We were then told we had to call the 800 # for Club Navigo get the reservation information at that point we were sent to the Cove at Ormond Beach for the night. Giving us two rooms on two different floors. Which doesnt work well with a family of six of which four are under the age of ten. We didnt get things work out until almost 8PM that evening. Not a good start to a week long vacation. To top it all off we were forced out of the room at 10 AM before I was ever able figuring out why we didnt have a reservation? Next it was off to the Club Navigo sales office to work on my issue. Which continual to be an unpleasant experience the sale person helping me said he had fixed everything and to go over the hotel I would be set this was not the case. At this point I was get very upset again and had to return to the sales office. Final after 3 hours of getting the run around I had a conformation # and a room. By the way the reservation was in the system the whole time. This whole ordeal took up about a day and half of my vacation. Now this is when the fun begins first off the rooms look NOTHING like the model we were shown during our tour in December 2006. The kitchen was smaller then the model  stove not a full range like in the model. No walk through bathroom to the second bedroom like the model. No flat screen TVs like the model? Pictures missing off the walls. Air vents were rusting and the AC was leaking water all over the floor. Which had to be fix twice while we were there the over all cleanness of the unit had lot to be desired. Old wore furniture dirty counter tops in the kitchen grease & dirty blinds in kitchen bugs in light fixtures through out the unit lampshades not attached with on and off switch that were broken just mention few the thing we notice. (Which I have picture to the above areas listed). A total remodel would be in order. Next the staff was not very pleasant at all the staff in the restaurant took there time and had no sense of urgency almost making you feel like you were interrupting theyre day. Then there are the guests (outsider/locals) that were not guest of the resort that were using the pool the whole week we were there. Not very family friendly like the guy that told my wife that he lived in Deland and everyday after work he would stop by the pool bar and have a few drinks while his children swam in the pool and the ocean in front of the so called resort. Also I never saw one employee of the resort policing the pool area so why waste the money on waist bans if you are not going to enforce the use of them. P.S. the man from Deland tried to pick up my wife which is not what I would expect from 5 star resort guests. I will also say in general that most of the guest around the pool used foul language had excessive tattoos and pricing all over theyre bodies which I do not find offensive but is not what I would like my ten nine seven and four year old children to be exposed too. Continuing on with our unpleasant stay at the Grand Seas I happen to notice that most of the cars in the south parking lot did not have parking permits issue from the hotel another step you can do away because no body is policing the parking lots As our mini van was run shacked our last night at the resort. When its all said and done we were very disappointed with what we have been sold it is NOTHING close to what was presented to us when we tour the resort. This is not the family friendly resort that we were told we were getting and something will have to be done before we use it again or return. You need HELP!,robellcec
UR7543505,2007-3-May,I had reviewed all the comments before doing an exchange with interval international. I thought from the pictures it could not be as bad as it seemed. There were some things that worked well All the elevators did work although they were slow it only has 5-6 stories so that was okay. We used the stairs most of the time except when loading and unloading. The front desk staff was nice on check in but that was as far as they got with their kindness. We went one colder morning to exchange towels and the sign on the door said to exchange them at the desk. We went to the desk they stated that linen exchange was open and rather rudely and to go there. At the same time another clerk walked out with towels to exchange for us and the desk clerk with the accent stated take those back they can walk down there. The room was dirty with all kind of items behind the Murphy bed. I had brought cleaning supplies so I did most of my own cleaning. The utensils had food particles caked on them from who knows when. I asked they be replaced or cleaned this did not happen. Bring plastic!!! We had asked them to fix our dripping kitchen sink this never happened either. The lack of a balcony made it difficult to dry our beach towels the towels you get from the hotel are too small for the beach. I did laundry once and the dryers took forever- two times to get the items dry. Overall I liked Daytona Beach but would not return here.,DShowers
UR7987799,2007-25-June,We booked this resort through Interval International. We traded our beautiful 3 bedroom time share in Orlando for the Grand Seas Resort. When we got there my husband checked us in. He was trying to ask questions about the area and the staff wasn't helpful at all. In fact they were uninterested in answering any of his questions. We went to park and unload and there is hardly any parking. We unloaded some of our luggage and went to the room. As I opened the door to the room the door fell somewhat off the hinges and the only way I could close the door was to lift it up and use my hip to slam it. The room was dirty with fruit loop cereal from the previous guest left on the floor. The hotel size shampoo bottles were 1/2 empty and appeared to be previously used. We quickly knew we were not going to stay in this "5 star resort" as listed by Interval. What a joke. We drove down A1A and ended up at the Ocean Walk Resort. Luckily they had a one bed room unit available and we jumped on it. That resort is sooooo nice. Great for kids. They have a lazy river a kiddie pool a water slide mini golf and a video game room. We loved it there and are so glad we paid the money to stay there. We did call Interval International and tell them that we checked out of the Grand Seas Resort after 10 minutes there and they did give us credit for our week. At this point I am afraid to trust Interval's rating system.,Momto3Georgia
UR6623468,2007-19-January,I'm a Grand Seas owner and like others have said they bought in under a lie. I didn't find out about the lie until I stayed there and it was too late to get out of the contract. The sales person told us that owners get free meals during the cookouts and dinners and free soda at the poolbar...this was a big selling point it would save on buying meals for the kids...WRONG they aren't free. We were told the activities were FREE for the kids...WRONG they are not. We let our teenager (19 years old) take a friend and were told we'd have a lockout. Well the lockout didn't lockout and if it would have 2 bedrooms would have shared the big bathroom and an efficiency kitchen and the other side was the fold out couch and full kitchen but it didn't lock out anyway so it didn't matter. We also had a bottom floor room on another stay and the patio door didn't lock from the outside so you had to walk out the front and all the way around to the pool if you wanted your room locked. It didn't lock well from the inside which we notified maintenance about but they never came. Kids were throwing stuff down from the top window every night there would be soda cans and wrappers all over our patio area and the pool deck and the kids would be spitting out the window all day. After about the 3rd day security I guess talked to them as the spitting stopped but the trash continued. There were kids on the exercise equipment that were clearly underage but nobody was telling them to get out of the gym. The Club Navigo people call me all the time and when I tell them I'm not interested they insult me and keep talking. They've called me at work and I've told them do not call me again but they do. I wish I could give the place away. There are much better places if you're looking to buy. Why should you have to buy a movie/internet package the internet should be free like it is in even cheap hotels now. Owners really don't get anything special over anybody who walks in off the street...check-in takes FOREVER. We'll go back just for the area and a bed to sleep in but that's the only reason to go there.,cookie47620
UR7178635,2007-17-March,Like many others I read the reviews for this resort unfortunately after I had booked through Interval International exchange. I thought that before I cancelled our booking I would go back to Interval International and tell them what I had read and ask how it was that they rated this a 5 Star resort with these kinds of bad comments from so many travellers. They told me that 85% of Interval International exchangers rated the hotel highly. I then e-mailed the Grand Sesa directly about my concerns. I received an e-mail back promising me that I would have a great vacation the Front Desk manager would ensure that. How did it go? The location of this hotel is a 10. On the beach and when you arrive it looks great. Front desk check in was smooth and friendly. So far so good I started to relax. Got parked and then found out that the only elevator in our wing wasn't working - no problem only had to lug suitcases up one set of stairs to the second floor (elevator was never fixed during our stay). Unit we were assigned was recently upgraded so it looked nice when we walked in. That is where it ended. Within minutes of our arrival all of our feet were black from walking on the floors. The main bathroom was not clean and the toilet in the main bedroom was plugged up. Looked under the bathrom cabinet and had to plunge the toilet myself. I called the Front Desk and asked that the Unit be re-cleaned and that the toilet be fixed. Next morning a service man arrived and uplugged the toilet - cleaners never made it back so we cleaned the floor ourselves. Next morning when having a shower the shower backed up so we were standing in 2 inches of water - eeeeeeew! On the pool deck pools were unheated and so cold the kids couldn't swim in them unitl the 4th day after our arrival - even then it was like an arctic plunge each time you entered - the ocean was warmer. Why could they not heat one pool in the Jan/Feb timeframe. The Pool Bar was never open during our stay. So much for a 5-Star Resort and the amenities they profess to have. They missed our cleaning day and never got unit looked at until our fifth day there. The worst part of the unit was the noise. Every TV every step every conversation and every chair dragged across the floor transferred to our unit - it was like the other people were living in our unit. Sleeping was impossible until everyone went to bed after midnight. Then it started early in the morning when people woke up. The construction of this place is horrible. So much for a relaxing restful holiday! The constant parade around the pool of sales people trying to sell this resort to unsuspecting clients was irritating to us while we tried to enjoy the pool and deck area and given our experience there made me want to stand up and scream run - while you can - save yourselves! In my opinion - DO NOT BUY HERE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE! I did receive a call from the Front Desk Manager to ask how things were after complaining about the cleaners missing our unit on the Wed but at that point I couldn't be bothered anymore. Stairs to the beach were dangerous and I would not let my children go down them by themselves. In the end we packed up and left a day early and returned back to the Sheraton In Orlando upset and feeling misled by both Interval International and the Hotel. This is not a 5-Star resort period. I will be contacting interval International to discuss our holiday with them. David Loveridge,dloveridge
UR8429147,2007-15-August,We just returned from a week's vacation at Grand Seas. We traded through Interval. After reading the reviews listed here in TripAdvisor I was very worried about going to this resort. It wasn't as bad as I imagined it would be. Our rooms were for the most part clean. They are trying to work on some of the issues. However it looks like the interior walls cabinets counter tops vents etc have had water damage. They've improved some items but they really need to keep spending money on improving the rest. The amenities we felt were very nice. Our family consists of mom dad 5 yr old twin boys and a 14 yr old daughter. We enjoyed their pools playground minature golf pool bar outdoor bands and beach. I have absolutely no complaint about that. I would not recommend this resort for young couples looking to hang out into the evening hours. The band and bars close relatively early. The pool/beach towels are on the chincy side. However their bath towels were decent. If you're accustom to staying at Marriott or equivalent resorts this is in no way a comparison. It is stated that this resort is a 5-star resort. What I've been told is that that doesn't mean the hotel is 5-star like most people would think. It means as a timeshare resort it offers many different activities for families/individuals to take part in and certain amenities for their guests/owners. They did have daily activities for families individuals and children which were fun. We were never harrassed by sales people trying to sell the resort. But we laughed when we saw people that were being taken on tours. We would have loved to see the model they showed these people. If I were in the tour I would have asked to see a "real" room. I'm sure the model room is perfect! Now if they would bring the rest of their rooms up to that "model" standard. Like I said before...it wasn't the best resort but it's not the worst we've traded for. More than likely we would not return. We're confident there are better places to stay.,Twinzmom40
UR8402036,2007-12-August,We stayed on the 6th floor--the elevator was so hot and out of date for inspection--8/1/07 expiration. The indoor pool had a chemical smell in the air that would irritate your eyes after 5 minutes. The outdoor pools were fine--no problems there. The 2 bedroom unit we had was not cleaned very well--coffee spots on the bedroom door--dirty AC vents and a piece of moldy bread in front of the AC unit that was behind a door. The room was ocean front with a nice view of the pool and ocean. The parking lot was too small on both sides of the resort and for whatever reason the resort always had the chain blocking entrance/exit to the main parking olt causing you to go another way that was more difficult to go through with cars coming and going out of the lot. There were also 3 large pot holes in the lot driveway that would rattle you car's shock absorbers. The front desk people also didn't want us to fill out the Interval International Timeshare evaluation--they took it and never gave it back to us. Do yourself a favor and read the other reviews of this resort and you'll see that they have received many negative reviews--I don't recommend this resort and I wouldn't go back.,5starman
UR7580242,2007-10-May,We own timeshare at Marriott's Grande Vista and exchanged a 2 bedroom luxury unit for a 1 bedroom ocean front unit at Grand Seas. To start: we needed (and requested) a handicap accessible first floor unit for a family member in a wheelchair .About 10 days prior to our arrival we called Grand Seas to confirm the availability of the unit. We were informed that we could NOT be accomodated as the accessible first floor units were only available for Saturday check innot Sunday. We called the resort on May 1 and spoke to a manger who again insisted that they could NOT accomodate us. I should have cancelled at that point and booked the Hilton but we persisted and Carlos finally agreed to reserve the requested room. Upon check in on May 7 we were informed that although the first floor accessible room WAS booked for us someone gave it away! The best that they could do was give us a first floor NON accesible unit..Because it was after 4PM we had no choice but to accept the unit. The unit 1044 was down a long narrow hall across from the elevator and trash room. Upon entering the unit we realized that Grand Seas was not what we are accustomed to. The Kitchen We were greeted with ancient blue countertops that were missing parts of the Formica cabinets that the laminate was falling off of knobs that were falling off wetslippery tile floors and very oldworn utensils. The burners on the stove did not fit properly and they did not even supply wine glasses or an ice bucket. The Living Room Again wet slippery tile floors old worn furniture. Nice french doors with view of ocean. Small TV. Phone that had no dialing instructions--not even for an emergency! The Bathroom Very small room with wet tile and Formica cabinets that were falling apart. Could not fit wheelchair through door and even if we could there wasn't any room for it. The Jacuzzi tub/shower had mold growing in the jets and it was not accessible for someone in a wheelchair. The Bedroom One king bednightstandand dresser. Blinds on only window in unit (that every one passing through hall could look into) did not close properly and had no curtain. Worn musty smelling thin carpet on floor. Could not get wheelchair into room and there was no room for the chair anyway. Despite trying to dry floor the kitchen kept getting wet. We realized there was a leak somehwere and at 10:30PM maintenance came and informed us that the copper tubing for the ice maker in the refrigerator was broken and they had to shut the water off. After staying for one night we checked out and went to the Hilton. They did try to accomodate us but without an accessible rrom we could not stay there Pluses Location--right on Daytona Beach Shopping center across street Good sun deck/outdoor pool Indoor Pool Putting green Kids activities Minuses Veryold worn motel style property that had obvious signs of major hurricane damage Inadequate parking In desparate need of major renovation/updating/paint Lack of security- door could be pried open with a steak knife,dpoli
UR4334660,2006-9-January,We own a 5 star unit in Canada (Mountainside Villas in Fairmont BC) have stayed in Vegas at the Tahiti (easily 5 star accommodation) and looked forward to our 1 week Florida vacation. We are new to timeshareing - this experience leaves a very bitter taste. We were somewhat concerned to receive a letter from II after confirmation explaining that some renovations and/or construction was underway at the Grand Seas. We phoned down to clarify this and felt somewhat better having done so. However upon arriving on New Year's eve we were horrified with our accommodation - had it not already been "paid for" we would not have stayed there one night. It is dirty old and unkempt and un-modern; the dishes and cookware are cheap; the stove was barely a hot plate -no burner worked unless you fiddled with it to align the electrical! It was very humid (moldy??; paint was pealing behind the draperies; the bathroom tiling was very dirty. Although 'they' had activities scheduled none ran. There was no welcome. One restaurant never opened; the Beach Bites gift shop never opened. The poolside Tiki bar never opened once even tho' 5 of our 7 days were nearly 80 degrees. Only one of the two outdoor hot tubs was in operation; we used it twice - both of us have itches and rash; having a hot tub of our own we know what this could be. Interestingly on our second tub night we met a local couple who were 'friends' with the security people; this couple told us how nice it was to know the 'right' people which enabled them to use the resort's hot tubs whenever they liked. Nice enough people but what kind of security is that!! The Grand Seas is not the quality they advertise - look elsewhere. PS - the renovations and construction??? Minimal and non-invasive; and definitely not going to upgrade this facility in a million years!! Go elsewhere.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR6085706,2006-8-November,I have just recently returned from my stay at the resort. I have been an owner for 9 years. All I can say is that I am greatly disappointed in the resort. When we first bought our week the hotel was up and coming. Now it is going down hill. There are no more VCR/DVD players in the rooms. They want you to rent a movie for $14 a night. I can buy a movie at that cost. You need to pay to use the wireless connection for your computer. Just about every other hotel it is offered free. Almost all the paint was chipped off of the bathtub. The tile was coming up off the floor in the bathroom. The floors were filthy. Our feet turned black if we didnt wear socks. The store is a joke. They sell more clothes then anything. They are just about the only hotel without heated pools. It is like swimming in the freezer. The front desk girls are ruder than anyone I have ever met. And forget trying to upgrade to a bigger place. You are told they have bigger places but they are on hold for someone to rent. If they are not able to rent them they will sit empty. That was exactly what was told to us by reservations. I have been an owner for a long time but I am treated like a no one. I am so sorry we ever bought in this resort. I wish there was a way to transfer our ownership.,brownldnr
UR5413719,2006-30-June,We have not even had a chance to use our time share at the Grand Seas resort because after making reservations in April for our stay in July low and behold nobody can find our confirmation number in the system. Is it my imagination or does the personal come and go like revolving doors? I think the second our sales rep made the sale she quit. All year long we paid for a two bedroom which is what we bought. Why is it that this is not what we are offered ? We leave in four days and have yet recieved a return call to the hundreds we have left them. Does anyone know of any legal action taken against club navigo I like to jump on the bandwagon.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR5231456,2006-29-May,This resort is a dump. We were very disappointed in every aspect of our stay. Note that there are no balconies in any of the rooms. We found no other hotel/motel/resort on the beach that didn't have balconies. What good is an ocean front view if you can't sit out on a balcony and enjoy the ocean early in the morning or in the evening. Our 2 bedroom unit was in bad need of upgrading. The refrigerator was rusting as well as the microwave. The bathroom vanities were peeling and the air conditioning unit sounded like a jet plane whenever the blower unit came on. The shower door was broken. During the summer months there is a DJ in the pool area every day that plays extremely loud music throughout the entire day. If you want peace and quiet this is not the place to stay. They also have a day guest program so the resort is crowded with people that are not staying there. If you are expecting a 5 star resort you are in for a big surprise. My family will never return.,saturnsl2
UR6177198,2006-26-November,In November 2006 my husband and I had a cerifitcate to visit Daytona for 5 days and 4 nights at no charge and all we needed to do was place the refundable $50 deposit on our credit card and attend a 90-minute sales presentation. We were fine with that 4 nights for $50 was no problem and we received that money as soon as the presentation was over. The problem was the presentation. First the presentation was for the Grand Seas Resort but our acccomdations were in the Palm Plaza Hotel miles down the street. Once we got there there was a young black guy by the name of Jimmie. My husband turned to me and said "I bet you money they give him us". My husband and I are young african americans (26 & 29) and they must have figuired this is someone we could relate to. Wrong! He comes out all loud and swinging his necklace talking about that bling. bling crap. He walks us around the presentation room and back to the big room where they make all their deals. He preceeds to tell us he makes $400000 year he does this time share thing on the side how is likes meeting people on myspace.com lalalala etc. After about 15 mins of talking about himself some other man comes over with the break-down of the contract and they walk away so that we can talk amongst ourselves. I turned to my husband and said " I still don't know crap about Club Naviago" Finally we decided to purchase a 'preview package'. Later that night we got back to our hotel room and starting reading all the information they had given us and realized that were a lot of stuff they never mentiononed. Since we had so many questions we had to write them down to make sure we didn't forget. The next morning we drove down to the Grand Seas to have breakfast and get some answers. Besides the fact that there was pieces of paper in my waffle this day Jimmie had the nerve to insult my intellience by telling me I didn't need to read that's were the problem is. He keeps telling us that we don't need to worry about anything just call him and he will handle everything. During this whole conversation is was touring with another black couple. After me and my husband went to tour their other property The Cove at Ormond Beach and was still not impressed we decided to cancel our contract. You have 10 days to cancel all contracts and receive a full refund. We took all the materials back to the Club Navigo preview center and said thanks but no thanks. Later that night we ran into the couple the was touring earlier that day and they informed us that once we got in the car Jimmy talked about my husband and I so bad it turned them off and they decided not to purchase. We plan on purchasing a time share one day but it will not ever be with Club Navigo. Not to mention they have like 13 resorts and only a couple are in the states.,Ch1mples
UR5514219,2006-26-July,After reading the other revues I just couldn't help myself! My wife & child went to daytona to look at timeshare resorts for purchase well it all started with no place to park. We waited for about 20-30 minutes at the front desk area to talk to someone about seeing a model. During that time we saw at least three different people at the check in desk that were really p.o.'d .One stated that she OWNED that week with deed to a specific unit number so how come she couldn't GET HER UNIT. What do you mean someone else is staying in it! Another couple sitting next to us stated that they paid for a unit to stay that week 6 months prior yet had no place to stay. When we finally talked to someone(by rudely interupting the front desk) we were told to get a voucher at the fitness center to park across the street at the shopping center so as not to be towed. We finally got to see a model unit by asking around And following some sales people. The units are quite nice to bad the rest of the place(the way it 's run )will make you not want anything to do with the place. IN OTHER WORDS STAY AWAY UNLESS YOU LIKE STRESSSS!!!,cobraguy2
UR5900955,2006-2-October,My parents and I just finished our week long stay at the Grand Seas. They were suckered into purchasing a time share at this resort about 5 years ago. The staff is rude - doesn't return calls. There is MAJOR RENOVATIONS taking place. Each day we were there - there was a jackhammer going on the roof and stairs. Several peoples cares were damaged by falling debris. The units have not been maintained and there are not VCR/DVD players available. There was when they purchased but now they have an inroom system to rent movies for $13 each. Internet access is $5/hour. Guess they decided to go to that system since they were not making money on rentals in the lobby (with Blockbuster across the street). Also - the rooms have NOT been updated - appliances don't work properly the floor was filthy and the beds are terrible. You can relax by the pool only if - you are not bothered by the countless number of folks being paraded by on tours (man - did I want to stop them all and tell them DON'T DO IT!) you don't mind a dj blasting tunes all day long you don't accidental sit in the "preferred seating" (even though the rules say - no reserved seating) you don't mind having maintenance coming through ever 30 mins. to make sure everyone is behaving. If my parents could get out they would. BTW - the maintenance fesss is around $800 a year no matter what they tell you! Good location but this resort stinks!,Traveler7373
UR5359125,2006-18-June,overall the resort was nice--but the front desk-was where the problem started--i have kept this in me for a long time-i never thought about posting a review on this until now--well after getting off work this particular day---my family and i headed straight to daytona--i was tired and so was my husband----we knew that we would be late arriving---so after we were near the daytona area-i decided to call front desk and inform them of our late arrival-i told the front desk person that we were very near and just wanted to let them know we are on our way-(there would have been a charge if we did not show upetc)--the front desk person pulled up my information and confirmed that everything was ok--behold when we arrived and tried to check in we were told that our check in date was the next day---my husband and i were tired and exhausted from working all day and driving all night---at this time grandseas was not mailing out confirmation letters-a person would just need to call at intervals(which i did) and confirm the vacation--this was a nightmare for us---they would not check us in----the only conclusion i could come to is that the front desk person did something terribly wrong after hanging up the phone with me or reservation made the error and never caught it----i did call at intervals to confirm my check in date-and each time i called reservation confirmed my check in date----my family and i had to sit in our vehicle and ponder our minds(i had small kids too) about where in the world are we going to stay---the front desk person would not get a manager and showed no remorse or sympathy for us-this was an awful experience----at about 2am we had no choice but to go pay money to stay in a run down hotel where the bed was wet because they left the patio door open when it rained earlier that day and had to check out by 10am--i hope whoever is reading this get the picture of what my famiy and i went through----when morning came we immediately went back to grandseas and spoke with a manager she was very nice and compensated us--but it was not enough to erase a terrible experience such as this one-we have not return to grandseas since----i don't think we ever will----i just hope that management pays more attention to their front desk personnel and reservation area--and understand that when families come to their resort that first impression is representation--overall grandseas is a very nice resort--our two bedroom condo was clean and the people were nice to us--i even showed pictures to friends and relatives--but i never told them about this experience-so if you decide to stay at grandseas--all i can say is stay on top --,A TripAdvisor Member
UR5356760,2006-17-June,Good part: pools and surrounding areas including kid play area and putt putt. Beautiful view of the beach. Bad part: cleanliness. We had buy cleaning products at Publix to clean the bathrooms and floor of entire suite. The smoke detector was hanging from the wall the door lock was broken the bright exterior lighting made the bedroom look like day time all night the cigarette smoke from a nearby smoker seeped into our room throughout our stay and we could hear every noise from rooms above below and beside ours. I wouldn't stay there again.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR6134427,2006-15-November,I have not actually stayed at the Grand Seas Resort. I made a reservation to exchange my Marriiott timeshare at Ocean Pointe in Palm Beach Shores for a unit at the Grand Seas. This was done in July 2006 after I called Grand Seas and was assured that the renovations would be completed by the fall of 2006. They stated there were no possibilities that construction would be going on past October. A few days ago (Nov 9) I received a letter from Interval International stating that the Grand Seas was still undergoing major renovation including roof repair and replacement and major concrete renovations. Interval International was very glad to let us opt out of our stay at Grand Seas and take a week at our home resort of Ocean Point with no penalties. The only penalty I have suffered has been the $50 change fees on two airline tickets when I changed our departing flight from Orlando to West Palm Beach. I called Grand Seas Resort management to see if I could get them to pay one or both change fees - I knew it was only a slight chance of it. The front desk clerk told me the General Manager was "never around" and I spoke with an Assistant Manager. She said the renovations were very minor and would not bother anyone. I told her to look at the TripAdvisor.com reports. She said she would speak with the General Manager about my request and called back in a few hours saying that Grand Seas was not responsible for my changing my plans and would not refund any money. I am so glad that I chose to buy into a reputable company like Marriott that values customers.,Tbugs
UR5610328,2006-14-August,We just returned from a 90 minute (that' s right) visit to this facility. We traded a Marriott Grande Vista lockout for it and feel we were mislead by Interval International as it is rated five star. No way. We changed units but found the soggy moldy conditionsas well as the noise and smoke from the beach bar too much to endure for a week. We toured the grounds and did like the view and the beach although the steps down to the beach were treacherous. Olivia at the front desk was very gracious. The website says this has been completely renovated and it shows stainless appliances. Our unit had an electric stove with crooked coils dating back to the sixties. It had been retiled throughout but was early budget motel decor. We just couldn' t imagine actually sleeping there. We also encountered a young (20's) man in the filthy elevator who told us he and 20 friends had just arrived for the week. I'm sure they were really going to enjoy the loud music and the well publicized 29 cent draft beer. No thanks. We bolted even though it was a huge financial hit to rebook flights etc.,reute
UR5329180,2006-10-June,I bought my timeshare in 1997...have only been able to reserve my 1 bedroom unit three times to stay there. The sales dept promise you every and you actually get nothing.....the maintance fees and operating costs rise unbelievably every year and the service gets lousier. If you don't reserve a year in aadvance you will not be able to get a room and I for one do not know a year ahead of time when my vacation will be the following year.Don't waste your money here...there are penlty of good places to stay...,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2975774,2005-4-January,We just stayed at the resort during the Christmas holidays. Man should I have read these reviews first! Run down had to call security JUST TO GET AN EXTRA BLANKET no internet access (either in the room or their pay to access location) horrible service (everyone had an attitude) left an article of clothing (KNOW EXACTLY WHERE I LEFT IT) and low and behold NO ONE CAN FIND IT! When I called I was told the manager wasn't in until tomorrow (how many times did you guys hear that???) and he would call me first thing the next day. You got it. NEVER heard from him. There was only one shining star. She managed the fitness room and activities desk. I called to see if she could find us something in Orlando as we were going down for the day. I said I'd love to just get on the internet but couldn't get access anywhere in the place. She actually offered to let me come to the fitness room and use hers which I did for almost an hour. Wish I could remember her name because she was indeed the only good experience in an otherwise FORGETABLE holiday.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3824803,2005-30-August,The ads claim that this is a 5 Star resort. No way it is at best a 2 star and that is really pushing it. -The kitchen was so small only one person could get in there were hardly any dishes or cooking utensils the only pitcher leaked. -The table was attached to the wall and could only seat three with any leg room. -The living room had a couch that was worn out bare wood was showing. It was also the other bed and the springs on the bed were missing at the foot. It was really bad we had to take the mattress on the floor so my son could sleep without falling thru. The only chairs in there were wicker and very uncomfortable. -The rooms had no "creature comforts" at all no flowers 1 towel rack in each bath poor lighting in all rooms no rugs what so ever. When the air conditioning went out(2 times) the rooms had no ceiling fans so it was rather stuffy. The elevators were really slow and had no air moving at all they also had expired safety certificates. The mini golf was in terrible shape the carpets were all worn out and had holes in places making play difficult. The landscaping around it was non existant except for bark that was mostly on the playing areas. The pool area was nice and there was chairs but the people smoking made it hard to enjoy the area. the property did sit on the beach but you were not allowed to take the hotle chairs down and they didn't offer rentals. They had pool towels available to be checked out they too were not to be taken to the beach! The pool towels were to be checked out several times we were unable to get any towels because the girl had run out. This was a place I wouldn't recommend to my worst enemy the management refused to talk to us when we brought the terrible condition of the room to their attention less than a hour after checking in. We had exchanged another time share that was a true 5 star for what turned out to be a dump. Run away from this property visit someplace nice.,phsmom
UR3236620,2005-28-February,We have been a Grand Seas owner for several years and always enjoy the resort. Well last time we were there we were lied to and talked into "upgrading" to Club Navigo. Several thousand $ later and a couple hundred more yearly we have the worst service. Nothing has went smooth since and now we can't get reservations because "Club Navigo does not own any rooms" during the time we want to go. I would advise anyone who would listen "Do not buy Club Navigo"!,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3614576,2005-27-June,If you don't mind threadbare furniture no balconies dirty floors stained carpet cleaning service once per week and 3-inch roaches then this is the place to stay. The only positive that I can offer about this place is the pool area which was very nice clean and not crowded. I'm sure the reason for the pool area and the lobby being so nice and clean was to convince the poor saps coming through in a constant stream to buy a timeshare.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3500231,2005-25-May,I was an owner and experienced many of the problems everyone is talking about. I fought with them enough where they finally gave me a quit claim deed. I lost the money I put into the timeshare. but not as much as I would have if I kept paying maintenance fees and payments on a place I could never stay at. On the other hand the one time we got to stay at the resort - the resort was wonderful. It was very centrally located you have everything there you would ever need really loved the pools and deck area and the only downside of the stay was the parking.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3300427,2005-25-March,I have been an owner since 1998.Due to my job have not been able to really use it since 2000.Had a great experience then.Much has changed.Missing dishes TV didn't workin one room and remotes didn't work in any.Despite multiple calls and trips down to desk items not fixed. Had drunk people outside my room partying on the stairs until 3AM (where was security ?) Room was very dirty - scum in jacuzzi tub.Appliences not working . The clincher though is the staff.They couldn't care less what you thought as an owner.Yet I saw the way they treated potential new owners - full red carpet.Once you have bought though they don't care what you think. For the amount I paid for the 2 bedroom unit plus my yearly maintence/tax fees I could have stayed somewhere nice that cared about me the customer. Believe the reviews - they are not a lie.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3497966,2005-24-May,Grand Seas Resort has done nothing but lie to us after the signature on the dotted line! The salesman started off lying to us about not having to pay dues until the end of the year only to find out that thye had to be paid immediately after we had just given them a ton of money. Secondly we wre told that we would get a catalog with a breakdown of prices and never have. We also were told that we had purchased a unit that was grandfathered in and that we could go any time--not just a "colored week." Thirdly they told us that our weeks would accumulate or roll over if we did not use them. We have been paying a ton of money every year and not been able to go in hopes that their word be good. So we decided that we would save and be able to take more than a week. We found out today that--again--it was all lies!!! Granted the facility is nice; but lies will turn customers away quicker than anything. I feel used and taken for granted. I am very angry and would discourage anyone from doing business with these people. Anyone what a condo?,A TripAdvisor Member
UR4040836,2005-20-October,We spent 1 week at the Grand Seas and had lots of mixed emotions. After being discharged from the hospital we rapidly drove the 7 hours to the resort where my son and grandparents had already arrived. When we arrived at 10:30pm we were informed that only one car could park in the lot and we would have to park on the street. We even offered to pay an additional fee to get a permit but we were told no. My question to the resort is you say your 2 bedrooms sleep 6 people yet how many cars can hold 6 people. This was a huge issue. However after my husband had a talk with the manager we were granted a permit two days later. Please beware of this if you are traveling there. The rooms were not very clean and were very cold feeling. Nothing to make you feel welcome or at home. The amenities such as the 9hole putt-putt course along with the kids pool and slide made our stay barable. Gilligans bar had a great all you can eat spaghetti supper on Tuesday night for $4.99. That was another plus. In all I don't think this would be my first choice but for the price you can't ask for much more.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3489180,2005-20-May,I have own my timeshare for about seven years and have yet to use it but it still costs me about $400.00 a year. Not counting the money I had to pay for when damages happen. Tried to use there swap program through interval international and they never had a opening in the resort I wanted that year or even in the area I wanted. Have tried to rent it through them and never received any money from that either of course how would I know if they rent it or not. Have been trying to sell it now for about 4 years and still can not get out of this constant money drain. If I can ever get rid of my timeshare I personaly will never hav anything to do with them again.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3198457,2005-16-February,I recently purchased a Timeshare with Grand Seas. I purchased it to be able to stay there for SpringBreak. When i went to reserve for it they said quote" Due to the amount of people who are willing to rent rooms for 170- 200 a night who do not own timeshares we can not allow you to make your reservations. You can only reserve a room for the timeshare price 5 days before you stay here. Usually we are full by then" the lady on the phone stated to me. Rude. Completly. I was very unsatisfied.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR4024531,2005-15-October,Please people save your money --the points do not work read the back of the contract where it outlines that you own a floating week thats all. They will tell you that you can break it up into days but all you own is a week ---period. READ THE CONTRACT DO not let them rush you thru deeding that is what they will try to do! Now if you want a really good laugh when you are there for a tour-get there in the morning and go in the back and watch them get yelled at in a meeting by some fool who is the leader of the pack its quite funny. Believe the reviews on the dirty place or if you like when on tour stop and ask a guest. The model room are for show only youcannot relax with the constant flow of people on tour walking around. and the gifts are not worth the paper they are written on. all-inclusive resorts are cheaper if you go thru a travel agent. take it from me I got suckered and believed the bs. you can buy a GS timeshare on e bay for 100 bucks instead of 15000,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3194220,2005-15-February,Agree the customer service must be the worst in the country!!(or world)Unfortunately I already bought. They do not answer phones they do not return phone calls and worst-if they tell you one thing you can be sure it will be done wrong or not done at all. I am scheduled to go there in spring - am scared to death what it will be like. PLEASE GRAN SEAS - READ THIS - DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT - YOU HAVE A BEAUTIFUL RESORT AT A BEAUTIFUL BEACH - WITH THE WORST PERSONNEL!,Swissy2
UR3547502,2005-12-June,All the negative reviews are fairly accurate. To get you to buy the timeshare they will let you believe one lie after another. They will not let you out of the presentation until they have cornered you into saying yes. The facility is nice but when the people you trusted keep lying to you about payment and other matters related to the time share then it is not even worth acquiring. I remember we've seen others treated poorly at the end of the presentation bec they had the guts to say no. Too bad for us we already signed and we're too late. Beware future buyers! Do not become a victim of their sales talk. Just better say no than regret your decision in the end!,JaneZ88Florida
UR3178768,2005-11-February,Grand Seas Daytona has the worst customer service I have ever been involved with. My husband and I own Timeshares elsewhere and they are nothing like this. We were told that we had week #9 but if Bike Week ever fell on the 10th week we would automatically be moved. Bike Week is the only reason we wanted the timeshare in the first place. They did not tell us the truth. This year Bike Week falls on the 10th week and guess what. My husband myself and our 4 friends now have nowhere to stay. They will not call back nor do they answer their phones. This is a horrible experience.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2511813,2004-3-September,We booked our vacation in January for June the 5th we asked for a 2 bedroom ocean front. When we got there we had the farthest room from the ocean you could not see the ocean you had to walk around the hotel to see the ocean. We did not have all of our dishes and supplies that come with the room. Whenever we called the service desk or went in they always had teenage girls working that didn't know the answer to anything. The indoor pool had sand all over the bottom and no one would swim in it. The traffic sounded as if it was going through my bedroom. We asked to be moved but could not be. We will never stay at the Grand Seas again. I would rather not vacation!!!,Debbieann915
UR2228873,2004-29-June,I agree with the last review. We visited the week of 6/12 - 6/19. Everything looks great from the outside. The outdoor pools are nice. They are large and clean. The indoor pool and exercise room is also nice and clean and well equipped. Once you make it to your room it becomes a different story. We had a 2 bedroom 2 bath unit. The furnishings are sparse. We hated the tile floors in the living and dining area. Yes they do make your socks/feet dirty no matter how much you sweep or clean them. We had no problem with other areas of cleanliness. The kitchen area was somewhat well equipped considering we bring some cookware from home. It looked to have a newer fridge. The baseboards were not only rotting but parts of them were broken off. You would think that would be something easy to replace considering the annual fees that owners at this resort pay. The Gilligans Grill is just so so and below average. We only ate there the first night because we were so tired from driving and had to stand in line 45 - 50 mins (after 4:00 pm) to register. They said they had "computer problems". It would have been nice if they would have explained that to us before waiting that long. The front desk/customer service staff tries to be helpful but comes off airheaded. The parking was bad the first night but then again there was a wedding reception going on. It was better the rest of the week. I think the best thing was the view overlooking the ocean (we were on the 6th floor). The childrens activities were good. However even our youngest son was just not thrilled with the room. We did trade a home timeshare week for this. If we had of paid their normal rate.... we would have been even more unhappy. The Daytona area is fun and has some really good restaurants. Try "THE WRECK" down by the Main Street bridge. If you are really looking for a GREAT place to stay in Daytona ...check out the Daytona Beach Regency down toward the Main Street Pier. We stayed there last summer in a beach front unit. It has first class customer service and beautiful accommodations.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2791475,2004-28-October,we bought during the preconstuction sale of grand seas for bike week the told us trailers are no problumwe bought a double unit so our children could join us now they cant park there or they will be towed only one car per owner not unit and no trailers our room is nothing like they show you during the sales tour the furniture is mix and match and in very bad conditioni have talked to them for the last 3 years and they tell me next year it will be taken care of.the condition of the unit is terriblecarpet wall bathroomsand im not a picky house keeperwe are treated rudelywhen we ask for assistance with these problumsi own other timeshares some as long as 25 years and is better ran and always a pleasure to stay there they go out of there way to accomidate and the unit looks like new after all these yearsim sooo dissipointer in grand seas,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2320929,2004-25-July,It would seem that we are not the only ones. Perhaps the Grand Seas should look closer at who they employ. While we were at the Grand Seas during the last week of May our room was ALSO broken into. Several wallets of guests that had come to visit us were taken. And a backpack that belonged to our DOG---proof that thieves aren't all that bright. I hope they enjoyed the dog food. The carpet in the bedroom was installed so that there were 'wrinkles' in it. Definitely NOT five star quality. Let's not forget the very HIGH PRESSURE sales tactics. And if you sign to upgrade and then change your mind and cancel they will keep $50 of your deposit! We will NEVER be back at the Grand Seas again.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2317141,2004-23-July,We bought a 2 bedroom unit back in 1998. When they were pesuading us to buy they promised us just about everything. Well everything they promised was a lie!!! We had a difficult time getting a room last year because they have not taken care of the paper work with Club Navigo (another big mistake). Don't join Club Navigo. The resorts look great but good luck booking one during the summer. This year the Grand Seas decided noone can book their week until they prepay their taxes. That is something new. In the past they have always been due in January. I guess they need to hold our money to make interest off of it before they pay the taxes in January. I don't know how this place was rated a 5 star resort. There's NEVER enough parking spaces. The rooms are not as clean as they use to be especially the bathrooms. They have over sold and continue to try and sell their less than great resort. Don't let the looks and salespeople cloud your judgement. And remember they will promise it all to you just to get you to buy!,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2316167,2004-22-July,We almost didn't buy but were promised that the unit's rent easily even told how much we could get. They definatley suckered us. We tried renting our week sent the agreement in ASAP. Never heard from the Reservations department so we started calling it took months (literally) to finally get a call from someone who had no clue what was going on. Customer service is terrible it takes forever for someone to call you back and then your lucky if they can help. Eventually your so fed up you just want to get rid of the week don't expect any help from them. YOUR STUCK.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2311052,2004-20-July,We just came back from a week stay at the Grand Seas. This was an exchange for my 5* timeshare in Orlando. According to their website all units have spectacular views! Well our unit had a spectacular view of the parkinglot and Atlantic Avenue! We were so disappointed that we called our exchange service which tried to get in touch with the resort to arrange another unit for us but no luck. We were promised the manager would get in touch with us and accomodate us. Even after leaving several messages with the head of customer service there they did not get back to us all week. We had the last unit by the road couldn't sleep because of all the noise and couldn't even open our curtains. All kinds of people hanging out on the stairs. Parking was impossible and since we had this wonderful view of the parking lot we witnessed people fighting for a spot even to the point of threatening each other. I had picked this exchange because of the advertised ocean views this was not worth the exchange. We spoke to other customers who had a similar experience and who just left. This resort does not deserve a five star rating. Some of the appliances did not work the plumbing almost came out of the wall. The floors are so dirty you will get completely black feet. I couldn't believe they actually called us for a selling presentation which we declined. Never exchange to this resort they will put you in the parking lot/street view accomodations. My exchange company told me that the resort has the authority to give us any available unit for an exchange not necessary the unit of the owner who is shown on your confirmation. We would have been better off in one of the smaller motels across the street some of them even offer partial beach view. They definitely have false advertising on their website which I fell for. One tip: Always call the resort itself if you want to make sure where your unit is located and drill the staff for information. Don't believe the advertising! Our vacation was a big dissappointment.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2829688,2004-17-November,I have owned at Grand Seas for several years. It has gone from bad to worse. Many problems and broken promise's. Way over booked run down parking is a joke. Front desk is run by young girls with bad attitudes. Difficulty upgrading making reservations getting towels have problems in room fixed. You name it it goes wrong. My son in laws car was vandalized in the parking lot...nothing done about that. On site manager is a moron and just adds to the confusion. I trade my weeks every year and have stayed at many great resorts in Daytona Beach. Save your time and money...enjoy your vacation somewhere else!!,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2887217,2004-17-December,I agree the Grand Seas Resort is terrible for it is not only small but it really needs some major work. Infact if the owners aren't happy they should get together and complain and if all else fails they should seek legal action. After all aren't the owners paying good money for up keep and remodeling? Also I would not have bought if I had been told that this was the only property available. In fact if you really want a timeshare look to the resale market that is where the deals are and you can shop around too... As for our tour we only wanted tickets but once they knew we owned a timeshare they befriended us and then over the next six hours they cut down our Westgate Lakes property telling us that we needed to buy with them. In the end they wore my husband down because he had a bad headache and he missed my dropped hints that we should leave... I was then ganged-up-on by the closing staff and our agent who kept trying to assure me that this was a good deal. I finally caved when the manager vowed he wasn't going to leave until we were happy and he closed the deal! Well I'm Not happy. And "Thank God" for the ten day right of recession which will cancel this mistake. I ONLY HOPE THAT FLORIDA WILL KEEP THIS OPTION AVAILABLE TO THOSE OF US WHO JUST DON'T KNOW HOW TO SAY NO! Finally the State of Florida should take a long hard look at these timeshares regarding code 721. For they {timeshares} make it sound like they can't take advantage of you but in reality they are for you are led to believe that if you say NO you will loose the deal forever. This code is also being used in a deceptive way for they make it sound like the State of Florida is keeping them honest with these regulations. But" how can this be fair or benefit people when in fact this just prevents you from being able to shop around for the best deals out there? Good Luck. Nancy P.S Oh if you want to tour a timeshare for the tickets we have been told by some "Timeshare Pro's" these tips. Hope you can use them where we failed. 1. Tell them you are not interested in buying and that you have just come for the gift and you have agreed to see their property. 2. Don't get into long conversations; if you disclose an interest in traveling this will only give them more ammunition to use against you so that they can go in for the kill. tip {say you don't intend to travel that much or You stay with friends or that You like hotels because you feel that there will always be cheap hotels to stay in.} 3. Take a watch and if the tour is getting too long and drawn out; tell them you will only stay for the ninety minutes and that you expect your gift regardless of what has been done. This might seem rude but just think of the day you will loose if you don't.,A TripAdvisor Member
