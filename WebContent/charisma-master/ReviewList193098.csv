UR125614879,2012-4-March,Located at roughly a ten minute walk from both Barbican and Old street Tubes this out of the way establishemnt is rather deceptively named. Whilst many of the rooms are undergoing "improvements" this seems to have been the case constantly for the pasrt few years and the room quality never actually improves. Bog standard and over-priced. Youd be much better advised to look more centrally OR look for a cheaper alternative in the same area and give this ine a miss.,camster66
UR122453120,2012-3-January,Stayed between Christmas & New Years 2011 with my wife; she shopped & I worked. The hotel is located about 10 minutes walk from the Barbican station and about a 5 cab ride if you prefer not to walk. Reception is well presented & modern and the staff were welcoming and found our reservation with ease; a glitch in the website meant that I was unable to book breakfast with the room and had to pay for that at check-in. 10 per person per day which if you eat like a horse is good value there are plenty of small cafe's nearby if you prefer to eat out. My double room was on the first floor of the hotel and easily accessed by the lifts. Corridors on the first had a musky unpleasant smell to them it was a combination of a food & damp smell. My first reaction when entering the room was how small it was; this was the smallest double room I'd stayed in and I spent about 4 months a year in hotels around the world. The bathroom was big enough to be functional but not so big as to enjoy with someone else if you know what I mean here. As you will see in the photo's the room was very clearly in need of urgent refurbishment and was barely hanging together. What I couldn't show you in the photos was the bathroom floor where about 60% of the floor tiles had no glue fixing them to the floor; they just rattled about when you walk in there. The carpet in the room was threadbare and long past serviceable. The room does not have a mini bar and the space for the fridge was just an empty void which we thought would be useful for suitcases of other large fridge shaped objects. You can use your imagination here. There was no air conditioning in the room and you could switch the radiator on which turned the room into an over or open the window and you froze from the wind whistling in. I really don't expect a modern hotel in London not to have AC in the rooms maybe 20 years ago perhaps. The bed had no cover to the divan and again from pictures I've added you can see what I hoped were water marks and not urine on the divan. The mattress had no mattress protector which meant that I was able to smell all the sweat from the many hundreds of guests who'd used that room before me. Breakfast was a decent choice of hot & cold tea coffee and fruit juices. But as I've said before the 10 charge is acceptable if you eat like a horse. If I stayed again I would use the many local cafe's instead. We had an evening meal 1 night in the hotel and after a wait of 10 minutes our drinks arrived and then after 48 minutes our meals arrived. With about 10 other covers in the restaurant this is a grossly unacceptable wait. To summarise my review; this is a functional hotel in need of urgent refurbishment and modernisation. Based on my frequent use of hotels across London & the rest of the World I don't feel that I got value for money and left with a feeling that once you scratch beneath the shiny veneer of reception the quality drops off a cliff. With the shabby & threadbare state of my room cleanliness will always take a hit and that is unacceptable in my option. I would not recommend this hotel to friends or family and would not stay here again.,Dr_SickNote
UR125283427,2012-27-February,Had to stay here on business for a few days when my usual hotels were booked out. Rate was accordingly expensive. Check-in was slow (however they did come around and offered drinks whilst one was waiting). Room was tiny and very tired. The little floor space that would have been there was taken by an additional foldable bed in my room which also blocked me being able to get the wardrobe open. Bathroom had rusty spots. Asked for additional bed to be removed only to find it still there when returning. Also promised bathrobe did not appear. Bed disappeared after a further intervention. Area of the hotel is nice enough if not a bit removed from the nearest tube station. A lot of school classes were staying in the hotel at the time to be fair though I didn't see/hear much of them. I would have been fine with the above at maybe 60/night but not at just under 200/night.,insulaner1984
UR123662027,2012-26-January,We had a straight forward though a little strange request when staying at the thistle barbican. We booked a nights stay either side of a nights stay booked with the rest of our company to make a little break out of a long journey. My wife phone a head of the trip to explain the situation of or 3 nights stay which was no problem over the phone. However on check in the reservations team found the fact that we were staying three nights all in the same name albeit two different bookings hard to understand. Eventually the lady got the jist of our stay and got us to fill reservation cards in for the three nights saying we would not need to check in daily as first suggested. After our second nights stay the one the company booked and paid for we went for breakfast to find ou we was not on the breAkfast list and we needed to speak to reservations. After a lengthy conversation the situation once again was said to be fine for us to have breakfast and enjoy our day. Seen as it was our final day we decided to head out after breakfast sight see all day see a show then head back to the hotel. On our arrival to our room after a long long day imagine our suprise to come to a room that had not been made up. We tried to call reception to just ask for some tea and coffee to have a late night drink but the room phone was broke. My wife went to reception to ask for tea coffee explain about the room and tell them the phone was broke. They said the room had not been made up as we did not show for the previous nights stay. So my wife explained the situation again and reception said they would bring the tea and coffee to us. After 40 minuets and nearing 00.30 hours we were still waiting. We called reception from our mobile phone and asked politely for the tea and coffee again it eventually arrived some 50 minuets after we first asked for it. I can't believe this simple reservation request could cause such a mix up. It put quite a massive downer on a lovely break,blackpoolmanLytham
UR123364100,2012-20-January,I booked a group of 13 of us and the hotel went into meltdown. Staff was the most unhelpful i have ever encountered they just could not care less. It took us nearly an hour to check in by wanting to pay all rooms in one card I was made to feel this was the most outlandish request ever heard! Location was poor as well not in the city at all! Some back alley roundabout way to feel part of the city of london. Never again.,Ritafromsomerset
UR124467780,2012-12-February,Bad value for money. The rooms are clean but shabby and need a refresh. The cold water tap only produced hot water so I could not get a drink of water during the night which was made worse by the unbearable temperature of the rooms. The shower temperature was fine the first morning but the second morning the water was s hot I could not take a shower. The walls are very thin and I could hear all the phone conversations of the woman staying next door. The staff were friendly and helpful but the rooms really let this hotel down.,amy n
UR119110345,2011-9-October,We stayed at this hotel organised by the company we work for thinking great it's at same location as our two day induction only to be disappointed not only with the room and level of cleanliness. But also the food in the restaurant. When we checked in they asked us if we wanted to book a table for dinner which we duly did however when we went down for dinner there was no table for us available. I could go on but would not recommend this hotel to anyone. We stayed in the main buidling too.,Eastwoodn
UR115179631,2011-9-July,I stayed in the Thistle City Barbican for 1 night for business. the hotel reservation was not done by me but by my colugue we stayed at a time when Wimbledon Tennis match took place so most hotels in London were fully booked and there was not much choices. Check in was good reception and lobby area gives a feeling of good hotel service was good. However when we arrived to our room it was all completely different. Single Room size is small but it was ok. My room was old no A/C safe didnt work but they sent someone to come and fix it. Shower was ok and clean. but what bothered me the worst was the internet service. You have to pay extra for it but also it did not work I needed it badly since I needed to work. I ask someone from the staff to come to my room and see why I cant use the internet but their answer was that there is a problem with the service provider and if I wish I can go to a McDonalds 5 minutes from there for internet (at least the staff was trying to find alternative solution which was nice of them). Breakfast was standard and good. No complains about that.,Moreno132
UR116464281,2011-9-August,We stayed in a twin room in May 2011. The hotel was very busy and check in was very chaotic- exacerbated by the fact that that it is used at the weekend by a hen night website. Our room was very small and although the bedroom was fairly clean the bathroom was not- hairs in the shower and the toilet had not been cleaned properly. The beds were okay but my pillow was rock solid. The hotel does provide spare pillows but these were all the same! We had a drink in the bar downstairs and found it very expensive. There is a swimming pool but it was packed full and very noisy. One positive was that breakfast was delicious- an enormous selection of continental and cooked breakfast buffet- I couldn't fault this. I was disappointed by my stay at the Thistle because as a well-known chain I felt that it failed to meet basic standards. I only needed a comfortable bed for the night in a clean room and it fell short on both!,Suzanne88
UR120332250,2011-8-November,Really a dower hotel in the middle of nowhere. Evening food was sub-standard - gristly. What ever you do don't order the Cumberland sausage and mash as they'll come back to you after an hour to tell you they haven't got any!,ClarkeAT
UR107413627,2011-8-May,the hotel was charging 145 for this single room (walk in rates)- this has possibly got to be the worst example of a 4 star hotel room I have experienced in my life. Badly maintained. Appauling standards. Extremely slow front desk. Understaffed and inefficient. please see the attached pictures,cjb222
UR120276432,2011-7-November,I was only here one night as I had a course nearby. The room was basic with 2 single beds instead of the double I had booked. The window was jammed open and even the reception and handymen couldn't close it so I had noise drifting in all night (luckily it wasn't a cold night) I couldn't get a clear picture on the TV and the bathroom was dingy and not very clean looking. Considering I spent close to 200 on this I am not happy.,sambolace
UR121489798,2011-7-December,As I write this I am holding for "Customer Service" at Thistle - not for the first time. And yes....the lines gone dead. Be warned the customer care number on the website is for reservations not customer care. That number is 0207 138 0000 wher you will put through to customer srvices who dont pick up. on november 24th my wife and I booked in for one night. It was last minute but the location seemed ok. Ir ithis was a truly awful experience and thank god it was for only one night! It is a souless place but the staff were pleasnat enough. The room was terrible and the noise that the 4 or 5 people in the room next door made - all night - was of relentless. The constant wrapping and unwrapping of cellophane packages could be heard through the connecting door. What were they doing ?? The window catches were broken so noise from outside was awful too. The bathroom was very grim  broken taps stains. At reception the next morning we were told that their computer system had crashed and that invoices would be emailed. We asked that the manager call us so that we might explain how unhappy we were. Neither has happened. So we learnt a lesson. Dont stay at the Thisltle City Barbican even if it is last minute. Even if g rer next  God obsolluess,craigeuan
UR120207014,2011-5-November,How Thistle can put their name to this hotel god only knows. I really can't think what tourists coming to England must think if this is their first impression. Based in a really run-down area of London the hotel is situated in what is basically a back street with a filthy entrance area. Once inside one is greeted by incompetent (although pleasant) staff. No-one else was was at reception but it still took 20 minutes to check-in. When finally given my key i was directed to room 2114. The room is a throwback to hostels of the '70's with filthy floor and walls peeling wallpaper ceiling tiles falling down and a tiny bathroom with cracked tiles mildew and a 99 pence shower head. The window would neither open or shut properly with broken locks and an outlook over a half-derelict shopping precinct. At least the bed was comfortable but that may have been because I was levitating for fear of catching something. Breakfast consited of overcooked and congealed food (and i was down for breakfast at 7.15 am). The receptionist summed it up when i responded to the question "did you have a pleasant stay?" by stating "absolutley not the room was a disgrace" she just shrugged her shoulders. A truly horrible hotel.,doughboyBolton
UR95613820,2011-5-February,Check in staff were pretty slow and their uniforms have definitely seen better days. I stayed in the annexe block and the rooms are not good at all. Rooms are small and very shabby. It's quite a noisy area too. Room rate for a single bed wa 94.50 - very poor value. I really do not recommend this hotel.,Travelling_Scot_10
UR121433668,2011-5-December,Stayed here for one night on business as I was attending an event at the barbican. My room was in the tower across from reception. My first room had a screeching bathroom fan that could be heard from the corridor. Reception moved me quickly so no complaints there however the second room was very small with a tiny bathroom. Cleanliness was average but as the decor is so 80's no amount of scrubbing would ensure the room felt properly clean. Overall whilst the room was cheap for the area I wish I had paid more and gone somewhere better. I cant fault the service of the staff though.,Matthew_1975
UR116318721,2011-5-August,A really disappointing stay and poor value for money. First room had bed bugs. Staff moved us promptly but did not seem surprised. In the second room the air conditioning unit dripped water on to the carpet. During the day staff used a towel from the bathroom to soak up the water - but didn't replace the towel! Sunday breakfast very busy and understaffed - had to wait for fruit juice to be replenished tea / coffee to be served.,phandcab
UR102918185,2011-5-April,Stayed in the annexe for 5 nights the walls are paper thin was woken by snoring alarm clocks shower phone calls and televisions in neighbouring rooms. Also the 15min walk from Old Street Station does not feel safe after dark.,W0rktrip
UR115028773,2011-4-July,I think this was pound for pound the worst hotel I have stayed in. Overpriced dated rooms with tiny single beds no mini bar and the worst tea tray that 220+vat can buy. Oh and that doesn't even get you free wireless or a flannel. Lame.,Chop26
UR116242056,2011-4-August,We reserved two rooms next to each other for the children to be near us. They did not provide and could not change during stay. Staff was not helpful.One of the room was smelling tobacco and the smoke alarm was covered with a nylon. Generally not clean rooms did not change towels and did not replace shampoo etc. The tel in children room was not ringing  complained and nothing happened. Breakfast was fine but you had to wait a long time to be seated.,marcoslim
UR119977207,2011-31-October,been here 4 times before not clean never be pushed into staying in the rooms across the roadmeals too expensive manager didnt want to help with my complaints about room parking a painthis time is the last time our company will use this hotel,kristalgazer
UR102309578,2011-31-March,I can honestly say i would rather sleep in my garden in the pouring rain than stop another night in this hotel! Everything was wrong about it! We have stayed in a thistle hotel before in london and it was fantastic so booked into this one expecting the same standard. The room we were staying in was in the other building. Right next the stairs and lift. The walls were cardboard thin the two carpets on the floor stapled together and turning up. Wallpaper was running off the wall there was chunks out of the furniture and beds as well as staining. Our view outside the window was right into someone 25 other peoples rooms. The tv mounting on the wall was terrible. We had to swing it to the door to get to the dressing table and swing it back again to watch or get out the door. For a hotel chain with a good reputation this hotel should just be knocked down and put some place else. Perhaps they could put another lot of tower flats. Thats all that was around you anyway. Took forever to get into the centre and you never felt safe if you were walking back in the dark or even to the shop accross the road. Im glad we booked into a new hotel because spending another night there would be torture.,JessieDaydream
UR110523144,2011-30-May,I stayed here for one night on business and found the whole experience just awful - there was not one redeeming factor. Check in took forever and there was not enough staff on the desk to help speed up the process. After checking in I was given directions to my room which involved going back out of the main entrance of the hotel and across the road into an adjacent building. Upon entering this building I did not feel safe. Anyone could come in there was no reception area staff or security. I found my room and felt dismay. The building has obviously been converted into rooms.......unsuccessfully. The room was tiny and shabby. The room was in a general poor state of maintenance but particular points to note were the ceiling windows and door. The door did not seem to lock correctly. I tried this from the inside and outside and felt it could be opened without a great deal of force. I informed reception who said it was fine - they would not send anyone up saying they were very busy. The ceiling was dirty and looked like an old office ceiling. The windows were rickety would not shut correctly so I could hear everything from the street outside - didn't bode well for a good night's sleep. I ordered room service - evening meal and breakfast. Both were very disappointing. My evening meal was cold and the meat was of poor quality. Breakfast was better but it's not hard to get toast and cereal wrong :) I would never ever stay here again.,tsmac2
UR116016063,2011-30-July,clearly no value for money : outdated rooms outdated conference facilities & below-average food; staff tough is doing their best but are beaten by a lack of investment in the facility.,No_Belgian
UR91519226,2011-3-January,First we were given a room I suppose had not been occupied for quite a while. The double-bed room was a corner room (2101) the bathroom tiles were peeling off the wash basin took >5 minutes to fill a 1L water jug. The cistern was not functioning properly taking >30 minutes to fill up. It's just worst than a hostel room! We complained and was given a slightly bigger room (2127). winter-time and the heater was not functioning! after complaining the heater was ok but no thermostatic control. Bathroom fixtures were badly maintained. I wonder how the maintenance were doing their work. At the rate they were charging I wouldn't recommend this place. It's just not as advertised! The rating was based on the second room.,ChongSS
UR110193860,2011-28-May,I stayed for one night in this hotel and there is no way I would stay there again. It cost 278 pounds for bed and breakfast (late booking). The bar only had one beer on tap the staff at reception were all trainees so none of them knew what they were doing. In the tiny room the wall was made like a prefab so the walls shook and I could hear everything in every other room. No free wi-fi even the gym and spa had to be paid for. The shower had two settings roasting or boiling it's impossible to take a shower. Breakfast was a buffett affair one staff member brought re-heated coffee and everything tasted the same. The whole place was some kind of joke and expensive joke mind you. For the love of God stay somewhere else.,Bodhan
UR101928706,2011-28-March,Stayed here for one night on business in March 2011. A very average stay main points are: - unresponsive staff at reception but pretty good / friendly in the bar area - tiny room with an even smaller bathroom but relatively clean and comfortable. No frills. - ominous 1960's style building in the middle of what looks to be a pretty rough area although did not spend any real time exploring it. - the hotel is around 10-15 minute walk from any decent bars/restaurants - the radiator in the aforementioned tiny room swung (noisily) into action at around 5:30am making it unbearably hot pretty quickly A few others I spoke to seemed to have nice rooms which suggested to us they were renovating the rooms floor-by-floor starting at the bottom (I was near the top) but my honest opinion is that there are plenty of decent hotels in London at a cheaper cost than this one. I would therefore suggest staying in one of those places and avoiding the Thistle Barbican.,rhyd78
UR114799349,2011-27-June,Upon arriving at the Thistle City Barbican we found that the outside of the hotel looked very shabby but we we're relieved as we got closer to the entrance and realised that the main front of the hotel looked alot nicer. We arrived early so were not able to check in but left our bags with the pleasant concierge so that we could relax in the hotel spa and attend our pre booked treatment appointments. When entering the spa reception we were informed that there were not enough padlocks for thier lockers as they only had one padlock left we would have to share a locker - Therefore 9 of us had to squeeze our handbags into one locker. The changing rooms pool and spa area were all clean. When we asked for extra clean towels there was no fuss. We were dissapointed when the final person in our group awaiting a spa treatment had been forgotten about meaning that we had to wait for a further hour after our appointment time as the treatment team had already started other apponitments. We were not kept informed and I persume that this was all a result of a lack of communication within thier team. We then checked in at around 3.30pm with no fuss. We had booked 4 bedrooms and they were all allocated very close to each other. The rooms are clean however very tired and worn. There was no air conditioning just a fan. The beds are very small with extra hard pillows not the most comfortable beds to sleep in. As there was a large group of us we had emailed the hotel prior to our arrival with a pre order for the restaurant this is where the problems began... We sat down to be told that all 9 of us would have to eat the same tomato soup starter chicken main and torte for dessert. We advised who I persumed was the restaurant supervisor that we had pre ordered our menu. The gentleman said that the hotel had not recieved the pre order and chef had already prepared the food. Therefore we asked to speak to the duty manager to took at least 10 minutes to show his face. He asked us to provide proof that we had emailed the order which we said we would get he then said that he would go and speak to the chef to see what they could do. WE NEVER SAW THIS MANAGER AGAIN! After another 15 minutes had passed we noticed that the table next to us were complaining as there was also a large group of them we thought we would ask what was wrong. They had also been told that they all had to have the same food with no choice however after complaining they had been told that they could order whatever they wished from the room serive menu. At this point we still hadnt had anyone come back to us with an answer or compromise. So again we went and spoke to the restuarant supervisor at this point a very pleasant gentleman who introduced himself as the front office manager couldnt help but over hear our complaint so offered to help us. 45 minutes after we sat down for dinner we were told that we would all have to have soup and that they would also provide a vegeterian option for main course. As it was now nearly 9.30pm we just agreed. We do not understand how a hotel of such capacity could not offer a table of 9 more than a one choice menu. The restaurant was dead. No manager was willing to help us and our pre order was just ignored even after provding email evidence. If we were 9 people who had just come down to the restaurant for dinner i'm pretty sure that they wouldnt have dictated to us what we had to eat!!! For all of this inconvienice we were given a glass of wine each. The soup was straight out of a tin and had probably been microwaved the chicken came with 2 new potatoes and was served cold. The vegetarian choice was spaghetti with tinned tomatoes. After a dissapointing starter and main we were all looking foward to dessert. The restaurant staff bought out everyone a slice of bakewell tart the tart was straight out of a packet and served with what was meant to be buttercream but lacked any sugar so was just butter! Bakewell tart had never been mentioned as a dessert choice so we were all dissapointed When we asked if there was an alternative e.g sticky toffee pudding (which was on the main restaurant menu) we were told that there was not enough portions left then after 10 minutes some sticky toffee pudding appeared for 3 people. Generally the hotel managment need some training on how to deal with complaints. They will be recieving our feedback and we are very much looking foward to seeing what they have to say i'd also be interested to know what happened to the duty manager that was asked to deal with our complain who we never saw again! I'd strongly reccomend the chicken diner across the road for dinner cheap quick service and very pleasant staff mayber the Thistle could learn something from the chicken Diner! I will not be staying at a Thistle hotel again they have no interest in thier guests satisfaction only the money that they're spending!,Charlene01
UR121046138,2011-26-November,Mum & I stayed here last weekend [19th Nov]. The only good thing about it is the staff! Hotel needs decorating rooms cramped. Breakfast like Butlins! We had a drink in the bar after a brilliant show - Warhorse-I fancied some olives. They arrived in a bowl on a plate with wrapped white plastic toothpicks to eat them with.[ Very Tasteful-not!] I had eaten about 5 when I noticed another toothpick in the bowl. We looked at each other with horror. The waitress was very apologetic and reported her concerns to the on duty manager. She gave me my money back and said a manager would speak to me in the morning- he did not! We won't be staying here again. Sorry to the staff.,Sheshep3
UR101520654,2011-25-March,If this is a 4 star hotel I very much recommend those people who determine the star rating need to make an urgent visit. Just two receptionists in a 400+ room hotel at the busiest time of day - you guessed it - 15 people in the queue in front of me = 20 mins to check in. I was given a room in the block over the way that turned out to be a shoebox facing onto the road junction. It was red hot in the room as the radiator was on full blast. Went to open window to find the windows filthy; so too were the net curtains - indeed they had blood splats on them. Disgusting. It took me 30 seconds to find this so why didnt housekeeping? Back to reception - just 12 people in the queue this time so only 15 mins to wait. Explained problem and was given a twin room on the top floor of the main building. The room was much bigger although it too was very hot despite the radiators being cold. You could hardly open the windows there was no a/c and the faulty fan in there did little to move the air. How can hotels in London be classed as 4 star unless they have a/c? The single bed was something i'd expect to find in Mrs Smiths B&B in Bognor not a four star in London. Cheap uncomfortable with the hardest pillow Ive had in a while. The wallpaper was peeling off the walls the tv picture was fuzzy. Thankfully the shower worked ok although with two separate taps instead of a proper mixer it wasnt easy to get an ambient temperature. Big queues at breakfast with no queue management - have to admit the breakfast chice was fairly good although they have way too many tables squeezed into the restaurant. 20 people queuing to check out so asked for an envelope for speedy check-out. There was a box on the wall with a big sign saying "pop your speedy check-out envelope in herre if you need to check out quickly". Receptionist told me there weren't any envelopes so speedy check out wasnt an option. All in all a very disappointing experience and for a 4 star hotel a total let down.,ianjmorley
UR114736763,2011-25-June,Stayed here on a recent business trip. Had previously stayed in the Hotel Russell and enjoyed my trip to the big smoke. Not this place. The actual rooms are just shabby and tired but they pretty clean. However the bar restaurant dinner and breakfast is SHOCKING! First of all I ordered a burger for 14.50 from the menu. When it came it was a dry supermarket bun with a very poor reformed frozen burger in. I was handed a sachet of sauce! When I tried to explain to the waiter I would like some desert he asked if I wanted it before my burger. It took about 10 mins to be served (at the bar) even though there was no cue. Mainly this was due to the entire staff not been able to understand you as they don't speak english. When I saw the bill my burger was 16.50!! This was due to a service charge of 20% being added. I pointed out that nowhere on the menu does it state this and then they refunded me. Dodgy! Breakfast was simply a farce! When you have over 1000 rooms you would expect more than a choice of toast fried breakfast some cheap looking cornflakes and some dry fruit! That was basically it! 100s of people trying to find some edible. If you have to stay here it will do but for 150 pn it's really bad!,ki&mandy
UR94251346,2011-24-January,Tiny tiny shabby old cupboard of a room for one. Broken window therefore lots of traffic noise. Hard bed and solid pillow - woke with a crooked neck. Smelt of disinfectant. Staff let the room to another visitor who was very disgruntled that he couldn't get in! (fortunately had the chain on!). Phone to reception wasn't working properly so spent a very anxious 1/2 hour before I could get through to anyone to let them know. Certainly did not match the photograph on the web. Would not recommend to anyone. Maybe the double rooms are better?,annejanewaters
UR97804422,2011-24-February,The Thistle Barbican is a truly horrible hotel. The room I stayed in was dirty with peeling wallpaper sticky lino flooring in the bathroon a tiny lumpy bed and noise coming through the thin walls and rattling windows all night. It really is dreadful. I wouldn't stay here again even at the "good" rates that you can unsurprisingly get at lastminute.com,Marc017
UR117183504,2011-24-August,I was working with my team in London for a week and unfortunately our company booked us into this '4 star' hotel. On arrival the receptionist REFUSED to accept our pre supplied company credit card which the room had been booked on and demanded alternative payment (i.e. my personal card) at a rate 50 per night higher than we had booked for. This was 7 people (195 per night). After lengthy discussions calling the manager who had booked the rooms at 11pm (we'd had a long day!) we finally managed to get checked in and room keys issued (took over an hour). Impressions of the rooms? Dirty small badly in need of an overhaul wall paper hanging off floor tiles in bathroom peeling curtains hanging off peephole glass in door missing (could see the bed from the corridor) and to cap it all off one of the rooms main door handle fell off when trying to get in. Took another 45 minutes for that person to be found another room! This hotel does not deserve 4 stars and I'm embarrased for all the foreign visitors who stay here there are far better cheaper hotels. My team an I will be staying at a Grange Hotel when we go back in couple of weeks. A few of us have stayed in ones before and they are lovely (oh and at least 50 a night less!),James R
UR120966520,2011-23-November,Choose your London hotel carefully i stayed at the Thistle Barbican last night and wasnt impressed i paid  126.00 for a room which made a travel lodge feel like the Savoy. Dont let them fob you off with a room in the block opposite the main building. I had a first floor room next to the main road traffic lights. the window was such a bad fit that i heard every vehicle pass by the room was cold because the radiator was no more than luke warm the wallpaper was peeling the ceiling was dirty the tiles were falling off the bathroom wall and the bathroom was so small that you virtually had to stand in the bath to close the door Everything was poor quality.I ate in the hotel restaurant and although the food was ok i resented paying a service charge for a waitress who was rude and to say the best had only a basic understanding of the English language. I complained at reception when checking out but was offerded only a passing apology. Whatever happened to value for money and good levels of service in this country!,Duncan T
UR115630799,2011-21-July,I was booked in with a large group on a business trip for 1 night .I was shown to a room on the second floor which was disgustingly dirty.The window was covered in mould and the sill outside was covered in filth and fag ends.two club type chairs were covered in stains-did not want to look too closely and the duvet cover had a blood stain on it.I asked to be moved and was shown to the 4th floorThis overlooked the main street but overall a grubby hotel with no hospitality tray and pillows so cheap and hard you end up with a headache.,yorkshirefoodie30
UR118388424,2011-20-September,430 for two nights in a dingey single room at Thistle Barbican. The room is shoddy - peeling paint - the cold tap runs hot...and no one answers the phone on reception after 15 mins waiting....what a terrible terrible hotel,pmallett11
UR120818558,2011-20-November,I have to say this is one of the worst hotels I've stayed in in London. My room had the smallest twin beds possible and both were ROCK HARD. I'm pretty sure some of the rooms have been refurbished but the room I was in definitely was NOT. I'm pretty certain it was because I wasn't in the main building (if you have to go outside and cross the road to get to your room after you've checked in you're in trouble...). Wifi isn't free and I wouldn't say it's in the best area. Wouldn't recommend this one.,misteri0ustraveller
UR109048407,2011-20-May,totally agree with other travellers on the tired decor which could be forgiven but what really annoyed me was the lack of care by the staff who dont seem to care about customers. No hairdryer in room and noone answered the reception phone despite 20 calls. Rooms dirty...especially the bathrooms with dirty taps and toilets. I called the hotel several times before i stayed and was hung up on and witnessed the phone ringing whilst checking in and reception staff (including the manager!!) lifting the phone off the hook and laying it on the counter !......would never ever stay here again,McNamaraManchester
UR115589419,2011-20-July,Bad points for me: *15 minutes walk from Barbican tube station - if I had to do it in the dark I would not feel safe as a woman on my own *in a run-down area *I had a single room the size of a shoe box overlooking a busy road with wallpaper hanging off the wall paint flaking off the skirting boards matchbox for a bathroom *the pillow was as comfortable as a balloon *a plate of singapore noodles for dinner consisted of a handful of vermicelli with insipid curry powder four slivers of peppers boiled egg and cress - cost 11.50 *shabby decor graffiti by the lift wallpaper ripped Good points (struggling here): *had a new shower curtain! *convenience store and pizza takeaway opposite (can take the food back to the hotel apparently) - lovely man owns both *nice girl who checked me out Think very carefully about whether to stay here. It was very very disappointing. I feel sorry for the poor tourists.,luvvacurry
UR117594335,2011-2-September,Stay away from this nightmare of a hotel. There where silverfish scuttling about the carpets and bathroom floors. Especially galling when you used the bathroom in the dark so as not to wake someone else to then see that in the morning special moment I wouldnt recommend anyone repeat. They also put you in a building across from the main building and then charge you a 5 surcharge for bringing the foods to your room. This place needs to be avoided at all costs and should be closed.,JohnCHants
UR95321127,2011-2-February,I was in the annex shoddy decor old fashioned room door had a very bad lock and no chain which was worrying the shower only had one temperature-scolding. The whole place needs refurbishment although reception area was nice. I was there on business but if I had paid for the room myself I would have moved elsewhere. Stay in a premier inn instead the rooms here are in a 1980s timewarp.,anom26
UR120785031,2011-19-November,Stayed for business and had a very pokey single room in the second building. However collegues had superior room that were literally 3 more so if you have to book early and pay for an upgrade. Breakfast was terrible especially for the price. Save your money and go to one of the cafes just across the road. Thistle wanted 17 each the cafe served four of us for 15 with large helpings! Wifi isnt free in the rooms - Bt Openzone. Use ipass if your company has it. London is expensive enough without being ripped off for breakfast before you start the day! Check in was very slow and they dont provide porters lots of twisty turny corridoors to rooms.,kingmobuk1
UR114326953,2011-19-June,Going to this hotel I've realized how poorly they can get. The first day we got there the refrigerator wasn't working the toilet barely flushes and there was scorching hot water. The carpet was uneven and you could feel the the bumps because it was poorly carpeted. We called the front desk because our phone wasn't working but they never came and on top of that every day for 5 days we asked for a wake up call and we got it twice out of 5 days. I felt uneasy going into the hotel because it felt unwelcoming from the outside and the floors gave me chills. I heard a myriad of noises and on the 6th flood there is a room with a mattress and a broken fan and two places with flickering lights. The ATM machine did not work the second fire exit we wanted to go down instead of taking the elevator was shady and did not look promising. There is no off limits sign which there should be where it is necessary. The food was okay sometimes you have to wait a while for a person to bring you to the table. Overall I really wished I could go home from that trip.,blackholes
UR115490038,2011-18-July,This hotel was an utter disaster and for me to say that means a lot considering I only stayed here one night. I booked the hotel a few weeks ago on my way to Cambridge. I wanted to have a resting stop from my flight from the States. The people who work there are very nice but in the words of Karl Marx: "The road to hell is paved with good intentions." Here we go: 1) I asked for a wake up call that evening as well as the next morning from two different people for each occasion. Neither happened and it never seemed to phase them 2) The internet which was promised to work in the rooms did not. This was a surprise being that they tout themselves as a business hotel. When I booked the room I was under the impression there would be internet because they promised it. I had a lot of work to do that night and suffered great stress as a result. To make matters worse when I reported the problem to the concierge they told me that they use internet from a company and that I should call the company to see what was up. They didn't seem to think that it was their problem at all. Also if you want internet you have to pay a separate fee. 3) The staff are slow and clueless. They can't multi-task nor can they remember what time you asked them to order you a cab. All of the staff members look like they are 12 years old and just seem apathetic towards guests. And everything takes them five hours to do and figure out. Checking in and checking out seems like a daunting project for them. Stay away!!!!!!,sarahmacs
UR104491579,2011-18-April,The room decor looks like something from the late 70's/ Early 80's and the bathrooms look like they have never been cleaned. As one of my friends said '' It looks like Laura Ashley has gone into the room and vomited''. The hotels reputation may be better if they had good customer service but unfortunatly 99% of staff struggle with the english language. Please Do not stay here there are hotels that are 100% nicer and alot cheaper!,Hatchback
UR118235898,2011-17-September,Me and my friend stayed in the Thistle this time last year we would of wrote of a reveiw sooner but didn't know how. I will know tell you our story. Firstly we arrived after a long lousy journey at about 4 ish. Only to find our room was not ready. We were on a tight schedule and had to be out by 5 so were rushed. Then after finally recieing our rooms keys we went to our room then all hell broke loose. The skirting boards were scratched the shower was pathetic horrible veiw noisy broken fan rock hard pillows stained carpet toilet not flushed from last usage dagger lamps and a HAIR in the shower. Whilst getting ready a unvited visitor (a cleaner) open our door and walked in then saw us didn't apologise and walked back out. It was scary for to young girls as we didn't know who this women was at the time as the cleaning staff had no uniform. The breakfast was discusting and there was a hair in my sausage. Location was rubbish don't be fooled by the website or the posh hotel lobby. However staff were friendly and when the shower broke they came up straight away. Take our and the 78 other pages of advice don't stay here.,jo a a
UR100539641,2011-17-March,In order to avoid lible charges all I can say is that the best thing about this "Lastminute Mystery Hotel" was the barmaid as it's a mystery to me as to how Lastminute has the gaul to pitch this as a fab venue. Stay away via Lastminute unless you want a shoebox room and surly reservations staff.,JEPHanley
UR96957943,2011-17-February,Having read other Tripadviors reviews I requested the main building. The staff were fine and I got this. Thats about the only good thing to say. There was a 10 minute wait to check in and next morning a queue for breakfast. In the room - I killed two mosquitos one light was not working and the others were dismal mainly because of accumulated dust. The carpet was threadbare and the chair was worn through to the cushion underneath. There was noise all night from pipes. The ceiliong fan was not working - the switch was sheered off. The bed was a foot from the wall and had no fixed bed head. There was a puddle from the radiator when you turned it off. If you left it on it was very stuffy - these are small rooms. If you opened the window a crack - all that you could - you needed top open the heavy curtains also to let any ait in - office blocks opposite left lights on all night. So nothing very terrible for a 3 star London hotel but one night of scruff and dust was enough. Strangely there were two ironing boards although as the room was over stuffed with furniture I would have been challenged to find somewhere to put one up.,amy000
UR104376915,2011-17-April,For the 1st time ever I let a friend book a hotel for us & this was it!!! Never again will I make the same mistake. This place is horrible. It is dirty. It is in a rubbish location. I really cant say anything nice about it. The lobby isnt hideous its just the rest of the place. The check in & out was sooooo slow so many people had to wait ages.... Stay in a Premier Inn for the same price at least they are clean!!!!,PB1Oxford
UR108546234,2011-16-May,booked in here prior to a conference at the barbican- please check as it's a long walk from the barbican!! nice communal area allayed any fears however that was where the fun ended. A trainee checked me in (and when you read of horrendous queues checking in i can see why- there was no one else checking in and it still took him 10 mins) every other time i went to the front desk it was 8-10 deep awaiting check in allocated a room and was slightly apprehensive as it had a do not disturb sign as i swiped in.... thankfully the occupant had left however no-one had made the room! complaint to the desk eventually answered however i didnt fancy waiting whilst they cleaned the room for me! rest of the stay was equally poor- no-one answered room service on two occasions when i got through i was told it was 5 charge for a drink to be brought up no free wifi in the hotel at all Dinner was nice (buffet though so limited choice) decor of both rooms was shabby old and the carpets seriously threadbare- really poor example of a thistle,Geordie28
UR115377582,2011-15-July,Work booked this for me as part of an event at the Emerates stadium. Bottom line is it was 180 for a tiny single room no better than a good travelodge room and a shower fitting that was broken. Check in took ages and the location is a right pain quite a walk from all nearest tubes. I am sure there are redeeming qualities but for the price I paid view this as a poor choice even for London,Zenman1965
UR96732949,2011-15-February,We were booked into this hotel as >a spa day< as ;part of my daughters hen weekend. As soon as we checked in and put our luggage into our rooms the NINE of us headed straight to the spa. How disappointed were we to find that there were on two loungers between NINE of us. My first port of call to complain was the spa manager unfortunately he could neither resolve the matter or offer an apology or compensation. My girlfriends and I marched to the hotel reception in our towels!!!!!! and asked to speak to the hotel manager. The manager was no more help to us. Basically he said when people normally come to the spa DAY they just had a swim and there treatment and left. What a feeble answer and no help to us at all. As we were getting no where we accepted four bottles of HOUSE wine as compensation. In between talking to the manager the staff had put 7 conference chairs at the poolside (how lovely (not)). Do not use this hotel if you wish to concentrate on the spa. Also the spa was not clean and had a visible amount of chewing gum on the side of the pool. The only highlight of my time at the spa was the banter with the lovely Dave!!!!!! Go Dave!!!!!!,debina187049
UR118115244,2011-14-September,I'm sat in the hotel writing this review the hotel was booked for 290 GBP a night as it was a last minute company trip. I wouldn't pay 290 GBP for a month here here's why: The room is poor feels like I've landed in a bad 80's pastiche of a shabby hotel room The pillows are like stunted draught excluders I had to use a cushion from the bed to prevent neckache The internet has dropped out 3 times in an hour There are 2 lifts for the whole hotel I've spent a lot of time waiting for them It's not convenient for any tube station (go for old street) The lack of premium TV channels is disappointing (290 quid a night I'd expect sky sports I could get a years subscription for that) The staff are a bit weird it's like they've read the manual on what to do but don't know how to execute it I have silverfish in my room It's a shame that supply and demand mean this hotel will continue to exist and thrive and it doesn't deserve too. I feel embarrassed as a coach load of american's have arrived they will think this is UK hospitality. I'm sure the manager will respond with a professional and nice response to this that's a good touch but it's a bit late to be saying sorry afterwards.,matt_197821
UR115355116,2011-14-July,Disappointing in so many ways including ash in the soap holder in a non-smoking room booked for two - towels for one  broken TV remote generally grubby with lack of attention to detail.,HealwithSteel
UR119249700,2011-13-October,Not much going for this Hotel. It is not well located its not well appointed and its not wellcoming. The Hotel straddles a side street is not handy for the tube or bus routes. The rooms are small scruffy and not very clean. It is busy which is surprising considering the eyewatering rates. My advice is to look elsewhere although good Hotel accomodation at a resaonable price is hard to find in this part of London.,nearlydunroamin
UR100069716,2011-13-March,Weekend Break staff were excellent friendly and helpfull. Food was quite good with a good spread for breakfast if you don't leave it too late. Initially we had a standard room this was dirty and in a very poor state of decor too small with hardly any floor space we didn't even unpack and paid for an upgrade to a delux room. this had much more room and was definately cleaner but still not as clean and tidy as all the premier Inn's I have stayed in. The location is not that practical wilth the nearest tube 15 minutes walk away. Would not stay again which is a shame as the staff are so good.,chriscar0l
UR92797624,2011-13-January,We stayed in the Thistle City Barbican hotel on the 12th Jan 2011 room 1420 which was meant to be an upgarde as our room wasn't ready. We had booked through superbreak.com We found that the fabric coushions and seat base fabrics were clearly stained and looking very unhygeinic. We had booked a meal and theatre in the city so started to get ready when we finally got in our room. I found the water supply to be barely luke warm ast best so I contacted the hotel reception desk and they said they would deal withn the issue but I heard nothing. I telephoned again and they said they would remind the maintenance man. I gave up asking again as we was by now running late for a meal booking prior to our theatre booking. I had showered and my wife was now showering before the maintenance man knocked on the door. I explained the problem and asked him to check the supply at source as the water supply was good just cold. He said he would look into it. I also asked him to take the coushions away. I complained to the desk in the morning as my morning shower was axactly the same (Barely luke warm) They apologised and said they could not offer any financial compensation as I paid in advance through Superbreaks.com. I am really not happy with this service and I have to say I have never had to suffer such uncomfortable washing and Hygiene conditions in all my 51 years.,Gazzaboy1960
UR103909963,2011-13-April,I was in London for exactly 7 days and stayed at the Thistle City Barbican Hotel. When I arrived at the hotel you check in on the nice side but I didn't get to stay on that side. I was sent across the driveway to the (dark and cheap side) other building. When you enter the lobby of the 2nd building it's just basically an empty lobby with dirty floors. The size of the rooms are VERY small but I was by myself so I can live with that fact. This hotel has a LOT of kids (teenagers) staying in it at any given time. Upon closer examination of the room there was hair on the bathroom floor and on the bed. I tried calling the front desk but no one answered the phone. So I walked down to the front desk to request that room be recleaned and no one showed up that day. I went down to the front desk again in the morning explaining about the hair and requested that the room be cleaned properly and left for the day. When I got back to my room that evening the trash had been emptied and my bed made but the offending hair in the bathroom floor was still there. I tried calling the front desk again and got no answer. This is a common practice for them as I tried calling the front desk more than once to get a wake up call and no one answers the phone. So again I have to walk back downstairs to head to the front desk to ask that my room be cleaned. When I went back to my room to change clothes and head out again my foot went under the bed and touched something...GROSS! I get on my hands and knees to see what it was and it was a chunk of food just hanging out! Mind you the bed only sits maybe 1 - 2 inches off the floor so there is no way for the vaccume to reach underneith. This was more proof that I needed to know that the rooms were NOT being cleaned. It's just nasty! I got tired of asking them to clean my room and just kept my sock and shoes on after that. I don't know if it's standard practice in the UK for hotels to NOT have washclothes but the Thistle City Barbican has none. So if you stay here be prepared to bring your own washclothes and soap because the soap they provide smells like dirty feet! The only bonus about this hotel is it's a 10 minute walk to the underground!,MDtravelinglady
UR117967403,2011-12-September,I regularly stay in hotel accommodation and have never felt compelled to write a bad review until I stayed at the Barbican Thiste Hotel. Although the staff were very efficient and pleasant and the public rooms were of a good standard the bedrooms need refurbishment if they are to compete for business travellers in the future and I for one will not return to their chain. My room was on the front of the building and being in London I expected traffic noise but this was exasperated by the fact that I could not close my window. There was a problem with the window which kept dropping despite a maintenance man coming to close it. The draught caused me to wake up feeling cold. I had to resort to putting my extra clothes on the bed and to wearing a jumper! The bathroom tap was extremely loose and the whole room was uninviting and shabby looking. This is not acceptable and does not give the right sort of message to tourists and businessmen and women that visit our capital city - come on Thistle! The room cost 185 with breakfast - way over priced.,judithtravel_11
UR99908300,2011-12-March,I have stayed at this hotel 3 times in the last 3 months not through choice but through the selection of my company: Trip 1: Arrived at Old Street tube with my colleagues and had a 15min walk with luggage to the hotel. It's not in the best of areas but I didn't feel uncomfortable on the walk was just very conscious of walking around dimly lit streets with a trolley bag and a laptop over my shoulder. After trouble checking in (my company specified that everything would be invoiced but the hotel wanted a credit card unsure if this is the hotels fault or the booking company) i was assigned a twin room in the main building on the 4th floor. I battled with the key-card opened the door heard the noise of the wind coming through the gaps in the wooden window frames closed the door and went to request a different room. The staff were un-surprised and unapologetic I was then given a single room with an internally facing window. The room was dated but clean. Trip 2: Although I voiced my disapproval after my first visit the company booked me back in the hotel again. This time my colleague and I had a single room each in the annex building the corridors looked recently refurnished the rooms were not. The single room was TINY its clear that the reason they were single was because you couldnt physically fit a double bed in there (no exageration) there was a single bed a bedside table and that filled the width of the room the TV although nice to have a flatscreen was on a hinge so you could fold it out when watching it and fold it back to walk past. The room had an inward facing window again and paper thin walls. I called my colleague through the wall in the morning to make sure he was up and it actually woke him. Trip 3: This time i arrived with only negative expectations after previous visits. I am pleased to say that the girl on reception remembered me from my last visit im usually sceptical when hotel staff welcome me back as they can usually see ive visited before from the computer but she said welcome back before I gave her my name on checkin. I was given a twin room with 2 single this was in the main building and the room was a very good size again with an inward facing window but with a room that size i didnt mind. As with the rest of the room it was dated but clean. I had to laugh at the bathroom they had obviously refitted it in recent years and fitted a larger basin than was there before as I had to lean sideways as i was pooping because the basin was in the way. The rest.... There are 3 main choices for food and drinks: 1) the bar and restaurant opposite reception poor food every time although they were quick to offer free drinks when my colleague complained I wouldve preferred a decent meal though. 2) the bar by the lifts much better service polite staff and a decent burger (i assume it comes from the same kitchen as the rest of the food though). Nice decor and a big TV. 3) The chicken place on the corner outside the hotel typical chicken place like the place you buy your kebab from on a saturday night in town still better than what the hotel had to offer. Pool and "Spa" Does the job as a hotel pool incl steam room sauna and jacuzzi but dont book it just for a spa day you will be VERY disappointed.,BertieDastard
UR103603124,2011-11-April,On arrival they couldn't find the booking - that was because we were part of a group booking and it had been printed out and therefore removed from their system! Genius! Having battle the crowds of american teenage tourists to get into the lifts I finally got to my room. Apparently I had been upgraded - not sure from what - but it was an ok room - average cleanliness i.e. it looked tired and exhausted so was hard to tell if it was age or dirt but no overt signs of dirt. However it was the bed that was unbelievable. It was SO hard that I was unable to sleep at all. My other colleagues also complained about filthy bathrooms noise and dubious pillows. We were booked in for a 4 night stay but we all wanted to leave immediately - it was telling that independently all of us had packed our bags after the first night! We were booked through a corporate booking agent who persuaded us to allow the hotel to attempt to make amends and stay one more night. We gave them the benefit of the doubt but it was irretrievable (unless I got a new mattress I don't know what they thought they could do to improve it!) a third of the party stayed but the rest got transferred to another Thistle hotel - which was much more acceptable.,MistiLondon
UR121586827,2011-10-December,I have to work in London frequently and my normal hotel was unavailable for 2 nights this week so I was given the Thistle City Barbican hotel instead. Never again. The walk from Barbican tube station isn't too bad other than the areas you are walking through. On arrival the communal areas seemed reasonable and the lady who checked me in was friendly despite having atrocious levels of English and struggling to understand anything I say (which amounted to my name address yes and no). However once I stepped in the lift I realised that the lobby is a lightly polished charade. Battered and stinking of cigarette smoke despite the shiny "no-smoking" sign on the wall its last clean must pre-date the smoking ban. I arrived at my room to find it was tiny cold smelly and incredibly tatty and dirty. The carpet stained the furniture cheap and battered the bed small and the TV not working. I needed an iron so looked around and couldn't find one in the room. I read the guest services book in the room the yellowed food-stained pages told me there was an iron and ironing board in my room. Needless to say there wasn't. I called reception it was engaged I called room service and they put me through to reception and I asked for said iron and ironing board. This was at 9pm my intention was to iron my shirt and then go to sleep. They said they would send one up. At 10pm I called back and was told it would be on its way. I eventually gave up and went to sleep at 11pm - 2hrs later than I had anticipated and still with creased clothes. In the morning I woke up tired freezing and itchy to the sound of at least a dozen pigeons right outside my window - there were some flapping in the air as they couldn't find room to land amongst all their friend! I called reception once again this time it took 15mins for them to answer - I asked for an iron for a third time. This time it arrived 15 mins later I answered the door in my towel and the woman gave me a look as if to say - why are you answering the door undressed!? (I can't iron my shirt!!). The iron was next to useless and the ironing board was broken. It collapsed to its lowest setting and I resolved to ironing on my knees then going to work in a half creased shirt. In the bathroom I found the remains of someone's poo smeared in the bowl and the shower curtain had splodges of blood stained on it. I didn't have time to complain about any of this (for all the good it would do and the responsiveness of the iron request) and headed off to work. That night I stayed in the office until 11pm to avoid the hotel room for as long as possible. The food was out of my price range and given the levels of cleanliness and hygiene on display in other areas of the hotel I wouldn't have eaten it for free. My usual hotel costs 20 more than this but has free wifi. I had to pay 20 for wifi here so that cancelled that out. How 20 for 48hr wifi is justifiable in a major capital city in 2011 is beyond me. You'll notice the manager answers reviews on tripadvisor (and fair play for doing so) but they always always follow the same formula. Pick up something positive the reviewer said and spin it to sound like a compliment. On that basis you can fully expect mine to say "I'm glad you liked the reception area and found our staff friendly you rightly point out that we do have irons and wifi available in the hotel and local wildlife outside your window." The manager never refers to the state of the rooms. It's absolutely disgusting. I've stayed with no word of a lie in youth hostels in East Europe with fair better states of repair. Yet they have the nerve to charge people such significant sums of money. The crux of how bad this hotel is is how poorly maintained it is. In an ideal world the management would have a choice cut their prices to youth hostel standard or refurbish the whole builiding. The reality is that they are raking in cash for such an awful awful product they hardly care and no matter how many reviews on tripadvisor you try to answer if you don't care they may as well give up.,Hotelregular1984
UR53056111,2010-9-January,I have never reviewed a hotel before but felt compelled to warn others of this revolting hotel. There is NO WAY that this is a four star hotel. It doesn't even come close to some of the two-star rooms you can find in Bayswater. It's a trek from the city despite bring described as 'Barbican' and the surrounding area isn't very nice not that there's anything to see. Our room was dirty the wallpaper was peeling the ceiling was crumbling and the soft furnishings were stained. There was no air conditioning (just an old battered fan) so we were boiling hot. We asked to be moved to a different room and we were bruskly told that the hotel was full. In the en-suite bathroom the toilet didn't flush the seat was broken the door didn't open because the toilet got in the way and the sink had two hot taps (so no cold water - and on telling reception about the problem we were made to purchase water so we could have a drink). The glasses were dirty and the remote for the TV didn't work. Breakfast was a mediocre school dinner affair (in a freezing restaurant) so please venture out to one of the many lovely coffee houses cafes or restaurants in the city for a fraction of the price. Please avoid this hotel. Your money could be better spent elsewhere.,DrUKYorkshire
UR74418935,2010-9-August,Stayed one night in this hotel and will definitely not recomend nor return - the room I had was stuffy (cell like - aka hostel) no air con and unclean (or at least in need of new decor and a good scrub).,Pendlerjp
UR78824418,2010-8-September,My mother and I needed a hotel close to the local hospital prior to an operation so I looked up a selection of local hotels. The Thistle Hotels have a very impressive website and looked something special so I decided it was worth the HUGE expense. Having been persuaded by the booking staff to 'upgrade' to an executive room and having read about the great restaurants on offer I was optimistic about having a really special eveningprior to my mum having serious surgery the following day. NOTHING could be further from the truth - heaven knows what the standard rooms were like - the exectutive upgrade rooms had dirty wallpaper peeling off the walls threadbare and fraying carpets uncomfortable beds limited tea and coffee no minibar. AWFUL. We put a brave face on and went to find the supposedly very posh restaurant. OH MY GOD. Even worse - the 'restaurant' was not even private - right in reception no walls awful service (5 waiting staff) cold horrid food - and all horrendously expensive. I have stayed in hotels throughout the UK and the World and this was probably THE WORST experience I have ever encountered.,Dismayed_10
UR86374120,2010-8-November,I had to make an on-the-day booking for business in London and in hindsight I'm not suprised this hotel had availability. It cost 200 for a tiny room that was incredibly shabby. The room was horribly warm even though this was November. Opening the window wasn't an option as there was a very loud air-con fan outside that kicked in every 2 minutes making sleep almost impossible (unfortunately I'd forgotten my ear-plugs). Closing the window had little effect on the noise though. This was in the part of the hotel that is across the road from the reception. Never stay in that part of the hotel. Staff seemed friendly enough if a little weary of the criticisms and embarrassed. Terrible hotel for 60 let alone 200. Never stay there.,Hywel.Morgan
UR58080884,2010-8-March,I don't normally write reviews about hotels but after tonight's bar bill of 9.33 for a pint of orange (not even fresh orange) & lemonade I felt compelled to share my experience with the rest of the travelling world and hopefully if I can help one person to avoid this sad excuse of a quality hotel I will sleep easier in my uncomfortable single bed here at the Thistle Barbican. I will start my review by focusing on the good points as it would be unfair to be solely disparaging. The gym exists and the guys who run it are very friendly. Ok now the bad. The gym equipment is very well used and if you're hoping to use the pool/sauna get there early as there aren't enough padlocks (you need to ask for them at reception) to fit all the lockers. Surely some of my 175 a night could buy a couple dozen more from the local hardware store? I have been staying here for 5 weeks now on business (not by choice) and I have stayed on most floors. The rooms are along the lines of a Travelodge but less spacious and the fixtures especially in the bathrooms are bordering on broken. Sometimes you will get a radiator with no temperature control so take plenty of water to slake your 3am searing thirst. I can't deny the rooms are clean I know they get cleaned because I had a cleaner's sponge left next to my toothbrush last week. The sponge wasn't even new. Ok so how about the food? well breakfast is available and you must be seated by one of the ever changing members of staff. The food (for the added cost of 10 + VAT) includes bread that tastes like something from the value range of a leading budget supermarket concentrated orange juice out of a machine a handful of cereals oh and the coffee is the strongest coffee in the world. I added a quarter cup of milk and it had no effect on the colour. I like coffee strong but it was undrinkable. There is hot 'full English' food available but I've not had the urge to try it and probably won't. The thing that really pushed me to write this review is the bar. Ok so you're in a hotel not far from central London you expect to pay a premium. I tried the burger tonight it was nothing special although I paid 13.44 for the privelige (that includes the mandatory 12.5% surcharge). I washed it down with a nice pint of orange & lemonade that cost 9.33. Yes I too thought there was a mistake there 9.33 for a soft drink (no sparklers or umbrellas even) and so I did question that charge with the barman only to get the reply "that's hotel prices Sir". Needless to say I was greatful for the barman kindly enlightening me as I didn't realise I was staying in a hotel. What else oh yes the key card that you are issued with this will get erased for seemingly no reason so you will need to goto reception and get it re-swiped every 2 or so days if you can afford or have the masochistic tendencies to stay that long.,RobthePilot
UR60728727,2010-8-April,This hotel was booked for me by my company as I was attending a course in the City of London 24-26 March 2010. The nearest London Underground tube station is Old Street about 10 minutes walk. There were no signs for the hotel either which would help people that are unfamiliar with the area. My overall experience of the hotel mirrors many of the reviews by other people that have stayed here. My single bedroom was small extremely warm and very very shabby - not very inviting. The leisure facilities consisted of a very small gym (4 weight training machines 2 steppers 2 treadmills and one corner for free weights training one area fore stretching) pool area steam and sauna rooms. The service wasn't too bad but could have been better in places - my door card did not work on the second day and it took 3 visits to reception before the receptionist decided to accompany me to my room in order to resolve this issue although this was prompted by myself. Restaurant and gym staff were more helpful and friendlier. Food quality was okay with a small choice of main course meals but expensive for what it was. Whilst trying to maintain a balanced view I would advise fellow travellers to consider their options should they need to stay in this area.,brummiechinese
UR82394062,2010-7-October,I was charged 200 for a pokey single bedded room that had all the hallmarks of a 1970s student flat. Do not accept a room in the 'annexe'! Public areas are well appointed. Breakfast was bog standard buffet but the food was cold! I complained to thistle but have not had a response three weeks later.,card01
UR57986820,2010-7-March,I went to a search engine to look at pictures of the hotel this was a big mistake as it showed me the wrong thistle. I thought the building looked charming in the photo though as I said it wasn't our hotel. The many council blocks looked nicer than the hotel they surrounded I was quite worried what I had let myself in for. Now I was staying with my Gay friend so we were after a twin room however we hadn't specified this on the booking. When we went to check in she said they were running short on twin rooms so I said to her what makes you think we would like a twin room? She replied "Well you're two men." I considered leaving at this point but we were off to see a concert so I couldn't be bothered with the hassle of having to find another hotel. So she concluded her poor customer service skills in trying to force us to stay in two singles as they were running very short on twin rooms. I had to argue and finally she agreed to give us a twin room. Much to the surprise of having to walk outside in the cold to get to our hotel room we were greeted by a massive annual LGBT event in their conference suite maybe the lady who checked us in was receiving training later. Our room was awful and I was shocked to find that one of the beds wasn't made up therefor having to make the bed myself as I could not be bothered calling up the reception. The Radiator was so hot seriously if you're ever suffering with pneumonia in London then go the thistle it's probably a better idea than a&e. Anyway it's getting late. If I haven't stopped you from booking this hotel room already then I now urge; do not buy this hotel room.,torquaytonewcastle
UR66692087,2010-7-June,Me and my girlfriend have got good offer from our travel agency for 3 nights in this hotel. 4 stars and 100 per night in London - nice! Reality was not so nice... At first lady in reception offered us upgrading the room with nice view from window with mini-bar and with air-condition for 20 per night. I was surprised that in 4* hotel I have pay extras for having mini-bar and air-condition in my room but we wanted not pay more money and had taken pre-booked room. There was a nice LCD-TV and nice double-bed. That's all. No mini-bar and (of course) no refrigerator. View from window: wall in 10 m. No map with hotel information no pen no paper... Recycle bin in bathroom was broken and there was no brush for cleaning toilet. I hate that! About breakfast. The price of english breakfast was included in room price. The choice of meals was very poor and as a rule something was finished. Coffee had bitter taste but it looks normal in UK. If we wanted to change coffee with cappucino they asked from us 350  per cup without possibility to add the bill to our room-account! When I had gone to my room for taking the wallet they have made telephone call to our room that why they have to wait me so long time! OMG! On the One and only normal thing was the leisure centre underground of hotel. There is a swimming pool yakuzi sauna and steam-bath. The nearest tube station is ca 800 m (Old Street) and in other direction ca 1000 m (Angel) but they both are on the Northern Line so you have to change the train for catching heart of the London (Piccadilly Circus Trafalgar Square Leicester Square). Maybe the reason is so good price for 4 stars-hotel but hotel was full of guests and Sunday morning in restaurant was quit crazy. I am from Estonia and in our country in ALL hotels internet is free as a primary human right has to be. In this hotel they have wi-fi in rooms but excuse me! 15  for 24 hours... Thanks no!,tiiterr
UR74004091,2010-6-August,Do not stay this hotel. Period. First of all its miles from the city or and tube stop it is in the middle of a rough estate I would be wary walking around at night! Secondly the room was small dirty my light did not work the bath was only superficially cleaned so on a closer look around the taps etc was grimy they were handles missing and or falling off the walls. Overall poor room standard. The walls were incredibly thin and you can hear EVERYTHING from people on either side. I had particularly bad neighbours one came back drunk and mistook my room for his and tried to break my door down at midnight screaming to let him in! The people on the other side were having a mini party at 2am on top of that someone kept prank calling my room. I eventually asked to me moved at 2.30am and luckily they understood and moved me. The other room was fine still poor quality and the bed was old and lumpy I was then woken up at 6.30am by people next to me getting up talking and putting the TV on. I Left my room so quickly I forgot to brush my teeth in the morning as I was so desperate to leave. To top it all off they charged me twice for a one night stay and I had to ring up the bank etc to cancel the second payment!,lois_malfoy
UR63244292,2010-4-May,Similar experience to other reviewers. First room I got in the adjacent building to the entrance was awful. Stunk of paint had mould on the ceiling the wallpaper was hanging off window didn't shut properly so had a draft. All in a room that just about had enough space for a double bed but not enough to swing a cat. Complained to hotel and was told that there were no more rooms of that same standard however I could "upgrade" for a fee. Asked to look at it first. This was back in the main building and there was no problem with it so took them up on the offer but only because I didn't really have any option as I would not have been able to sleep in the original room. Perhaps its a little con they have to get you to upgrade cheap trick though. As I say the second room was fine. If I would have got something similar initially I would have rated the hotel a lot higher. Also wouldn't bother with hotel breakfast as there are a couple of cafes over the road that did an okay English fry up for less than a fiver.,rattlin
UR73743334,2010-4-August,This hotel should not be advertised as a 4 star we have stayed in better 2 star hotels. No one to help with cases. Outside our room 2423 there was a sewerage smell and the room was very small it was so hot and there was no air conditioning either. The carpet in the foyer of the 2nd building where our room was was all wrinkled up and the carpet in the dining room was a disgrace it was full of stains everywhere. The queue to be seated for breakfast was ridiculous this was at 8.30 the queue for the food was even longer. Then there was even a queue for the toaster which didn't even work properly my toast went through 3 times then it was only toasted on one side. This was reported to the dining room staff but there was no improvement the morning after. The tea was luke warm being served from flask like pots however after complaining about this we were served tea from a teapot. The hotel was very busy however the staff and hotel capacity were not able to cope at all. The staff in the dining room had no sense of urgency at all I asked for butter however the waitress finished clearing a table first! Over all very disappointing.,jltomo
UR60349117,2010-4-April,I have stayed here a few times on work trips as it is on the approved hotel list. However I would say that unless you get a very good deal I would be a bit wary of this hotel. The night staff were not helpful when I stayed and the queues to check in have been very long on more than one location. The rooms I have generally found to be okay it is all the extras that are lacking - one day I checked in and was told that breakfast was included in the price only to be told the opposite the next morning - very confusing! The location of this hotel is also not great unless you plan to get taxis in the evening - its an ok location to walk around in the day but too far from a tube for the evening...,HanD
UR65934119,2010-31-May,The hotel is not particularly handy for public transport and is in the middle of a dismal concrete low income area of London. The annex is a disgrace and needs urgent refurbishment. The walls are paper thin so we heard all of our neighbour's activities. The paintwork was tired chipped and flaking. The bedspread was faded. We were on the 2nd floor just above the canopy between the main building and annex. The noise from what we presume were the smokers from the Brasserie/Bar beneath was horrendous and went on until at least 2.30am. At the same time we could not shut the window because it was so hot and airless. We have stayed in Travelodges which are far better and less expensive. We suspected that rooms in the annex were allocated to those who refused to pay for an upgrade and this is a shabby ploy. Having seen the bedroom there was no way we would have contemplated eating at the hotel. The hotel seemed to be geared primarily to large group bookings. It is certainly not a romantic venue.,tmanddb
UR73168508,2010-31-July,Booked a basic double no breakfast (80 per night for the room 2 persons). Foyer large and glitzy. Got to the room (in block opposite) and it was clear we couldn't stay. Poky hot shabby no A/C (fan) grotty view nasty bathroom. Went straight back to reception and explained that the room was horrible and asked what it would cost to upgrade to something a little less revolting. Staff unsurprised (is this a marketing ploy to sell upgrades sending you to the room for naughty guests first?) and offered better room with AC plus free breakfast for an extra 20 per night (per room not per person). New room much nicer bit of a view etc etc. All in all ended up okay (just) but why have they got to play silly games like this? Next time I would look for a deal with a proper hotel like the Pestana Chelsea Bridge (or the Union Jack for all you ex-servicemen out there).,ayacastle1
UR88624224,2010-30-November,We were going out for the night in London and just wanted somewhere clean cheap and central for one night - I was not expecting much - just as well as this hotel could not be worse. We were in the old part of the hotel the room was tiny and despite the heating not working and there being no air conditioning plus the window was jammed open the rooms was still stiflingly hot (in the middle of November!). I imagine a prison cell is more luxurious although we are a married couple we were allocated twin beds the most uncomfortable I have ever slept in the bathroom was tiny and grotty there are no facilities at all and the whole place is utterly depressing. The area is not somewhere you would feel safe walking late at night and the service is non-existent. When I checked out I was not asked if I had a good stay - I suspect they stopped asking their guests that long ago as they already can guess the answer. Maybe the newer part of the building is better it certainly looks like it. We paid 120 which was a cheap deal through a consolidator I would say it is worth no more than 30 per night.,Areviewer2
UR66310184,2010-3-June,RECEPTION First of all they could not find the booking I had made via the internet. I was asked to sit while they tried to trace it. After half an hour they still could not find it so I booked another room at TWICE the cost just to get my head down for the night. The next day guess what - they found my booking so I got the refund which was due to me. ROOM I was put in the annex. The room was on the fourth floor and when I opened the door the heat blasted out at me. I tried to open a window but it had a stop which only let it open a few inches. On top of that there was a stack of air conditioning units and one kicked in and out all night. The room itself was tiny and in a bad state of disrepair. There were cables hanging out of an electrical bow over the door. The bath support rail was ripped of they wall. The door security chain had been smashed off and some really incompetent person had tried to fix it. Wallpaper was hanging off and a tile was loose in the bathroom. AREA Very threatening run down area. Would not advise walking in that area after dark. All the doors and windows in the nearby estate had metal grills attached to the outside of them. That certainly told me something about the area. I put up with it for four nights then went to Argyl Street at Kings Cross. There is a good choice of hotels from budget upwards. It also felt much safer than the Thistle City Barbican area,JimmyKK
UR85240631,2010-29-October,I had stayed at the Thistle Barbican for business a few weeks before -- I found the room a bit run down and not worth the money my company was paying but as London is expensive and this was short notice (and it wasn't my money) I did not complain. This time (again booked this hotel by my company) however the room seemed considerably more run down but again I did not have the time or energy to ask for a different room. I woke up the first morning to see dark spots on the sheets -- I tacked it up to old linen just another mark against the hotel. The next night I awoke to feel the sensation of bugs crawling on me and indeed when I turned on the lights there were bugs everywhere!! I even photographed one crawling on the ceiling. To their credit the hotel moved me to a suite immediately. They were only willing to reimburse one night however. This hotel is situated in two buildings. The building that is not attached to reception is very decrepit the carpeting is worn and dirty and my bug-infested room was in this building (as was my previous sub-standard room). The suite they moved me to was in the building with reception on the ground floor and this building in general seemed to be of a higher quality. I see that another guest had an experience with bed bugs here as well. If you must stay here insist to stay in the building that contains the front desk.,Gropius365
UR69106463,2010-29-June,Please spend your hard earned money elsewhere. The rooms are disgusting the staff are useless and unhelpful and it was genuinely the worst experience i've had from a hotel. Premiere inn put this place to shame!,hannah_apps
UR72902302,2010-29-July,Don't stay here if you think you will be in the city near a decent tube expecting sleep modern facilities or wanting value for money. Obviously it is the job of London Hoteliers to rob you blind in the summer months but staying here is like a mugging without the personal touch.,jimthefisher
UR88449017,2010-28-November,Booked this hotel on last minute.com for 2 nights. It was a top secret location listed as "Price Madness at hotel with Pool near Square Mile - 4* - London close to Europe's largest arts centre - the home of the London Symphony Orchestra - this modern hot minute.com as a secret hotel " It was one of the worst hotels I have ever stayed in!!! Its location is poor - middle of a housing estate Its cleanliness was poor - sink had hair in the plug hole and the towels were so thin you could almost see through them and you got 1 double and a hand towel between 2 people. value for money - advertised at one price but charged an extra 20 for the room we booked in the first place upgraded to "deluxe" what a joke!!! breakfast - 10.95 a head all served cold tea served in a thermos no choice and the beans tasted of burnt plastic. facilities - ordered a taxi from the hotel it charged 13 to covert garden when we had done the same journey the day before in a black cab for 8.,TIG60
UR59785967,2010-28-March,Ok where to start: Location no where near the city and the walk from the "nearest" tube station is not recomended late at night. Reception friendly on arrival however not the least bit interested in any complaints. Rooms this hotel must hold on to its 4 star rating by its finger tips. The was last decorated in the early 80's at a guess with beds of the same vintage. I understand that some rooms have been redecorated however do you want to take that chance? The TV was half off the wall with some wiring which while it might legal was pretty awful to look at. The lighting poor and the heating did not work. In short never again.,hehCheshire
UR88330821,2010-27-November,Booked an overnight stay at this hotel expecting a decent standard of accommodation. The room was shabby and in need of refurbishing & redecoratingwith bathroom fixtures hanging from the wall. The double glazed window wouldn't close properly making it a noisy room. A maintenance man attempted to fix the problem but couldn't. 164 for a tiny single noisy shabby room (2122) not impressed!,Moorlanders
UR54485370,2010-27-January,Although the staff were friendly the standard of this hotel is far below the standard i would expect for the prices charged. As i checked in i met a colleague who was already having to complain about the temperature in her room ( no air conditioning/climate control). Not a good start. I was booked into a deluxe room and was therefore suprised to find that not only was it tiny it was dusty and the temperature knob on the shower was broken so i ended up leaping in and out of the shower. Unfortunatly i was due at an awards dinner with only 45 mins to get ready or i would have complained and asked the manager to change things. In the morning i asked at reception what made a room 'deluxe' and was told that it might be more spacious. If this is the case then i dread to think what size a standard room must as there wasn't even room to move a chair in front of the desk *( thank goodness i was there for a dinner and not to work!) and the fittings were dowdy. Although they did write down my complaints there was no apology. If i had had more time i would have asked to see a standard room so i could compare for myself! Needless to say i don't reccommend this hotel to anyone as the ;deluxe' experience was terrible and as a consequence the standard experience must be trully horrific.,wockwabbit
UR57235892,2010-27-February,We arrived at 8.30 at night to find the hotel was turning away all Last Minute customers as they had overbooked the hotel. Only people who had paid the full rate were getting rooms. This despite having of course already paying for our room in order to secure it. We saw at least nine people sent away. Alternative accommodation was offered in Westminster which is useless if you have to be in the City early as we did. After a huge row we eventiully ended up at Euston. So at 9.30 we were put in a taxi to Euston and sat down to dinner just before ten.,DeborahSLymington
UR90772320,2010-27-December,In London for a week long business trip with colleagues. Stayed in the annex part of the hotel for the first couple of nights. Room was tiny but had what I needed - bed bath telly kettle. Ironing board fell off the wall first time I tried to use it but someone came to fix it quickly. After the first night I woke up with blotches all over my skin. I thought it was a reaction to the soap powder used on the sheets. Second night couldn't sleep as I was itching all over then I heard the pitter patter of tiny feet and a rustling in my bag. Yes I had a little furry friend sharing my room! I must admit my problem was dealt with quickly and efficiently. The duty manager arranged for housekeeping to move me to a 'deluxe room' in the main part of the hotel. They also cleaned out my bag and the few items that were left in there. He did offer to buy me a new bag but I'm not one to take the mickey. The deluxe room was a lot nicer with no extra visitors but I still wouldn't have called it deluxe or paid the price that they usually go for. Breakfast in the restaurant was good but a long wait for coffee and every day I had to ask for a teaspoon! Restaurant food in the evening was also nice but again the service was so slow. There were a few of us in my party and they always got at least one persons order wrong every evening. They were all very nice though. They eventually moved all of our party to the main hotel after someone else had a rodent issue in their room. After that we couldn't move through the lobby or restaurant without a member of management coming to ask us if everything was alright! I don't know if they were genuinely concerned or if they were worried about losing our company's business. Still they did go the extra mile those last couple of days. To sum up - rooms terrible food good service slow staff pleasant management helpful rodents plentiful!,MelonsUK
UR65412241,2010-26-May,The reception and public areas presented a nice image and I was looking forward to seeing if the rooms held the same promise. I was allocated a single room in annex building just across from reception on the 2nd floor. On entering the room two things hit me; the size and the heat! The room was absolutely tiny! The small single bed only just fitted. The bathroom was small and very dark with no light over the bath/shower so once the shower curtain was drawn it was extremely dark. To close the bathroom door you had to stand between the toilet and the bath. Free toiletries consisted of two small bottles of shower gel. Next the heat! it had been a hottish day and I entered the room at 8:30ish in the evening and the room was so hot. I even checked the radiator to see if it was on! There was no air conditioning but the window could be opened onto the central atrium - so there was very little breeze. There was an electric pedestal fan provided but this proved so noisy you couldn't hear the TV let alone leave it running to sleep. If this was a budget hotel then I would be less crytical but having paid 210 I found it a complete disgrace and a rip-off - even for London prices. I've stayed at the County Hall Premier Inn for half that price for a double room and that is 10 times better!,Marshwiggle
UR54443004,2010-26-January,freezing cold room asked them to check the heater that was not working they ignored me. breakfast is better in the local shops around the area that is strictly council flats and streets full of dodgy people. feels and is a rough area don't go out at night without taxi. woke up three times during the night because of gangs shouting outside. service? totally unconcerned they don't give a [--] avoid!,Smith8
UR72122747,2010-24-July,there were a group of us staying so the hotel made some serious money but what we recieved was disgusting - no better than student accommodation tiny single room was 199 per night (not including breakfast AND then paying VAT on top) the rooms were ridiculously hot the towels stank the single bed was not comfortable. there was a dirty cushion placed on my bed. the tiles were not clean in the bathroom. 4 out of 5 times i couldn't even get into the room using the key card and had to get help. one lift was not working so we all had to wait for ages for the one working one.,tracylouise77
UR59309596,2010-23-March,After a 15 minute walk from the nearest tube station a pleasant reception and reception staff allocating us our room or should I say our appendage to the lift. The room was miniscule having to walk crab like whilst ducking under the suspended T.V to encompass the bed. Mean while the lift floor bell constantly ringing. We were granted a room change which was to a slightly larger very tired room. The house keeper obviously missed inspection of the filthy windows holes in the duvet cover and the valance was half hidden underneath the mattress. Our included evening meal was appalling but the evening entertainment a plague of flies dancing around the potted plant situated next to our table distracted our attention from the quality of the food - not recommended. Breakfast was OK. Never to return.,WestieTyneandWear
UR90563208,2010-23-December,I stayed here on a hen weekend and I was HUGELY dissappointed!!! We staed in the annexe part of the hotel and it is very delipidated to say the least! I felt like the room was falling apart at the seams. The over blanket on the bed was filthy the bathroom had mildew and the ceiling had holes in it. We all had a spa treatment which was rushed and felt like a back tickle instead of a back massage. And then for the cockroach .... we came back from a night out in London and neatly nestled in the bed was a baby cockroach ... and you know what they say 'if there is a baby there has to be a mother!' We left pretty early the next morning so didn't get chance to meet the mother cockroach. Please I advise you not to stay at this hotel unless you absolutely have to and even then take your own cleaning products with you.,kezz43
UR76539101,2010-23-August,Stayed six nights. Room was small and shabby. Much of the chrome on the bathroom fittings had worn off and there was a foul odour from the sink each time I ran water. The bed was reasonably comfortable. There were long queues to get into the restaurant for breakfast even before 8 am. Even when you got a seat the table had often not been cleared. The food was generally OK but there were frequent shortages and the staff were too busy to serve you a drink. The situation got progressively worse the later it got. I would not stay again.,solo_traveller39
UR59240801,2010-22-March,arrived at this hotel on a busy friday afternoon reception bright and airy was given a room on the 6th floor when i arrived in the room it was twin bedded and i had requested a double room the funiture and decor was very shabby very poor facillities in the bathroom i phoned reception and explained that i had requested a double room they asked me to come to the reception desk whre I was given a key for a room on the 5th floor when I opened the door the room was much more what I had expected from this standard hotel the service at the restaurant was very poor to all in all i would not recommend a stay there,birminghambabe
UR56753990,2010-22-February,My husband took me to London as part of my Christmas. This hotel is a major let down although we tried not to let it bother us. The reception area is lovely but its all down hill from there. The rooms are really small for a 4 star and very basic. The radiator paint has all peeled off both radiators which look very dirty the seal around the bath was actually black most of the way round the base of the taps were filthy (a clean with a toothbrush could have fixed that). The tiles were cracked the fixtures were very poor the windows are badly in need of paint the "iron" which was a trouser press didnt work we were told on booking that we could have a late check out at at no extra cost as our flight wasnt until 10 at night - they knew nothing about this and charged us 10 per hour extra we eventually left and just went straight to airport and hung around there for hoursi could go on..... You also had to pay to use the swimming pool which i think is shocking. On the positive our breakfast was nice and well organised. We were pretty well located on the road round the corner we could get a 20min bus into Oxford Street which we used as our central point. most of the attractions are around that area. taxi cost around 7 to hotel from Oxford Street PLEASE DONT BOOK THIS HOTEL UNTIL THEY GIVE IT THE RATING IT DESERVES - HONESTLY IVE BEEN IN BETTER 2 STARS,t29dwn
UR62145212,2010-22-April,We were assured that there was a courtesy bus to the tube therefore we did not mind the distance to the tube station. However the concierge advised us in a very snotty manner that this did not run between Friday and Monday (when else would you require it for a weekend break) The rooms were very tired and grubby and the shower dripped all the first night and prevented a decent nights sleep. the drinks in the bar were super expensive (11 for a glass of wine and a pint of lager) go to the pub by the tube station where the same round was 5.,visitor095
UR71733036,2010-21-July,The room was small with only a single bed and although not very dirty the fittings were dated. The staff were helpful but this hotel is very over priced (over 100). A real disappointment and not worth the money.,Sly105
UR76183456,2010-21-August,After many years working in the Travel/hospitality industry i have never ever stayed in such a shocking place. Room 1123 avoid like the plague the carpet was stained frayed and thread bare the bathroom had someone elses toothpaste on the unit the shower tap was thick with grime and the tap was awful with limescale. The cupboards were missing handles the chair had holes in it dust you could write your name in was every where there was no chain on door for security and no radiator top. When we called down to reception we was just told to put it in writing they really dont seem to fussed no doubt they have to deal with these complaints all the time however for the price that they charge they should be getting it sorted!!! There is also lotsof roadworks which start up very early in the morning as well.We then spoke with the conceriege to book us on the courtesy bus back to the tube station which was ok we went down to get the bus at the designated time only to be told it was no longer available as the duty manager was using it!!!! I have lived and worked in 3rd world countries and their hotels and hospitality is far superior to this here.,buttons089
UR80284011,2010-20-September,My partner & I stayed here for a romantic weekend. It was a "mystery hotel" from a well known website so we didnt know the actual name of the hotel until it was booked. We then checked out the Thistle website and was very impressed. It looked awesome and even tho 94 seemed expensive we felt it was worth it. We soon found out why it was a "mystery hotel" as it was miles from anywhere and a long walk down some very dodgy looking back streets and area before we found it. All the local flats had bars and extra security gates installed. Not a good sign. Arrive at hotel and staff were polite. Room was terrible. We were in the main hotel but the room was shocking. Dodgy stains on the cover which goes around the bed the furniture was 80`s. The bath handles were all rusty loads of sealant everywhere paint had all faded and was yellow. Ive been in 2 star hotels better than this. The taps on the bath didnt work properly and no privacy with curtains drawn as about 8 other rooms all looked straight into ours. We looked at the prices for the restaurant and was amazed.. they were just shockingly expensive. Can of coke? 2.95! a Vodka & Coke in the hotel bar downstairs came to nearly 6! Even though the pool & spa were free and we packed our swimming costumes in anticipation from seeing the state of the room we just didnt bother using the pool or spa. Ive stayed in 4 star hotels all over the world and this easily has to be the worst. Thank god I was only staying there for 1 night!!!!!,jackinbox99
UR68112605,2010-20-June,I was charged 328.00 to stay in this hotel to be honest I have paid 9.50 for one night at a travel lodge which has been much better. The staff were very hard to understand as a lady on reception did not speak very good english. They could not find my booking which was booked via tickettree which was for a family room (2 adults + 1 child) they then said there were no rooms left and made us have a double room which was very shabby they then bought in a very stained single bed which made it very tight with no room to move. The room needed repairs - eg curtains hanging down marks to walls etc very battered furniture. I was appalled with the state that the single bed was in that they bought in - I would not let a dog lie on it. - brown stains all over it and by that I mean it was hard work trying to find a patch where there was not a stain.! When I complained the receptionist said they were full and could not put us anywhere else (that was by the third time that I managed to understand her english!) view from window was another window into someone elses bedroom. this has got to be the worst hotel I have ever stayed in and at 328.00 per night I found it a pure disgrace. If this is a four star hotel I will eat my hat!!! What was planned for my birthday and a city break for my family was wrecked by the standard of this hotel and what it cost. this hotel should be shut down - its apalling the hotel is in a run down area go by taxi if you go out at night its not in a safe area.,Sapphire169
UR71609161,2010-20-July,I last stayed here a couple of years ago and vowed never to stay again. Unfortunately I had to go to London on business and there was no other accommodation anywhere near the office. So... I gave it another go... My room was a double deluxe and was pretty horrid. Very old and tired looking marks all over the walls and chipped paint everywhere. The two chairs in the room had stains all over the upholstery - disgusting. I didn't look too closely at the bedding as I'd rather not know what lay beneath! My television remote didn't work and I had to use the controls on the side of the TV screen. I phoned for a replacement and was told a concierge would come up... he never appeared. I tried to order some room service no reply then left a message with reception who said someone would call me back. Eventually I managed to place an order and was told it would take 20-25 minutes 50 minutes later my food appeared. My meal was a bit hit-and-miss my Caesar salad as well as including all the usual ingrediants also had the added bonus of the big stalk bit from the lettuce and a huge lump of chicken fat - yummy! I visited the hotel gym which had the usual rubbish gym equipment stuffed into a room with poor air conditioning. The hotel pool did redeem it somewhat as the pool area is actually decent and has a little sauna and steam room. Given that this hotel is chock-a-block full of commuters and holiday makers I have no idea why they don't invest more in it and improve the service ten-fold. Or perhaps they feel they've a captive market that's not worth investing in. Really do not stay here it's grotty.,MintTea
UR81857535,2010-2-October,The reception staff were efficient but totally lacked even eye contact on arrival I was given a room on the third floor the reception staff failed to warn me that the place was like a rabbit warren the hallways all look the same and you can get lost just finding your room here Entering your room here was like stepping back to the 1970s I think they are still using the same fixtures and fittings anyway the room looked ok until I noticed that the T/v in the room was just for show it did not work the chairs were dirty and stained the bed mattress had a stain and the bathroom needed a good clean see photos of the shower taps and holders No Tea or coffee making stuff the towels were like sand paper and the room noise in the room was loud with the windows open the sheets on the bed were clean at least. The only good thing I can say about this overpriced Hotel is that the bar staff (although very busy due to the amount of people in the bar proberbly could not sleep ) were indeed friendly and a true asset to this hotel.,SteveTheRanger
UR63049751,2010-2-May,Words cannot adequately describe how bad this place is. Unfortunately I checked out before I though of taking any pictures. Take my word for it - seen 3 different types of rooms - one in the main building and 2 others in the adjoining building - horrible ! Pealing wallpaper damaged furniture mould on the toilet ceiling dirty carpets..... - forget it ! Take my advice and go elsewhere. No one should have to pay for something like this - an absolute disgrace. After what I had been shown I decided not to stay even 1 night.,gotogo
UR57565890,2010-2-March,I thought Thistle hotels were of a certain quality. Boy was I wrong. The first cell they gave me was like a sauna. The large radiator was red hot and when I tried to turn it down the valve just fell to the floor. It was balanced on the pipe. When I went to the reception to tell them they called a maintenance man who offered to come and turn it off with his wrench(he obviously knew what the problem was before he was even told). He said I had to get him to come to my room every time I needed the radiator turning off/on. I managed to get another room which was even smaller and stank of damp. By this time it was late and I just wanted to go to bed. I will never stay on this hotel again. Rooms are grotty dated and very unappealing.,EssexSoulboy
UR64463939,2010-18-May,Very welcoming on arrival concierge & staff helpful. The room was clean warm & reasonably comfortable but "tired" and in need of decoration. The bathroom also was in need of a makeover. Breakfast was chaotic. We were there 2 nights and at breakfast there were never any butter knives or tea spoons on the table. The buffet regularly ran out of plates...at least 3 times in 2 days...the food was not hot due to it being cooked in bulk & left out for self service and you have to wander round to find a waiter in order to get a cup of tea or coffee and then I had to get milk from the cereal bar as the jug on the table was empty. Dont be tempted to drink at the bar here. 2 x 1 pint glasses of orange juice made with lemonade cost 13.74 !!! Rip off or what?? Alsothe location is not the best. Walking in the area after dark is un-nerving to say the least. Best to use a taxi. This hotel was booked as part of an all inclusive theatre break. If it had'nt been I would'nt have paid the normal price this place tries to charge.,JohnandSyl
UR67865723,2010-18-June,Book early get the discount rate. The website requires a very good internet connection or it will not work. The staff is OK the breakfast was OK the room was OK. For the price I expected better than 'OK'. The concierge was the very helpful. When asked about walking around the area at night - he hesitated and responded "Well this is London it might not be a good idea" The room was small the view was non-existent (see pictures). The bathroom was a bit cramped the sink intruded on the toilet. The water pressure was weak the shower was not very strong. If you can get a discount rate this is worth the stay - otherwise do not bother. Do not pay for breakfast it is not worth it and there is a bakery across the street that is very good and less expensive. There is also a laundromat across the street next to the bakery if you need to wash clothes.,javamike9
UR75819768,2010-18-August,This hotel is absolutely disgusting. My room had old tatty wallpaper and lots (and lots) of stains on the walls. and carpet. The room was tiny - the smallest and dirtiest I have ever been in in 14 years of travelling on business including many trips to Lithuania Belarus Latvia and Estonia. Everything is the room was dirty and a lot of things were sticky. The TV remote was covered in clumps of sticky brown goo (God alone knows what is was). The room was very dark and there wasn't mch natural light so no way of improving matters. There was a distinct smell of urine in the room - it didn't come from the bed so I simply slept on top of the bed (the sheets were heavily stained so didn't want to sleep in them). There was no aircon and the room was roasting with no way of changing the temperature. The bed itself was stained and I'm not 100% sure if it was actually made since the last people were there. I was a guy travelling on his own and was shattered after a very early start so just crashed out. However if I had my children in this place I would have left immediately as I would have been concerned that they would catch something (that is not a joke). There was a damp stain and mould in the tiny bathroom. Also the sealant was coming away from the bath which made it look even sleazier. The toilet was cracked which made you worried that if you used it it would flood the bathroom. My (solitary) towel was ripped but trust me that was the least of my problems;-) The door to my room didn't swing shut you had to give it a hard shove. If I hadn't realised this I would have lunwittingly eft my room with the door unlocked. Also you could see at the lock that the door had been forced open sometime before (I wonder why??) There was pipework in my room and fixes that resembled bad DIY projects. There is no way this is a 2 star hotel far less a 4 star hotel. There was no mini bar in my room and not enough plugs (which is what you'd expect from 4star places). Any Travel Lodge I have been in is a million times better than this place. I did smile at my iron cupboard. It had no ironing board....or an iron. Just the broken fittings for them in an empty cupboard. The location is not good. It is in the middle of a council estate and there were several groups of youth hanging around drinking when I went out (7.00pm). There were shouts and screams till about 3.00am (nothing dramatic - just drunken teenagers doing their things but it does keep you awake). It is not near a tube station. It is not near any nice bars cafes etc. Check in took 15 minutes with a grand total of 3 people in front of me. HOWEVER..... the reception area looks pretty smart and clean (so if you're a big fan of tidy receptions ......;-)). AND.....the gym is clean although small and got overcrowded quickly Overall this is a disgusting horrible hotel. If you're thinking 'I'll give it a go anyway' so be it but under no circumstances take young chldren to this hotel - they will get ill; you will hate yourself.,belmontdon73
UR56236854,2010-17-February,I booked this hotel with Lastminute.com for a weekend away with my husband. When we arrived reception were extremely slow at checking guests in. The room we were assigned was in the "other" part of the building and even though it was clean it was old and worn looking. The major complaint we had about this hotel was we were given a twin room. When we asked repeatedly to be moved to a double room (with a double bed) we were told by the staff that they couldn't move us as the hotel was fully booked and as we booked with 'lastminute' we had to accept what we had been given. They said they would see about moving us the following night but with no guarentees. We had to make do with single beds that night but discovered the following morning that there was no hot water for showers. Again we asked at reception about moving rooms to be given the same response ... you booked with last minute! Eventually after asking 4 times at about 3pm that day they agreed to move us. The second room was lovely and if we had been there the first night I would have had no complaints. I get the impression with this hotel that there are 2 levels of services in two parts of the building! We definitely felt like we were treated as 2nd class citizens as we didn't book directly with the hotel. I would be very cautious about booking with them again.,sarsbuck
UR64207124,2010-15-May,I have stayed here on two occastions for two nights each. The bathrooms are really old and broken. The window almost fell out of the wall when opening and was really dirty. Rooms are small and old. This is really no four star hotel where you should pay 120 Pound for 1 night for. Only for 70 Pounds I would sleep there. I need to mention that I was in the second building and not the first so maybe that one is better. It also is a 15 minute walk to the oldstreet tube station.,WiersDelft
UR70978673,2010-15-July,I booked this hotel through work and paid 100 for a one night stay. I would have made a complaint if I'd paid myself. It's the only time I have stayed in a hotel and been disappointed with the room. My colleagues room was the same so it wasn't just a one off. I wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone. My room was freezing but my colleagues was too warm and she couldn't sleep. The bathroom was old and in a bad state of repair. My colleague had an invoice for 99 shoved under her door at 4am even though she had prepaid (possible scam?). There was a queue to be seated at breakfast so not good for people needing to be somewhere early. We also had to ask for coffee as our table was ignored. A bad experience all round.,MEAD46
UR86980897,2010-13-November,Don't think this is going to be a ok stay because it won't be. I stayed here in November 2010 and I was shocked about how bad the hotel was. I have stayed in many hotels but this deserves 1 star. I've stayed in better hostels. Trust me I'm used to bad hotels this is terrible. The worst I have ever stayed in.,smiddyy3k
UR70825091,2010-13-July,Good points: Checking out!! A fine selection of p**n channels Bad points: Wall's are thick with dirt (you can leave handprints) Towels are rough and smell bad Poorly lit room with only bedside bathroom and mirror lights Unchanged sheets with sexual residue Mouldy dirty and damp ceiling panels with holes inside No instructions for use of phone Hairdryer is awful with only 1 setting Have to cross road to get to reception Damage to customers personal belongings and a considerable amount of money missing after a visit from the maid. Breakfast would have tasted better if the brown sauce was dog [--] Dirty knives Lack of British staff There was an underlying smell of [--] in the bathroom... When a member of our party asked for a caffeine-free drink the waiter replied "coffee??" Me and my wife had to push the two single beds together on our wedding night (after specifically requesting a double) we are currently considering a divorce after 2 nights,Joelywoley
UR86845350,2010-12-November,Fortunately I only had to stay one night in this terrible hotel. The room was dirty large areas of wallpaper were peeling off there was graffiti on the walls cables dangling the curtains fell down when I tried to draw them and the bathroom was something out of the 1950s with mould broken taps and a missing plug on a broken chain. I arrived late and had to eat dinner in their restaurant as I did not want to risk walking about in the rather run down looking immediate area. The meal matched the room - substandard terrible service too expensive. In short this hotel does not merit its rating in any way it's overpriced and substandard I've stayed in better 1* accommodation !,SBeaumann
UR63923266,2010-12-May,This is a terrible hotel located in the middle of a low income area which makes it unsafe to walk back late in the night. My room was in the dependance and very cold tired and noisy: being on the corned winds were strong and woke me up several times in the night. Breakfast management is cahotic with long queues as restaurant too small to accommodate for the overall number of rooms available in the hotel. In the dependance many meetings are organised on a daily bases and security remains a concern given that anyone can wonder to the crammy corridors via the fire escape stairs - if you venture there close your eyes as they have a tendency to park there for a few days dirty trays from room service.,NanoPelato
UR83043924,2010-11-October,Definitely not 4 stars! I booked a double room for two nights for my boyfriend's birthday and was very disappointed by the room. My boyfriend had arrived a little before me and had checked in. He immediately upgraded the room paying 20 pounds for the privilege. As a previous review has written this must have been in the 'old' part of the hotel. I only got to view the upgraded room which was still very small had holes in bedsheets from wear an old cathode ray tube TV and bathroom with dusty polystyrene ceiling tiles and no vent. The curtains and bedspread and room decor was a confection of some garish yellow and red pattern which did not soothe matters. The hotel is also about half a mile from any tube station and is located in the middle of nowhere (yes despite being in Central London!) My boyfriend had a quick lunch upon checking in before I arrived and despite having already checked in and having asked if the meal could be added to our room bill we were subsequently ordered downstairs from the 4th floor to pay our bill immediately! What is the point of having a room bill? There is also an extra 5 pound charge for any room service so don't bother. Only plus point is the McDonald's within walking distance! Do Not Waste Your Money!,InMyHonestOpinion
UR53207298,2010-11-January,I think 100 % people on this hotel agree on the same thing and that is the reason of this hotel having more terrible reviews than any other hotel I have been in my entire life and this includes some of them in countries like India Turkey China etc....If the management of this hotel would rate it as it really deserves Hostel or maybe one star they would not get such a poor score which might be record on trip advisor. I got thsi hotel using last minute and in the last time or minute I used such a site. They do fake publicity like in the case of this hotel which they rate at 4 stars They fool me once fair enough but they lost a customer for life and I will make sure that my relatives friends and anyone I know never ever buy anything in last minute. As soon as the name of this hotel came public to me and I came here I went straight to cancel it and the answer was as expected no refund at all...no joke I am not surprise only fooling people you get this hotel busy because otherwise someone has to be desperate or crazy to stay there. I would recommend better a Hostel or a B&B at least they are honest and they tell you their real rating. There is one more thing I do not understand the comments about the neighbourhood it might not be vegas but it is not what people are describing it is safe and very close to old street tube station. The place for breakfast close to the hotel will get your smile back after the thistle experience...If you still want to go here good luck....,gaditano
UR74720004,2010-11-August,I stayed at the Thistle barbican and in the 2nd night I woke up to find myself covered in bites. I realized that the bed was full of bed bugs. Filthy place! How could that be possible? In London in a supposedly 4 start hotel in the city? I can only think that they do not clean properly an do not change sheets between 2 guests. When I informed the staff they did not believe me. I had to show the bites. Absolutely disgusting! Avoid the place if you can.,YMAX
UR89507112,2010-10-December,Stayed in the hotel Dec 2010 I was put in te detached part if the hotel in a rooms only section away from the main hotel the corridors are shabby and old the room was basic to say the least and the bed was a single. Very hard pillows and windows that dont seal properly makes for a sleepless noisy night I won't be back.,tools99
UR69311446,2010-1-July,Dear All If you are thinking od staying in this hotel dont. I stayed there this week for one night only with 2 colleagues they felt the same about it as i do. For my work i travel all the time so i am used to a wide variaty of hotels worldwide this is one of the worst ever. I shall list why you can then decide yourself. - not clean. - no airco bad smells everywhere - uncaring staff - very small rooms vastly overpriced no service at all no minibar no glasses allowed in rooms??? walls made of paper you can hear everything this place is the pits do not stay there you will regret it i did not check the hotel on this site beforehand and i regret not doing so.,xavier030
UR50970425,2009-9-December,I can honestly say that this was one of the worst hotels i have ever stayed in. The check in took forever the staff were unhelpful and the hotel is in the middle of what seems like Harlem. The hotel needs a splash of paint and an update urgently. I can't believe this is supposed to be a 4 star hotel?! The food was bad breakfast was bland. i waited 30 minutes just for a waiter to pour me some tea. Don't stay here! Go to Travel Lodge instead! Better value for money. This place should be closed down!,charliecrossway
UR48781483,2009-8-November,From the moment that my colleague and I arrived we were shocked by the poor level of service that we received. Having been spoken to with complete disregard by the receptionist I went to the room that had been allocated. To my horror after this room was already occupied!!! On our arrival back to the receptionist I explained what had happened - she looked me up and down and forced out a heartless apology. I was informed that there would be another room made avalible for us. During the long wait for the second room allocation a couple returned to the reception desk to say that the same thing that happened to them too! Please do not leave any belongings of any value in your room as the next people may not be as honest as I! The Dulux Suites are very basic and not what you would expect at all. If you plan on staying here do so without any expectancy of actually going to sleep - the beds are shockingly uncomfortable and the noise in the hotel during the night is exceptional!,OxfordOxford11
UR31833693,2009-8-June,Dont be decived by the done up reception area! We were placed in room in the far corner of the hotel! Damp ceilings in the corridors old fashioned stuffy rooms! The shower trickles so you have to spend at least 30 mins to get a good wash! Awful office stile tile ceilings! A friend had stained sheets! The best thing about the rooms were the flat screen TV's which were oddly placed in each old fashioned room! The walls are paper thin and the rooms get extremely hot! The hotel is located in the middle of council estates and is really quite far out and its a 20 min taxi drive to Oxford street depending on traffice. Staff werent overly polite or helpful throughout or stay. The day manager was the most helpful of all after I had to make noise complaints on two evenings after being woken up at 1:30am on both nights from really noisy screaming guests in the room next to me! And prank calls from school children staying in the hotel! The Breakfast wasnt great either! A bottle of water will cost you 2 from the bar! Me and my friend we had a complimentry upgrade to a "Deluxe" room the difference between the rooms was that we has air-con no longer the gross office ceiling in our bedroom decor was brighter and we got a few more inches on the flat screen tv! In regards to the Swimming pool spa area- its only open to guests at certain hours many days of the week were closed for swimming lessons! All in all very overpriced for what it is and the experience has definetly put me off staying in a thistle hotel again!,likesposhhotels
UR46124600,2009-7-October,The room was not in the main building but adjacent and despite the contemporary public areas the bedroom was small and very outdated screaming out for refurbishment especially the dismal bathroom and my companion said the beds wouldnt look out of place in a prison. The corridor layout is also a bit of a labyrinth. There was no lock on the bathroom door and the plug didnt work meaning you have to continually top up the bath. The heating doesnt work and the locks on the window were broken. Toiletries were minimal and not refreshed not enough towels and no spare pillows which isnt helped by the staffs lack of English. I have stayed in many hotels and they can be noisy so I always come prepared with ear plugs but the paper thin walls here were comical. You can hear absolutely everything. Luckily we were travelling with the people in our next room and we actually made our travel arrangements for the evening by talking through the joining wall! The hotel is very much away from all of the London action and the area was dead at the weekend. As with any city centre hotel dont use the expensive hotel cars you are less than a minute away from the main street and licensed black cabs. It wasnt atrocious but Im just glad I had such great company to detract from the above.,luxurytraveller21
UR31817263,2009-7-June,do not stay here i awoke in the morning to find a mouse sitting on my clothes I had to be moved to another room to get changed. The manager only offered me a 30% discount on the bill this hotel is a joke.,JanetteD
UR23338862,2009-7-January,work booked me into this hotel which was meant to be pre-paid for needless to say it went wrong from the moment i entered their building. despite as stated work pre-paying for the room the room wasn't paid for. after much arguement with ignorant staff who were unwilling to help i went off for some food. the receptionist even called over the supervisor who basically shrugged his shoulders and walked off very helpful. i enquired prior to travelling when they stop serving hot food as i knew i would be checking in late (10-11pm) again asked receptionist where i could get some hot food only to be told the restaurant was closed no hot food was available. then she went onto change her story after i mentioned i had rang to confirm that hot food was available from another bar. off i went to the bar had burger and chips which was ok but pricey i accept this as its london. ok tired by this point so off to my room i go open the door flick the light switch no lights fumble around looking for a key power slot thingy nothing try other lights using mobile as a torch nothing. called the desk to be told there's a master switch at the door. ok i thought. i couldn't find said switch tried calling back no answer. went to see the concierge who was very poilte but not really wanting to help the fact he asked me if i could wait as his paperwork was very important annoyed me. we went back to my room he checked the fuse box it had tripped out but was locked so nothing he could do. back to the desk we go eventually get offered a new room a better one at that deluxe i believe they called it. new room was fine very dated lots of old red wood etc. wouldn't agree with "deluxe" though. went to check out still wouldn't accept that the room was pre-paid for. so i paid for it. i wouldn't recommend this hotel ever.,t121anf
UR50831088,2009-7-December,Very disappointed with my stay. Waited over half an hour to get a drink at the bar the rooms were tiny and hot and breakfast was a shambles - never again! The spa consisted of 1 tiny jacuzzi a small pool a cramped sauna and a dangerously hot steam room! Not the relaxing time I'd anticipated!,K122009
UR34040653,2009-6-July,I'm afraid I'm joining the many negative reviews. Having never written on trip advisor before and normally very satisfied with basic hotels I feel forced to vent my frustrations. I'll keep it brief but the room was about 40 degrees with no air conditioning available. There was a plug in fan which I had to leave whirring all night to get any sleep. The cold and hot taps in my room both poured out scalding hot water which made having a glass of water and a shower very unpleasant. The staff were polite but incredibly unhelpful. When asked if I could have some sort of breakfast sent to my room even a croissant or bowl of cereal would have been fine as I had to leave before 6:30am I was led around in unhelpful circles for an hour. Eventually when I had fallen asleep a man knocked on my room with a lunch menu and no way of me ordering anything at which point I gave up. I was also charged 2 for a small tube of toothpaste which I had to extract from a vending machine. When I pay 132 for one nights accomodation I don't really expect this. Basically I really wouldn't stay here again if you paid me which is pretty bad considering I was only there for one night and normally stay in much cheaper hotels.,cazzarini
UR48573168,2009-5-November,I feel sure that the cost of a room in this hotel could be better spent elsewhere. As others have noted the hotel needs a lot of TLC - it is decidedly shabby. The room we were in was tiny and had all the signs of lack of care (rust on the radiators hole in the bathroom door etc.). It was the smallest hotel room I have ever stayed in (and I have stayed in convents!). We nearly fell over each other getting into bed. The bathroom was not well-appointed. The shower was very old fashioned and the bath was only for ladies size 12 and under. For the price it is a long way from the main attractions too. Plus factors: the bed was comfy and the water was hot.,Hakluyt
UR36801673,2009-5-August,Atrocious firstly this hotel is in the middle of nowhere you need a taxi just to get to the nearest tube station. Upon arrival they couldn't find my booking and took 30 mins to check me in blaming my companies booking agent but then reported me to the booking agent for not showing up despite me having the misfortune to stay here for two nights! My room was tiny and scruffy there were builders lamps lighting the corridor the maid left my window wide open onto a low roof in the central area of the hotel so that anyone could have helped themselves to my belongings I couldn't get an outside line and my wife couldn't ring in my TV wouldn't work and despite ringing reception they wouldn't answer and when I went down to the front desk I found the staff talking and ignoring the phone. To add further insult I had booked an early morning call which never came resulting in me turning up late for the meeting I had travelled to London for in the first place. I wouldn't return if they paid me.,ScouseWashingtonDC
UR48482654,2009-4-November,Nice staff but tatty and poorly equipped rooms. Had to spend 5 minutes trying to close the window and when I finally achieved that challenge there was still a draft and it was still noisy. And speaking on noise the walls are as other correspondents have mentioned paper thin. Mind you the couple in the room next to me seemed to enjoy their stay - trust me I could hear every word (and more) so I know they enjoyed themselves. The room had a built in ironing board but it was so ancient it was on a 90 degree slope. Extreme ironing! I grant you it was cheap but cheap as in cheap not as in good value. And by the way its in Clerkenwell which I suppose at a push could be described as the 'City' but only just......,TeignmouthRed
UR36701413,2009-4-August,stayed for 2 nights at the weekend check in took over 30 mins and nearly got shunted to another hotel as they didnt have room requested room was shockingly dated window jameed down and couldnt opensafe didnt operatedoor hanging off iron cupboardshower sprayed water all over the bathroombath handle hanging offtoilet flush barely flushed!! bar prices expensive even by london standards. cost over 100 a night for room only avoid!!!,bottleirnbru
UR45499616,2009-30-September,My wife and I prebooked a De-luxe double room. We expected a 4 star standard but got a room more appropriate to a hostel. The wallpaper was stained in places grimy all over and peeling. There were soot stains on the ceiling above the wall lights. The carpet had threadbare patches and the chair was badly stained. There was no toilet paper and just one towel for the two of us and the ceiling light in the bathroom did not work. We could not book breakfast as the computer was not printing. Vouchers were promised but never materialised. In the end we went to a local cafe for an English breakfast. Good food and excellent value at 4 compared to 15 in the hotel. The hotel staff were fine but the management needs to redecorate the bedrooms if the hotel is to be worth the rating that it claims.,simonsaysNottingham
UR48400170,2009-3-November,Just don't !!!! Dirty noisey  you could hear the occupants in the next! rooms breathing nevermind snoring all night ! bathroom filthy broken cables light switches holes in carpet also dirty.  smelt of very bad drains.,HantsLucy
UR29228583,2009-3-May,We booked a twin room through lastminute.com but when we arrived at about 3.30 to check in the hotel clearly had no record of it and left us waiting the best part of an hour in the bar area to sort it out - after having quizzed us about our evening plans and obviously having decided they couldn't convince us to move to another hotel. Eventually we were given a room and told we were upgraded to a DeLuxe Twin to compensate for the wait but when we got into our room it was a tiny double room with a single bed shoved in the corner. The furniture was old and shabby the glasses were not clean (lipstick!) the aircon was off so the room was sweltering and there was no remote to switch it on. Reception said they'd send someone to fix the aircon but when we returned three hours later nothing had been done. I went to have words with them about it and they tried to fob me off with 'if you are going out this evening it will be working by the time you come back' but I demanded someone do something about it before we went out. 15 minutes later they had given us a remote and it was working - but all this hassle in a 4 star hotel??! I will be writing to request at least a partial refund and will let lastminute.com know too as other people who had booked through them were in the same boat as us with the hotel 'not being able to find' their booking. If you want a stress free comfy stay in London then avoid this hotel like the plague!,ScullyFX
UR36039017,2009-28-July,Only just seen all the other reviews I stayed with my husband in January to attend a party locally. Our room was tiny barely any ventilation. The heating rattled and shook & could not be controlled. There was one usable plug socket stuffed away under a desk which was too far away to use and if you wanted to boil the kettle the Tv had to be unplugged first. The room badly needed decorating maybe turned back into the cupboard it once was! The bathroom was as if it too had been adapted from a cupboard a small cupboard the sink overlapped the toilet and you could barely turn around in there.NEVER AGAIN!,krint
UR47716822,2009-25-October,Having read the reviews i decided to stay at this hotel because it was fairly near to where i wanted to be and Lastminute.com had a deal which was 50 a night cheaper than Thistle direct (they refused to match!). On arrival I was impressed with the look of the lobby and thought perhaps the hotel had been refurbished since some of the negative reviews. Agreed to upgrade from a single standard to a deluxe double for 25 a night as still cheaper than booking direct. Only 1 lift was working and it looked very old and rickety. came out on the third floor and again wa simpressed with the oppulent marble and egyptian statues. stuggled to find room as you have to head down one of the two corridors before you find the room number signs which are then very difficult to read as are transparent. went into the room whilst it was okay it felt small and oppresive with a window only out to an internal area which appears to be the same for the majority of the rooms. It was odd that the room looked to have been refurbished but was still grubby with marks on the walls it did not feel clean. Very dissapointing given i upgraded two levels so glad i did not stick with the single which from other reviews appears to be similar to a room from rising damp. I wnet back down to ask for a different room without too much fss was offered a room on the 5th floor but again it was an internal window was even smaller and the sink had a huge crack in it. went back down and this time found someone who could work out which rooms had an outside window as i had requested. He 'upgraded' me again and this time i accepted the room as it was a little large with a proper view but the sink also had a huge crack in it and things like tissues laundry bags etc missing. All in all paid around 400 for 3 nights which might be cheap for London but would not stay here again. Nearby would recommend Malmaison if you have a bigger budget or just find a travel inn as at least it will be clean and new!,AW&LW
UR33113993,2009-25-June,This is definitely the worst hotel i have stayed at in London and i stay there pretty much every week. I have not ever felt sufficiently compelled to write a review like this so please take note. In summary: 1. Location - if i did not know London very well i would have been intimidated to walk around the area as the hotel is basically situated in a rough council estate and definitely not in the part of Clerkenwell that you might be familiar with 2. Room v small and stuffy with no air conditionining or ability to open windows. Also random cover up paint all over walls and door - worse than a student house; 3. Walls are paper thin and i could hear coversations from rooms on all sides. This combined with various noises of fighting etc from outside made sleeping impossible; 4. The desk in the room was torn and splintered to add to the fact that there was no free internet; made it difficult to work; 5. I requested an iron no less than 3 times before someone finally came back to me to say that none were available until the morning making it very difficult for me to have a shirt ready for an early meeting; 6. The bathroom was shabby and the mirror located about 4 foot from the basin which made shaving very tricky - and no shaving mirror. I could go on but compared to most of the other hotels i have stayed in in London at a similar price this place is an absolute pit. Mr Thistle you should be very ashamed. Thinking about it the only hotel which even comes close to being this bad is the Thistle Westminster there is a trend here i believe! Adam Baddeley,badders74
UR25040595,2009-23-February,Glad I took the room upgrade (which they offer everyone) or I hate to think what the standard room would be like. Not the best area to stop in London. We had to stand in a in a long line for 25 minutes to get a cold breakfast. Even the fresh food from the kitchen was only luke warm. good entertainment watching the manager getting a telling off from a few of the guests,smarty740
UR49745974,2009-21-November,We stayed here for one Saturday night as part of a Daily Mail theatre break. The location of the hotel is quite unbelievable right in the centre of a big council estate therefore we did not feel comfortable walking from the hotel to the tube so had to get taxis everywhere. The general location of the hotel is not central to anything which was disapointing. On arrival it took us forever to check in (not sure why the receptionist found this task so difficult) and we were given rooms on the 2nd floor. Apart from the marble reception this hotel is very drab and the rooms were no better. We had booked three rooms all of which were tiny (the bed took up the whole room) with very poor decor a view of an internal roof they really are in need of a refurb. We had a couple of encounters with the staff all really unhelpful everything you ask is too much trouble for them. We had breakfast included in our rate the cooked breakfast was very bland I would have cried if I had paid 15 for it. We didn't have time to use the pool so can't comment on this. This hotel is definitely not a 4* (as we have stayed in far nicer Travelodges).,natalie78
UR23761117,2009-21-January,Just got back from a fabulous weekend break with my children. WE book two rooms at the Barbican Thistle on arrival we were informed that the rooms were not next to each other as requested they did upgrade our rooms to delux as compensation. The rooms were very nice the bathrooms both had mold on the bathroon ceiling and shower screens. Beds were very comfortable. We had to queue for over half an hour each morning to get into the restaurant for breakfast then another half an hour to get the buffet breakfast we had to do it as a relay as the table kept being given away to other residents by the hotel staff!! It is a good 15 min walk to the nearest tube station.,jcharmers
UR25445751,2009-2-March,just back and though i would try to write a fair review was worried before I went. check in and was offered an upgrade three times was warned before we arrived this would happen and declined. Room was small but clean and we were not going to spend long in the room any way. We got a deal so it was ok but would not pay the full price definalty not. Location of hotel really let it down no where to eat or drink if you wanted to stay local. and would not walk around at night felt unsafe. But having said that day light and transport links good No 4 takes you to st pauls and onward to covernt garden. and we took a lot of taxis. We done the orginal bus tour and I would really recomend this. we also seen dirty dancing which was excellant. Visited camden market excellant experenice overall excellant weekend Next time will try to get a hotel at a better location to save on taxis fares!,lebellScotland
UR42912785,2009-19-September,This hotel is not in a great location as it is not that near any tube stations. It is walkable from the nearest stations but if you have luggage I'd get a cab. The room was OK....I had a single room booked by my company (they try to get you to upgrade when you check in even though my company had pre paid they try to get you to upgrade with your own money. I declined although apprently the upgraded rooms are much better). The sinlge bed was bigger than I expected (a very large single) and much better than other other single beds I've had in London hotels. The room had most things you wanted a hair dryer and iron (although old!) and a good flat screen TV which was good as it saved space. The bathroom was not great though my toilet did not flush properly and it was just outdated and did not seem that clean to me. The room was freezing cold and the heating did not work. After calling reception and waiting over an hour I was brought a heater. We did not eat our evening meal in the hotel choosing to go out for food. Be aware this is not a great area of London to go out in for food although we did find a nice Thai a 10 min walk away. Breakfast the next morning was really really bad. We had to queue (not becuase it was full though they were just really slow). Our table was only have laid which was bad. None of the staff seemed to speak English I asked for vegetarian sausages and after three requests and three different people asked was given a sachet of tomato sauce and a bowl of brown sause (they though I wanted vegetarian sauses!). It emerged there were no vegetarian sausages. I would not usually mind but the fruit selection was dire. The rest of the breakfast was really bad too with staff really ignorant and food just not cooked. In the morning we had a 'shuttle' to the tube station. The shuttle is a people carrier with nice spacious seats (only 4) which is not great when you have queues of people waiting for a lift. The conceirge was rude when asked about it although the porter really friendly. Some people were made to sit on the plastic bits in between seats I refused as this is not only dangerous but probably illegal too. Overall I would not choose to stay here again but if I had to with work I just know to get taxis bring food from a supermarket for tea and skip breakfast!,Sarah6969pink
UR35134563,2009-19-July,The price was good so I took a chance on this place despite the reviews that suggested it was a gamble. They weren't wrong most of what you read here is accurate. My favourite sight in the hotel was a kebab that someone had thrown into the (external) stair well. It had obviously been there some time but clearly none of the hotel staff cared enough to clean it up. That's the general impression of the place - nobody gives a monkeys. Facts: Clean room sufficient towels and toiletries tea and coffee comfortable enough beds. But stuffy & hot thin walls dated and generally uncared for. I've stayed in better places for less in London and won't return here.,smozzinator
UR47135607,2009-18-October,OMG... i never seen such 4 star in my life and more than shure that never stay there... Staeyed at STANDARD SNGL ROOM... No refrigerator and minibar inside TV shows only few useless local channels like Five BBC and etc Discovery and other channels were not available due expired card date no heater inside in October where outside temp is no more than +12 C... Breakfast was awfull and consists only grilled tomato hashbrawns baked beens and grilled bacons... So i do not recommend this hotel for you guys...,Dovik
UR30223721,2009-18-May,Too many rooms for too few staff. In dependance crammed rooms with very small corridors. Heating not functioning well and corner rooms with disturbing hissing windy sounds. Toiletries of not great quality. Long queues for breakfast. Walking distance from tube is ok but at night time a bit of a dodgy area to stroll around. Too many people in general with too many conferences. Observed a room service tray parked in a fire exit for 2 days/nights.,PalomaRossa
UR47085493,2009-17-October,TOP TIP - Dont bother. Shows how misleading 4 stars can be. Booked in by Conference Organizer. Took twenty minutes to check in SIX of us arriving together. Double Room was clean cramped and tired. Shower "dribbled" when I turned the temperature down. Window catches in my room did not work allowing in the noise of (I think) Central Street. Breakfast (described as "homecooked") was desultory. Long queue to find formica table. Pile of bacon in the "buffet" looked disgusting - the smell of bacon (on the 6th floor) mentioned by a previous reviewer might have been when this bacon was cooked. Tomatoes seemed to have been "cooked" or warmed by passing through kitchen area not necessarily touching any hot surface. Fruit salad looked appetising - but disappeared when I looked for this potentially tasty delight.,GreyPound_9
UR24671538,2009-17-February,This trip was easily my worst hotel experience. I booked the weekend package of a standard room to extend a stay in London after visiting friends. The deal was great considering there is a pool (a rarity in London hotels) but as ever with such things there was quite a catch! On arriving I checked in and was asked three times by the receptionist whether I wanted to upgrade at a cost of "20 quid" to which I declined as in decent hotels it's generally not required. I was directed to the building opposite where all the standard rooms are and couldn't believe how dark dingy and cheaply finished the building was. My room was miniscule with cheap ugly furnishings and a dreadful smell of damp. I returned to reception and asked to upgrade and was sent to another room equally small and just with slightly nicer furniture. At this point I contacted the Hilton in Islington who offered a deluxe room for just 4 more and we resolved to leave. I informed the reception who advised me that I would lose what I'd paid for the room because it was after 2pm (by about 15 minutes) and after arguing for ten minutes they offered to upgrade me to a suite. We checked the room which had a piece of wallpaper torn off was decorated in orange yellow red and green with stripey wallpaper (where it remained) and was about the size of a standard room anywhere else (not a particularly sweet suite). Despite not being happy I was still not able to cancel the booking and the cost of my original upgrade was still charged. Add to that the fact that the carpet on the lift walls had been ripped off for someone to tear 'You are gay" into the foam and I was not impressed. The pool is the only draw given that the hotel is in a terrible location (pretty much in the middle of a council estate) there is nowhere close by to eat and the bars of Farringdon are generally closed at the weekend. As a former London resident even I felt uncomfortable with the location. Stay away!!,Rachieroo1
UR42159475,2009-16-September,Got this room on lastminute.com payed 130 for one night thought i'd treat myself instead of checking into the Kings Cross travelodge what a waste of money the hotel was dismal unpleasent staff who's only word to me was to bark 'no breakfast' then i was given the furthest room in the old part peeling wallpaper a bathroom that looked like it was from a 1970's b&b. An experience very far away from their promotional shots. I end up wishing i'd saved 50 and got a room at the Kings Cross Travellodge which i've stayed in before and which is much more honest about what they offer and has nicer bathrooms. The best i can say is adequate maybe they have better rooms but not it seems for anybody arriving with a lastminute.com prepay. Last word: Avoid,tour23
UR47045372,2009-16-October,This hotel has come to be known as the Thistle Ghetto amongst my colleagues and has thankfully been banned from our approved list of hotels. The location in the middle of an East London council estate is downright scary. The only reasonable way to get to and from the hotel is by taxi. I wouldn't walk on the street here in daylight let alone at night. The rooms are tiny the curtains and bedspread belong in a wigwam and there are suspicious stains everywhere. Don't bother ringing the front desk because they won't answer. And make sure to take your satnav if you want to find your room in this maze of a building. Want to get an idea of the service level than take a look at the 'auto-reply' comments which the hotel staff adds to each review on this site. The replies you will get from them in real live are about as helpful and relevant as these. Whatever you do don't stay at this hotel!,MvR-Travels
UR26241961,2009-16-March,I was encouraged when initially entering the foyer as it looked nice and modern there was a bar showing the football which was lovely after a long travel. The pool looked great so walked to my room smiling. I put my key in the door and as it opened was hit with a wall of heat.....ok i thought i'll jus pop the air con on...... but there was none just a standalone fan. Trying to sleep in this heat was terrible especially as the windows only opened a few cm's. The room was dirty with mould on the ceiling and the furniture was broken and tired...... I brought it as one of these secret hotel deals where i thought i was getting a great hotel for a good saving however i would not pay what i did for this hotel for the quality i was given.,poshboyfletch
UR32360925,2009-15-June,The hotel was the least to say terrible. The hotel had chipped walls and was not so clean overall. The streets outside where dark and the area is the worst to stay around. It seemed that the area was so dreadful that a man alone would rather not walk on his own. Very scary  dangerous - like area. Would never even pass outside again.,mlescape
UR41678793,2009-14-September,We booked a 2 night stay as part of a Theatre break 4 star Hotel?-Sorry it does not in my opinion qualify for a 4 star Hotel. I have to say 'Holiday Inn' do it better! We arrived positive went up to our room first reactions: CONS: -Very dated-old wood style units wallpaper peeling and bubbling burn mark on the desk -Bathroom very small (I could not shut the door when sitting down and using the toilet as it hit my knees!) no lock on bathroom door a strange wooden square compartment in the middle of the tiles behind the shower-picture attached. sealant around bath/sink/toilet peeling off. -Room service very slow-no joke 6 attempts is what it took to get hold of someone from reception to help us. -Desk fan frontage flew off when I turned it on-bit of a H&S worry there! -Maids/staff come in to your room rather than wait for you to get back if they need something from it i.e. I had a Iron & Ironing Board brought up and when I got back it had disappeared!? I Put the 'Do not disturb' on door the next morning (as I was told to do so sarcastically by a member of staff when I complained about staff/maids just coming in & out) but the maids came in anyway? It just meant that I couldnt relax in the room as it was made clear to me that it was not my own even though I had paid for it for 2 nights. -My in-laws were put in the block across the way (as the building is in 2 parts) it was my mother-in law's birthday but she had to suffer with an extremely hot room and no cold running water. A fan was brought up but they still had to wedge the door open to let air in-This really needs to be addressed if it is to live up to its 4 star status. -Quite a walk from Old Street if you have luggage in tow. PROS: -Nice breakfasts dinner was tasty- good food service. (Although 3 hairs were found in my families food/drink-not pleasant.) -Flat screen LCD TVs in the rooms. -Tea & Coffee making facilities in rooms. -Beds quite comfy.,needmoreHolidays0
UR34764418,2009-14-July,Am sat in room writing this. Here on business and this was the nearest and most affordable hotel for me. Next time i'll look for something nicer and further away. This hotel has entered my top#5 worst hotels list. On check-in go for the upgrade if you can otherwise you'll end up in the 'tower' and stay in a room which is more like a university hall of residence than a 100/night hotel room. Single bed is tiny furniture is very dated fan doesn't work and window doesn't open much. But the TV is good! The location doesn't seem to be that nice so feeling cowardly I ate in the brasserie. All the solo diners were lined up on tiny tables pretending to be engrossed in a book/newspaper/mobile whilst actually inwardly sobbing. The service was unfriendly and when i asked for a glass of water i was almost scoffed at. The Caeser salad was a strange brown colour and i wasn't convinced with the chicken although they made up for it with a very generous amount of croutons. Thrown in some anemic chips and you'll be given a bill for 17 with the service charge already added for your convenience. I asked for the service charge to be removed and scampered back to my shoe box/room. It's only 2045 and i'm going to sleep to escape the experience. This is the first review i've written i've tried to be balanced and note previous reviewers' comments but really if you do have a choice don't choose this hotel.,Thumbturn
UR37666179,2009-14-August,Stayed for 1 night for an early start business meeting I drove in and found it ok the hotel is just inside the congestion charging zone so expenses down 16 to start with parking outside was easy they have few spaces though and charge 20 per 24hrs. my company uses a booking agent and they had the booking but they said it had not been paid it had when i checked but i had to pay myself on check out. I was offered an upgrade for 25 for air con i took the upgrade and i am glad I did after reading the reviews on this site. The room was ok comfortable large bed flat screen tv tea and coffee. The bathroom was a bit cramped and the shower was not very powerfull considering this is classed as a 4star hotel. incidentaly the signing to the room is terrible I ended up wandering the corridors loaded with luggage and lap top trying to find my room when ieventualy found it it took several attempts for the key to work. I did not eat in the hotel having arranged to meet a collegue for dinner but on leaving the hotel i noticed several coaches of italian tourists arriving they were queing for the lift and rudely did not wait for me to exit before charging in. It was a different story at Breakfast when I came down at 7.45 there was a queue back to the lifts waiting for a table I cancelled my breakfast checked out and ate at a costa on my walk into Barbican. didn't use the leisure facilities so can't comment. overall the hotel is quite convenient for driving and staying if you need to get into City recomend you upgrade though and this makes it pricey.,grgrgray
UR27982334,2009-14-April,We booked this hotel 'blind' as a Top Secret Hotel Deal. After we found out which hotel we had booked and read the reviews we prepared ourselves for the worst. The building is ugly and the facade cracked. It also stands in the middle of some high rise council flat blocks. The room we were given by the hardly english speaking staff was in the annex. The decor was rather dated. The windows didnt appear to be sealed in as it sounded as if we were sat on the pavement next to the road. There was no trace of the minibar or hairdryer that should have been there according to the room description. When we asked the concierge which way to take to walk to the next tube station he directed us to one that was shut due to maintenance. Hmm... The parking for the car overnight was 20 pounds. On the positive side: The beds were comfortable and we had a huge TV in our room (which due to the thin walls I am sure our neighbours enjoyed too). All in all the hotel was definitely not the 4 star spa hotel they are trying to sell but rather a 2 star budget hotel. It served its purpose as we were visiting to sightsee and not to linger about a luxury hotel.,blueypie
UR49139008,2009-13-November,First room was so bad we had to be moved just a few things Stained sheets wallpaper hanging off draws broken window broken dirty toilet stained walls holes in walls no heating apart from small radiator no aircon bath was rotten lamps falling apart etc.. Room was so bad i asked to be moved after refusing to be upgraded and a lot of fuss finaly moved to second room a few probles with that dirty taps bath toilet lights off NO FIRE instructions!!!!!!!! electrical test on hairdryer 6 years over due walls so thin you can hear everything basicaly a terrible hotel is an old office block converted and not very well stay away please,sonic11
UR34660582,2009-13-July,Booked this through lastminue.com and upon arrival were given a room in the tower block across the road that was similar to the 8per night hostel I stayed in in Dublin. Wallpaper coming off small twin camp beds (we'd booked a double) and definately didn't reflect the official star rating this hotel has. Upgraded at cost to a "deluxe double" that was anything but deluxe - comparable to a travelodge but as x4 the cost. Not enough bath towels broken shower air conditioning that sounding like mating elephants dated (gharish) decor where just some of the problems. Staff were pleasent and helpful but struggled to speak clear Engish. The food was acceptable but vastly overpriced as where the drinks,NuttyMariner
UR48981808,2009-11-November,Bedroom in need of decoration. Bathroom is tired. Pillows and towels require replacement. Tubes are too far to walk in inclement weather especially if carrying luggage.,SuzyT10
UR29790284,2009-11-May,Stayed here for work and while we was blown away by the lovely lobby our hopes were soon smashed as we were quickly dismissed to the cruddy side of the hotel. It was almost like being dismissed to the servants quarters of castle. I had a single room in which the walls were so thin i could hear every word (and i mean every word) of conversations in both the room next to me and above me! Shower was weak in-room hairdryer was weaker. It was only the next morning we noticed the obvious and unattended damp damage above the windows in the hall ways. Breakfast the next morning was greasy so i stuck with continental. The staff were friendly and rumor has it that the rooms above the spectacular lobby were much better. Lucky this hotel is in London where you can spend most of your time out of the hotel. Left this hotel thankful i wasn't footing the bill!,gduffy10
UR37383717,2009-11-August,_ stayed for two nights. put in awful single rooms costing nearly 200 per night. grotty no air con (mid summer boliing hot!). lift broke so had to walk down stairs which would have been ok but they are also grotty. had waiter knock on door at 7 am for room serivce when hadnt ordered it and did not even apoligse for waking up. breakfast very basic. firend had a wake up call on both days she did not order and woke here up at 6 am both days. keys wuldnt work when we arrived abck late at night and had to get amintace up to sort it out. a big walk form tube. after having travled around the world i stayed in better hotels in the 3rd world! the main problem is you would put up with the hotel if it was cheap- however it is not and it was a big waste of money .,YorkLkjhg
UR48883959,2009-10-November,I thought this hotel was awful - especially considering the price. The room was damp cold and dark. The remote on the tv didn't work and I couldn't get through to anyone in reception to ask a question.,TylerD81
UR50998562,2009-10-December,I was horrified at the state of this supposedly 4* hotel but never more so than finding that the bed in my room had been "soiled" and left for the next guest. The smell! On telephoning reception to have the room changed I received no apology and was told to pack up and come to reception. I was given a "superior" room with damp stains on the walls broken curtain rail a shower that barely held together a kettle that did not work etc. etc. Never never again.

UR27759129,2009-10-April,I booked this through Last Minute as a top secret hotel. I use this a lot and have never been disappointed until now. I had requested a double room but was told they had run out (even though I checked in shortly after 3pm when check in opened) BUT that I could upgrade to a double for an extra 15 per night. This was clearly a hotel bent on making money. I was given a twin room on the 6th floor. The hotel feels dated and badly in need of refurbishment. The carpets are tired and the decor needs redoing. My room was an odd shape with sloping walls by the windows. It was basic - no air con or mini bar - and very shabby. I would have thought this ok for a 2 star - or even a 3 at a push - but not the standards you expect from a 4 star hotel. The corridor door outside the room squeaked loudly each time it was opened. There was basic tea and coffee facilities (although I had to put the kettle on the floor to plug it in) but no herbal tea hot chocolate or biscuits. The location is awful - it is 10 - 15 minute walk to any tube and the hotel is hidden down back streets. If it is going to survive the hotel has to work a lot harder at making the experience enjoyable especially given its location. I would advise you to book elsewhere.,mrsnesbett
UR45564677,2009-1-October,I had the misfortune of staying at the Thistle Barbican as I was working in London for 3 days late September. I'm used to staying in hotels of a lower standard than I would usually choose when travelling for pleasure when I go away on business so I always have quite low expectations...and boy did Thistle Barbican manage to drag my expectations down to murky levels. Firstly the area isn't great which if you're there on business isn't such a problem but for tourists it is in the wrong area and a good 15 minutes through a rough part of town to the tube. My allocated room was small by any standards badly in need of redecoration. The walls are paper thin so if you have anyone in the room next to you be prepared to hear every word they say or listen to their choice of TV channel. I think I got 3 hours sleep a night between the noise next door and the slamming doors. The service was very poor I phoned reception to ask for an iron at 6pm on day 1 and it hadn't materialised by the time I checked out despite numerous further requests. I was woken at 11.30pm on night 2 by 2 strange men banging on my door and trying to handle - which by the way wasn't very sturdy and I didn't feel very safe as a solo female traveller. I phoned reception who after 15 minutes sent a 'security guard' who advised me to put the latch on the door...there wasn't one. Other annoyances include the queue for breakfast (I saw people who were queuing for over 15 minutes to get a seat). They ran out of milk glasses and juice and a pot of tea I ordered never arrived. The only positive thing I can say is the concierege guys were very friendly and efficient. All in all no matter the deal or desperation I would NEVER stay here again.,superwrong
UR23154934,2009-1-January,This hotel is billed as a four star most three star establishments we have stayed in have been better. The room was terribly small almost claustrophobic with very little room to move around. Indeed when I used the desk the only way my wife could cross the room was by climbing over the bed. There was no soundproofing. Our stay was on New Years Eve and those in the room next door returned to their room at 03:15 with friends. Let's just say the walls were so thin we knew every detail of the emotional turmoil one of the women was going through. Although afvertised as being Thistle City Barbican it is away from the Barbican Centre in a more run down area. Indeed it was so lively that in the middle of the emotional events next door we were distracted by a mass brawl in the street (this was at 03:50). Due to the number of guests we had to take breakfast in the overspill area. Breakfast was a buffet but there was no toast available. In summary our experience with Thistle Hotels have been good up to now but this one was a great disappointment.,BritishTraveller123
UR16768520,2008-8-June,Got a good room for the price but terrible treatment from the persons who work there. Got at the hotel around 2am was really tired and got really bad treated as there was a problem with my reservation my english isnt the better and they didnt made a slight effort to make themselves understandable maybe cause i wasnt wearing a suit...? In the morning saw people wearing suits being really well treated but the same for me kept going while i was trying to check out. Had to go figure where my room was as i got no indications. Despite that the room is high quailty service and very quiet. If you are wearing a suit when staying there than service should be top quality. Despite that enjoyed the staying as the room was real private and very quiet.,Hildor
UR17639470,2008-8-July,Absolutely dire for the star rating! I've stayed in much nicer travel lodges. How does London get away with having such poor 4 star hotels?? The area was tower-block central The room was so tiny the tv had been taken off the stand on the wall as you would not have been able to walk past the bed if it were there. Light fittings were hanging off the wall the shower sprayed in all directions the bedding was stained and everything looked old! I must admit I didn't try the pool or sauna and the concierge was very helpful with taxis however. Just make sure you know what to expect (I was so excited about going to a 4 star london hotel!) and don't go unless you get a mega good deal on the room. Good luck!,persephone1978
UR15765085,2008-7-May,The hotel is situated a short walk from Shoreditch. It is nowhere near a bus or tube connection. I would advise getting back to the hotel before dark as the local tower blocks look a haven for muggers. It was probably a nice hotel when in was last decorated back in the seventies! The food selection is dreadful - first hotel I have encountered that didnt have Beef Chicken or Pork on the menu. The bathroom is cramped with broken tap fittings and a cracked toilet basin - its 2 star minimalist at best. The bedroom is tiny in need of new furniture. There is no air conditioning but the window does open 2 inches. The TV is an ancient 12 or 14" CRT kids bedroom model. Two of the main UK chans ITV and Chan4 do not work. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone,davebav50
UR18681420,2008-6-August,A large group of us stayed at this hotel last weekend for a hen weekend. Admittedly we were a large group averaging 20 throughout the two nights we stayed however the hotel was not in the least bit organised despite one of our party having contacted them well in advance to advise them and confirm with them the itinerary for the day on Saturday. As part of a hen package organised by a booking agent we had each paid for a mini spa treatment lasting half an hour. The week before we were told that the treatments could not take place in the spa itself but instead we would have to use two of the rooms we had booked. The treatments had not been scheduled properly and the one bit of paper that they were scribbled down on was lost. It was then left to two of our party to talk to each individual and re-schedule the treatments. There was lots of confusion and some girls ended up having their treatments moved several times. Furthermore not everyone was asked if they suffered from any illnesses or allergies nor was everyone asked to sign disclaimer forms. For those of us hoping to enjoy the spa facilities the jacuzzi was "closed for maintenance" despite no-one maintaining it at all throughout the day. As I said above we were a large party however the staff at the spa did not once apologise and were unconcerned and at times downright rude. One girl went down to use the hairdryer in the spa on the Saturday evening as the hairdryers in the rooms were not particularly powerful and was challenged by a member of the spa staff and accused of not staying at the hotel. When she told him she was staying there and questioned his rudeness he countered that "it was as much her fault as his" for not telling him she was staying there and started to shout at her. At breakfast on the Sunday morning there were clearly not enough staff on duty and despite having reserved a table for our party it was not fully set for enough people. When I asked a girl who was clearing tables if she could bring 3 settings to our table she replied "no you're sitting in the bar and I'm not working in the bar" and walked off. All of the above said when we did complain to the manager she was very apologetic and offered us free sandwiches for lunch. The rooms were comfortable enough and generally the hotel is OK. However if you have paid a lot of money (which we had) and the hotel has been advised in plenty of time of the number of guests etc. then they should have been fully prepared. And even if things go wrong which we expect from time to time there is no excuse for rudeness and bad manners. I would not stay here again and I doubt any of the girls in my party would either not least the hen who was reduced to tears during the spa debacle.,Avo76
UR21565314,2008-5-November,Stayed one night mid-week on a business trip and paid 190 for a shabby basic room in a tatty hotel. The non-smoking room stank of stale cigarette smoke and was so cramped it was difficult to find space to turn. It would have been poor value if it had cost half the price.,s2art50
UR15661022,2008-5-May,I booked a single room at a "4 star" hotel so I was expecting a slightly smaller room than normal but with good decour and a "4 star" feel. What I got was a tiny dingy room that reminded me of a Blackpool B&B - how my heart sank when I saw it - who every graded this as a 4* hotel must have never seen building two where these grotty / small rooms are! Their was no air conditioning just a window which you could not fully open and a stand alone floor fan which circulated the hot air. The bathroom was tiny and did not even have a full sized bath so I could not have a bath - the shower head was also rusty so could not direct the spray. (I even kicked the toilet while getting out of the shower - twice!) Their was stains on the ceiling and the bed was tiny. Also the sink overflow did not work in the bathroom. Tea and Coffee facilitys! The kettle looked like the cheap / tacky travel version!. To sum up not 4* in standard rooms - maybe a 1* - info on online travel company misleading i.e pic's / discription.,Sprit_05
UR15638057,2008-4-May,stayed at this hotel last night as we went to watch a showhow anybody can say this hotel is nice is beyond me !!!!!!!!! area that its in is scarywe are a married couple in our 30s so we are not an old couple i mean the area itself is ruff with all high rise council flats surrounding the hotelwe did get a taxi into the west end which cost us 40 but anything was better than staying in this grotty dumpthe room was dark and dingythe wallpaper was hanging offthere was hair and grime on the taps and they had stuck the curtains to the wall with blue tac.Our headboard had stains on it and i have done nothing but itch since i slept on the bed (which by the way was rock solid and past it ).Dont get me wrong the reception area is beautifull and plush carpets through to the corridors but then i am afraid thats where it all stops.We stay in london a lot as we have family there but never have i ever stayed in a grot hole like this the B+B s are much better than this so called hotel and i am amazed it has a rating at all.We came down for breakfast in the morning and we ended up just having tea and toast as i think they need lessons in cooking as the breakfast consisted of undercooked eggs(and i mean they were undercooked)and everything else was coldnormally when we stay in london the rooms are clean and tidy and the breakfast is hot but this hotel is unreal.I would never stay here ever again as its a dump.And beware the pictures you see on their profile is not what you get .,sarah_121
UR22272738,2008-28-November,The "Barbican" location in the title is around a 10 minute walk away but a good shuttle bus will drop you off at the nearest tubes. Although the public areas of the hotel are well decorated my room on the second floor was tired. The bathroom had seen better days and there appeared to be something growing in the (empty) mini bar fridge! The bed was comfortable & the room was warm which was OK for my one night stay but I wouldn't have wanted to spend any time there,welshtravel
UR13072191,2008-28-January,Stayed in the Thistle for one night on business. On walking to the hotel from the tube I thought I was walking into an unsavoury area on account of the surrounding buildings and state of repair. The staff were really good on arrival and really helpful. The hotel itself is in need of a revamp and feels a little tired. My room as with a lot of the hotels in London was cramped and only just fitted a bed. At 120/night for bed only you get better value in a travel lodge the breakfast was 17 on top of that!! All rooms were supposed to be non smoking but my room smelt and felt like the "smoking hut" on an industrial park and I think the furnishings had not been cleaned for ages. The room was noisy and you could hear the "goings on" in other rooms I was woken in the middle of the night by somebody flushing a toilet thought I had a leak!!!! In the morning I was privileged to a cold shower unfortunately I had not had the pleasure of a good night on the wine the night before so it was not appreciated!! On mentioning to the desk on check out that there was no hot water the good gentlemen gave me a discount like I said the staff were helpful. I am sorry to say this was not one of the best nights I have had and it makes you embarrassed to be from the UK when you compare our London hotels with most abroad. As with most things here we seem to get short changed and as a consequence I would not stay here again through choice,handyspanner
UR19455889,2008-28-August,the room was horrible and not clean. The bathroom smelled of vomit and you aren't guaranteed a hot shower every day. If you are going to be out in the city all day and only need a place to sleep its okay and the price is very reasonable for London. Islington is only a 10 minute walk and it has a nice highstreet. I'll try another hotel next time.,jj6870
UR20416054,2008-27-September,this hotel is advertised as a 4 star establishment but the reality is far from that! the room was ok but had a smell of stale smoke even though we had requested a no smoking room. the gym was very good pleasant and helpful staff. but the breakfast was a joke....... lukewarm weak tea coffee not much better no cutlery on table and we asked for toast on 2 mornings and we are still waiting for it........... i have stayed in a good few european hotels and this is the worst breakfast service i ever experienced!,reubenireland
UR18284049,2008-26-July,I stayed in this hotel while on business in London. The hotel was not my first choice however I was allocated to stay here due to other hotels in the area being full. I arrived at the hotel well after midnight and upon checking in the receptionist told me that he'd upgraded my room. I was most pleased and when told my room was on the 6th floor I took this to be a good sign. Unfortunately when I got out the lift I was appalled at the state of the corridor the decor was that of a mid '70s council office. However it was late and I was tired so I made my way to my room the door opened to what was a small stuffy twin room that was extremely basic and barrenly furnished. I dreaded to think what the room was like that I'd been upgraded from. There was no air conditioning in the room (how any so-called 4 star London hotel can not have air conditioning is beyond me). Had it not been so late I would have immediatly requested to be moved. To compensate I ordered some room service - a simple sandwich - 10 minutes after placing my order I got a call to tell me that they had run out of the ingredients for what I had requested so I changed my order to a salmon sandwich. About 20 minutes later a plate was brought to my door on which sat a sandwich that you would be embarrassed to give a dog artfully dressed with some crisps that looked like they'd seen better days. The following day after a fitful night's sleep I walked from the 6th floor to reception and it did appear that some of the other floors looked a bit better decorated so maybe I had drawn the short straw. However you would think that the hotel would accommodate a solo businesswomen traveller in a comfortable room where one didn't have to double lock the door in order to feel safe. Please don't stay here unless you are on a super-tight budget and don't mind sleeping in an oven.,MintTea
UR21195182,2008-25-October,we booked to stay 3 nights and we had 6 adults in our group.We stayed here to be fair becasue the price was good and the pistures on the web sites all looked very nice. We arrived to find the reception area was bright and modern the breakfast/dinner area also clean and bright. the hotel was split into 2 buildings ask to stay in the main building as the rooms are of a highter standard (IT was what i expected to start with) the rooms in the other block are with the blue/green decoration which are out of date.the rooms verid in size but all are clean.The let down is when you look closer the walls and floors have dirty marks or stains on them.The walls and tiles have holes in from pass drilling and our radiator had 2 big rust marks on !!. the lay- out of the tv pussed in the corner the dressing area all reminded me of the 70's. We had a very noisey 1st night so asked if they could move us to a quiet room.Which they did and it was in the main block.This was what i had expected to find when i arrived it is clean no holes in the walls or tiles quiet modern the whole room was great ! how ever i would not pay to upgrade yourself into this room i would stay else where.,truthtraveladvisor
UR20345675,2008-24-September,We had a very disappointing night in this hotel. The room was shabby though we were asked on arrival if we wished to buy an upgrade. Big mistake that we didn't as the room was definitely shabby and well below 4* standards. The shower head looked like an incubation zone for Legionaires Disease. Poor quality hand towels and curtains that had been remade. Enough said!,mebates00
UR19310345,2008-24-August,After reading the previous bad reviews on this hotel i was very worried about staying here but the photos of the rooms looked very good and as this was a 4 star hotel was confident that the hotel would be ok. I had booked 1 night in a double room but due to some confusion with the travel company i had been booked into a twin room. The room was the smallest room i had ever seen with no air conditioning & was very noisy due to the large number of groups staying at the hotel. Not the sort of room you would want to stay in with your husband on a weekend break. I asked to be moved to another room and offered to pay for an upgrade but the hotel was fully booked so we had no choice but to check out & go home as we would not have got any sleep sleeping in an oven and listening to the groups of people coming back to their rooms. We did complain to the manager who was not really interested as the problem with the room type is with the travel company which we have taken up with them. However we were advised there were no other rooms but after checking out we were telephoned to advise a double room was now available so we could come to the hotel. After hearing other people complaining about their rooms we decided not to come back as did not want to be disappointed again.,Olivia035
UR20296545,2008-23-September,Booked this through late rooms. For my previous visit I had stayed in the Thistle Kensigton which was fine but not available this time. This hotel was a fair distance from the Barbican - much further than is implied on the web site & quite a way from any tube station. On arrival it was more like a timeshare sales pitch - trying to sell me an upgrade discount if I paid for breakfast now.....Once through that the twin room I got was small & very dated - pbviously in need of some refurb. The only saving grace was the gym which was great & allowed me to think I was running away from the place - unfortunately it was on the treadmill so I didn't get anywhere. My one effort to call reception took 15 minutes and three calls before the phoine was answered.,Huga
UR22118085,2008-23-November,This is the worst hotel in London its dirty damp has no heating and the staff are very rude. i won't give it 2 stars let alone its 4 star claim. I rang to comfirm my late check-in to a pre paid double roombut when i arrived i got a twin room . I was informed i could pay an additional fee to get an up grade to a double room even though i had booked a double. When i got to the twin room there was no heating in the room. It was freezing. The walls and ceils had large damp patches and the sheets on the beds were damp like the room had not been heated in a few days. the wallpaper was coming off the walls in parts of the room and the bathroom was dirty . When i rang reception to complain about this they told me to turn on the radiator on the wall and that the room would "heat up". The receptionist was rude and seemed to think it weird that i was complaining about no heat on in the room before i got there. It was November and freezing outside- i think heat is a basic! no? After two more phone calls to reception and very unhelpful rude staff i asked to speak to the manger. I eventually was moved rooms to another twin room. This was not as bad as the last room  it was at least warm. but it still had some damp patches on the walls and the curtains had big rips in them. I stayed 3 days and ate room service once a steak sandwich and chips. the food was discusting!! the steak looked like it had been taken off a half finished meal and cut into pieces before it was covering in mustard and put between two tiny pieces of bread the chips had been in the fryer for longer than a few hours- crispy is an understatement! I would never stay here again!!! I go to london about 4-6 times a year and this is the worst hotel i have ever stayed in.,DublinNK
UR16331108,2008-23-May,Booked in to this hotel at relatively short notice (early morning for that night) as was working late in london. Probably one of the most appalling hotels I have ever stayed in. Grubby outdated and like a 1970's student bedsit...only worse!,cambridgeboy
UR22971547,2008-23-December,Rooms not booked through the hotel itself (i.e. lastminute.com) seem to all be put up in the older block which were definetly 2 star quality. Transport is only average. a free shuttle runs on weekdays only. Leisure centre was nice but not impressed overall.,cp_rua
UR14437101,2008-21-March,I stayed here for 3 nights earlier this week on business. I was allocated a single room which was a small cramped single-bed room. The room was gloomy facing inwards into a courtyard which housed the noisy aircon units. The bathroom was poorly lit with two small recessed lights in the ceiling. The ceiling tiles had brown water stains (from the floor above) in 3 different places. The pull switch that changed the water flow from bath to shower had the top missing. The shower head was covered in limescale. The cramped bathroom meant there was very little space to climb into the side of the bath because of the proximity of the toilet; the only other option was to climb in at the sloping end of the bath. Anyone not fully mobile would have struggled. The toilet did not always flush away fully so it had to be checked shortly afterwards and flushed again.The lift arrival 'ping' which was 4 rooms away could easily be heard all the time. The paintwork was tired and chipped throughout the hotel. Breakfast was buffet-style with a 5 minute wait to be seated. A waiter/waitress eventually asked whether you wanted tea or coffee and toast. The tea was weak and it took until the last morning for the toast to arrive before I had to leave the table - even then it was cold. Check-in/check-out was slick and efficient. The gym/pool area was the hotel's only redeeming feature. The hotel is located in an unsalubrious poorly lit area and as I was on my own I didn't fancy walking in the area at night. Definitely not worthy of 4 stars - it needs a lot of work!,specsaver
UR12847544,2008-21-January,The staff were really friendly but the room was horrendous. It looked as though it hadn't changed for the last 30 years. It was very cramped the bed probably hadn't changed either judging by how uncomfortable it was. It was also very noisy. I ordered an ironing board in the morning that was burnt! Staff were good and breakfast ok but really not worth the room. Will never stay again!,SparklesGuildford
UR15194334,2008-21-April,I was very disappointed at the quality of this hotel given how much it cost us (even at a reduced rate through laterooms.com). Although the reception gave the impression of a four star modern hotel the rooms were more like 1 or 2 star. The rooms were very small and dingy with horrible stains on the walls. Bathroom was tiny and didn't look particularly clean. I'm sure you can find a lot better hotels for the same money and in a more convenient location. This hotel is quite isolated so wouldn't recommend if you are looking to go out in central London.,Ames_6
UR15159283,2008-20-April,Unhelpful staff at check-in set the scene for a cramped dirty and joyless room with a view of noisy air-conditioners. The kettle didn't work there was no milk the shower was broken there were patches of damp on the ceiling and mould in the bathroom and in the morning I found I'd been attacked by bedbugs. It is far far further than you'd expect to the Barbican and the promised 'shuttle bus' is a people carrier that cannot cater for the number of guests needing to make this journey. Add to this the fact that the hotel is in a rundown area with no nearby restaurants (just a surfeit of takeaways) and you really have to question the star rating. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone and I think the 140 price tag is scandalous central London or not.,pinkjo
UR20557884,2008-2-October,My friend I booked this hotel as we were planning on having a girls weekend in London. To start with the shuttle bus that was supposed to run between the hotel and Kings Cross did not exist! Second point: There is no way in heel that this is a 4 star hotel. The rooms were small dated and dirty. Third point: Breakfast is a joke! Rude waiting staff cold food and dont even bother asking for tea coffee toast or cutlery as you will only be ignored anyway. Last but not least: On the second night I was woken up by a strange rustling sound at 3 am. When i put the light on I found a huge rat sitting on my dressing table!!! (My room was on the 6th floor) After calling the night manager to come to the room i was told there was not much could be done as the rat could no longer be seen. PLEASE DO NOT STAY HERE - EVER,fraggle1982
UR12259002,2008-2-January,A pretty un-remarkable hotel in a non-discript part of London. It's not too far away from old street tube station to be fair (about 5/10 min walk) but there's not much to do round there so its a pretty good job! I stayed here for a week on business in November. The room was functional and quite reasonable in size for London. The bathroom & shower worked fine although they obviously hadn't been updated for quite a while. As other people have mentioned the corridors stank of cooking smells most of the time and I had a fire door next to my room that sounded like a bomb going off everytime it slammed shut! The staff were very variable one was really helpful when my keycard stopped working another one was hopeless when they messed up my bill when I checked out by charged the wrong credit card. Trying to get them rectify this was a nightmare as it can only be done by the accounts department who can't be dailled direct and never seem to be available. Once they had my money customer care pretty much went out the window on that score. I was definately put off staying here again after the hassles I had.,FCUnitedOfManchester
UR13210153,2008-2-February,Beware booking via website on cheap deal you will be offered scummy terrinle room and then have to pay 20 for an 'upgrade' for something just above health hazard. Truly awful rooms. Location terrible. Foyer about same as motorway service station. Nice gym and spa though they don't have any water taps so you have to buy small bottles for 1 each which is cheap and nasty. Not good.,Camberleybob
UR22369433,2008-2-December,This is never a 4* hotel... how the ETB give that rating is beyond me. The bedrooms are absolutely tiny with barely enough room to get into bed from the side. Bathrooms also very small and quite shabby. The decor is peeling and dirty and all in all the hotel should regarded as 2* until it get's an urgently needed refurb. Onthe plus side the bed was very comfortable and the staff friendly,Alfresco69
UR18040599,2008-19-July,If you want a room for the night and a quik dip in the pool then it is acceptable but if you want more London on your doorstep this is a bit out of the way on the edge of the financial district. Rooms very dated no aircon and bathroom could do with a spring clean. Reception very frendly. There is better and cheaper. For a brand name hotel one would expect more.,madfrank
UR21975055,2008-18-November,Although it is convenient for those arriving at STN airport and taking the Liverpool Express the hotel itself is a good 10minute walk from the underground. Whats worse is there are not too many restaurants around or much activity in the vicinity. So we always had to have dinner and then return to the hotel. We had to keep reminding the hotel that we were two of us staying in the room and needed two sets of towels. They would leave just 01 set! The same with the instant coffee packets in the room. There were new staff at the reception every time we walked in. Strange! One of the Lifts was under repair during our entire stay of 5nights. Breakfast was nothing to write home about.... For a first class hotel the Thistle Barbican can do better.,scrutineyes
UR12762624,2008-18-January,Having booked this hotel based upon the website I was somewhat disappointed. The hotel cannot be faulted upon its cleanliness the rooms are standard hotel fare for a London hotel although one has to say that the bathroom was appallingly small and trying to fit even my 5' 6" medium frame into a 4' long bath proved an interesting experience. Do not expect to enjoy a long soak at the end of a hard day. The leisure facilities appeared small but adequate however I was suprised to note that there is a 5 charge for using the pool. Given that this is pretty much the highlight of the hotel website and no doubt attracts customers to this establishment I find it appalling that the cost of this honeytrap is not advertised. Do not eat in the hotel Bar. The food is overpriced and appalling. 12.50 for a small burger and chips is somewhat overpriced and I could only smile with wry amusement at the 12.5 percent obligatory service charge just under a space for an optional gratuity. Having tasted the food I felt that I should be on the receiving end of the gratuity! The area is far from salubrious. I would recommend leaving the hotel at night only if you are a fit individual and wearing a decent set of running kit from my observation of the area a fleet getaway may be needed. All the shops have pull down metal shutters which speaks volumes for the area. Breakfast was pretty appalling in particular given the 17.50 charge (don't ask for breakfast or any meal in your room as they put a 5.00 tray charge on your bill on top of the 12.5% service charge - in essence you would end up paying 25.00 per person for 2 sausages a piece of bacon and a few sundries!!!) the orange juice was cordial based and from the expression on the waitresses face when I asked her to get me a coffee you would assume that I had requested that she clean out the local latrines I returned to my room much chagrined at having asked her to carry out basic waitressing functions :-) This was a passable hotel which did not warrant its 4* status. There are far better hotels at a similar price in better areas of town if you need somewhere to stay. My hotel experience was nothing better than adequate. If you are after a souless overpriced hotel in a seedy part of town opt for this otherwise head for the Tottenham Court Area where there are a plethora of hotels far closer to the delights that London has to offer,BLT2005UK
UR22824382,2008-18-December,I booked a room at this property through the Lastminute.com 'Top Secret Hotels' offer. Having now experienced it at first hand I now understand why they struggle to fill their rooms at a typical central London room rate. Parts of the hotel are very tired and dated but what frustrated me more was the lack of communication between staff. Having specified via Lastminute.com that there would be 2 people sharing the room I checked in at an earlier time than my partner and specifically told them to expect her to check-in later (while I would have been out). "Oh yes not a problem Sir" said the staff member on the front desk but I suspected at the time that she was not listening and too busy trying to persuade me to have dinner in the hotel and to upgrade to a superior room. This turned out to be correct as when my partner arrived they claimed to have no knowledge that she was staying in the room. What a shambles! I can't quite go as far as to say the experience was 'terrible' but I certainly wouldn't recommend it.,MC1978
UR19094627,2008-18-August,Could not believe the size of my room after checking in - if I stretched out both my arms I could nearly touch both walls! See attached picture to get an idea of how small we're talking here note the tiny single bed. No air-conditioning (even though the room guide referred to one) and the room was like a sauna at night (mid-August) even with the window open. There was a compressor outside that was really loud very early in the morning so leaving the window open was a disaster. 3 nights into my stay I have yet to get a full nights sleep. I would not pay 20/night for this place let alone the 120/night my company were swindled out of. On the plus side staff were polite and the gym was adequate. Overall avoid if you can.,jfeeney
UR20150890,2008-17-September,Really bad business hotel. Boiling small rooms and a terrible service. I ordered breakfast in the room and had to cancel it after 45 (!!) minutes as it still hadn't arrived! Really a bad value for money.,Moramare
UR17919554,2008-15-July,Unfortunately all of the previous negative reviews are accurate! The hotel rooms are definitely NOT 4 star! I have stayed in numerous London hotels over the past 5 years and this is the worst of the bunch. rooms are small tired & grotty. No AC in my room reception says that AC is only available in exec rooms and this is on their website. It isn't. First time in years that I have actually double locked a hotel room door. As a female staying alone the location is isolated and the rooms in this building feel less than secure. No mini bar or iron in the room. Room service food was poor but palatable but the grapes with the cheese were mouldy. Staff are OK and pleasant enough. Value for money is poor - there are better B&B's and 2/ star accommodation in London 4 stars must be due to the availability of the facilities here and definitely NOT the rooms!! I would not stay here again or reccommend it to others - spend your money elsewhere - even holiday inn express and travelodge offer better standard basic accommodation than here.,EDItraveller
UR15046524,2008-15-April,On first impressions the Thistle is wonderful. The check in reception is big roomy wonderfully clean and the staff really helpful. The constrast is distinct once you open your bedroom door. The rooms are small very dated paper peeling paint peeling and been painted over without sanding down. . . . are you getting the picture. The Thistle is fantastic at comitting the worst crime known to hotels . . . . . paper thin walls!!!!. We're not talking 80gsm paper here we're talking rice paper. Although a hotel cannot be blamed for the behaviour of guests two girls were having an arguement in the room next to me at 2am I called the concierge who came up promptly but then within 5 minutes (the arguing continued although not at the same volume) room service arrived with lots of "Good evening madam" 's and lots of "yes that will be 18.60" "yes I have change" "enjoy your food" etc. etc. etc. Not blaming the hotel for that just the rice paper walls. I didn't choose to have breakfast in the hotel as I was at a local trade show and in a rush after not having much sleep - I'm sure it would have been fine because the restaurant is created in the same atmosphere as the lobby. My words to my partner were "thank god we didn't chose this 4 star central London hotel as a romantic break" I would have been in tears!!!!!,ziggyNottingham
UR14245230,2008-12-March,I stayed at this hotel because it was specified as the top choice for a conference I was attending in London. At half the price this hotel would still be a complete ripoff. I've stayed at much better places right next to airports; for a hotel in the middle of a city this one is by far the worst I've seen. My room was shabby and badly maintained with with chips taken out of the wall and paint a dusty carpet that looks like it's from 1950 and a complete lack of abiance or charm. In addition many of the rooms features simply didn't work: nonfunctional iron in-room safe that wouldn't open ceiling fan that made a high-pitched squeaking noise fairly expensive internet service that kept dropping the connection and an air conditioner that I ran the entire time which never lowered the temperature. The staff was rude and unapologetic refusing to help with the situation. If you do stay here -- and only do so if you must -- try to get one of the rooms on the lower floors. When the elevators open on the first second or third floors everything looks much much nicer than on the floor I stayed on (5th) -- marble and wood floors rather than the carpet on my floor and a brighter and newer look. Perhaps the hotel was partially redone at some point? Alas I will never find out; I wouldn't pay any sum of money to stay here again. Zero stars if I could.,biztravv
UR22665803,2008-12-December,The hotel is very grotty in the room cleanliness is ok however the room was really run down. The beds was hard and uncomfortable and the bathroom though needs a refurbishment. For what we paid I was very dissapointed and will not stay their again. Both our key cards did not work when we came back to the room that night and had to go to reception to get them changed which was in another building. The area is very dodgey and not a nice part of London I did not feel safe walking around at all. MY MESSAGE TO YOU IS DO NOT STAY HERE.,Wendels65
UR22648890,2008-11-December,The location is not great. A good long walk from the Barbican which makes the name very misleading. The area is residential but quite poor residential although Islington is 15 minutes walk away with lots of antique shops and markets and Starbucks. It was bitterly cold during our stay and the front door of the hotel badly needs attention or a porch to stop an appalling draught that blows throughout the public areas including the bar and restaurant. Lots of people complain about it. The reception people are very pushy about you upgrading and even if you say no thanks they continue to upgrade you at quite some expense deducting it from our card. We asked for this to be reimbursed. During our 5 nights no one refilled the coffee and teas I had to ask which I thought was rather mean of them. I dont know if there is a tube nearby I didnt see one so we walked or used taxis. It is hugely popular for business it seems but is not really for the tourist. The hotel restaurant is expensive a la carte. Nearby there is Jamie Olivers 15 (must be booked) a fabulous fish and chip restaurant - Fishwork and we went one night to a nice Italian family restaurant - Ravello. Islington is a great place to go for shopping and there are some unusual shops including a fantastic wholesale decorative items shop where you can buy lovely things at half price or less. If you have to stay here check out very carefully internet prices. I booked an extra night - the hotel wanted 120 quid for a basic room I booked through Last minute for 72 pounds and then they even gave a free upgrade. The cheap rooms are not very nice really small and old fashioned. The double deluxe are miles better and in the main part of the hotel. Unless you really need to stay in this part of town I think there are better hotels less draughty at least,sallywSallyw
UR19967379,2008-10-September,Me and this hotel got off on the wrong foot from the start. It calls itself Thistle Barbican which to me would suggest that is within the shadow of the Barbican complex on the edge of the city... In truth you can barely see the Barbican towers from the place and as for the claim that 'St Pauls is 10 minutes away...'???? By phone perhaps... Anyway once I'd finally arrived back in 1989 the real nightmare began. I'll concede that check in was smooth and within minutes I was walking to my room (rack rate 199 + VAT.) On arriving in the room I assumed there had been some mix up and I'd actually used my keycard to access a wardrobe...but no it was indeed a room with two single beds to prove the point...sadly the point being I'd booked a double. On attempting to change my room a reasonable request I was told the hotel was full and this was it...I'd checked in after 9pm you see...silly me. On realising that this was to be my cell for the night I decided to make the best of it. As I didn't have a demolition squad available making the best of it really only involved getting some sleep...but it would seem that this most hateful of establishments couldn't even allow me that small concession. Aircon obviously wasn't invented when this hotel was decorated instead a nasty ceiling fan is offered to not only make no discernable difference to ambient air temperature but also whirr so loudly to make it all but useless....if you don't count reminding you just how bad the 1980's were. The bathroom looked like it had escaped from the set of Rising Damp and the shower curtain resembled the Turin Shroud so at least the experience was consistent... After a sleepless night that ended at 6am when the nextdoor room turned their TV on...yes the walls are that thin....I was glad to shower and beat a hasty retreat. I really couldn't recommend it any less...in fact if you're offerred a cardboard box under a flyover as an alternative take it...,Wolfsbait
UR22607685,2008-10-December,Upon arrival the hotel seemed nice enough but receptions staff were awful. The room was very small and very basic (not a 4*) the shower barely worked and when it did the water was freezing cold We were woken up at 9am on a Sunday morning by the maid trying to get it the room despite having a 'do not disturb' sign on the door. We ordered food via room service and only half of the order turned up...but still charged for it. We also booked breakfast to the room on the Sunday morning when it was over 45 mins late we called the room service number to be told it was 'on its way'......1 hour later still no sign. upon checking out we reported the poor level of room service. The receptionist was very rude and informed us that we were not entitled to a refund as the breakfast was included in the price....even though we didnt actually get any breakfast. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone!,1433
UR14928458,2008-10-April,This hotel is a dump. I can only think it gets 4 stars because it has a rare thing for London hotels - a swimming pool. The rooms were small and very tired looking. But the biggest problem for me is that the hotel is actually half a mile from the Barbican in the middle of a very dodgy looking estate. We walked out the first night and did't like the look of the neighbourhood so we ended up spending quite a bit on taxis. The official rate for a hotel of this standard is totally out of proportion to the quality. On and don't stay here on a Sunday night and expect to find anything open. The whole of the Barbican/City/Smithfields area doesn't do Sundays.,DukeOfCumberland
UR21452142,2008-1-November,I stayed in this hotel for two nights for a training course in nearby Clerkenwell. My overall feeling of the hotel was one of disappointment which started when I checked in and lasted right until I left. Despite its name I wouldn't say this hotel is convenient for the City. It's about a mile north of Bank in a very residential area. The hotel is also about a 10-minute walk from Angel Old Street and Barbican Tube stations - not good if you have much luggage. The hotel consists of two buildings; the main reception bars and restaurant are together in one of the buildings. The public areas are actually quite smart and clean but this didn't reflect the quality of the room. My room was quite small considering this is a 'City' hotel. The fixtures and fittings were quite worn; the 'safe' had actually come away from the wall so I certainly wasn't going to trust any of my belongings to it! My room had a large freestanding fan a sign that the room could get very hot - which it did making getting a good night's sleep on the first night quite difficult. I accidentally flooded the bathroom the next morning due to a leak behind the bath taps. As you can see in the picture the seals are mouldy. The bathroom is in need of a refit. At breakfast the food and service were below standard. It took ages before I was asked whether I'd like tea or coffee. The bread rolls and croissants seemed stale beans were starting to congeal and hash browns were hard. There were no spoons on the breakfast table to stir coffee with. While checking out I wasn't asked whether I'd enjoyed my stay. Presumably they're not interested in making sure their guests have a good experience.,Rich_F_UK
UR22336739,2008-1-December,We stayed at this hotel for a weekend in London. The room was booked at a competative rate which seemed good for a 4 star hotel. On arrival the hotel were unable to provide a doule room but offered 2 singles. The rooms were tiny dirty in urgent need of redecoration and the supposedly non-smoking rooms reaked of cigarette smoke. For the duration of our stay trays with half eaten room service were left in the corridors and stair wells. We were really suporsed by the poor quality and standard of service for this hotel from a reputable chain. If you want a budget price hotel in London for a weekend -l ook elsewhere.,Maidoc
UR6940335,2007-9-March,This was without doubt the smallest hotel room in history and for 150 pounds a night (which thankfully I wasn't paying for) the hotel should have been flying a jolly roger flag outside!!! When laying on the single bed I was able to reach across the room and touch both walls at the same time..I think perhaps they accidentally put me in the cleaners cupboard?! The room was old and well past its sell by datealthough I understand from other reviews and a colleague also staying here that the refurbished rooms are nicer.if at check-in they say you are in the second building my recommendation is to check out!! The food and staff were helpful of an evening in the bar although service at breakfast when it came to getting tea coffee or toast wasnt the bestthe buffet was good though. All in all when next Im working up in London I think I will be trying somewhere else before returning here.,Penguin2004
UR6564391,2007-8-January,My friend and i went on a bus trip and stayed at this hotel. The room was tiny and did not have a lot going for it. The beds were clean and comfortable but we found a TICK in one of them. It was taken to reception who were horrified but no compensation or upgrade offered. Lets hope the room was cleaned thorougly before any one else stayed in it. Sadly did not take a camera so no photos available.,TICKBUG
UR6763464,2007-8-February,I stayed at the Thistle City for 3 nights in February and even though it was a company booking I'll ensure the next time I'm in London I won't be staying at the Thistle City. There is nothing horrendously wrong with this hotel but so many crucial elements are not what the could (or should) be that I won't choose to stay their again. The service at reception is poor. If nothing else its aggravating when you're trying to check in at 10pm and standing in a line of 6-8 people while only 1 of the 4 staff at the reception desk is trying to work through that line. When you do reach your room its clean but small and cramped with a 15 inch TV that is would be more a home in a small B&B. The hotel is also pretty poorly insulated for sound... once I turned in for the night a fair amount of street noise is audible. I got up to check if the window was open but it wasn't. It was simply old and it rattled enough in its frame for you to be able to realise why the street noise came in so easily. Resigning myself to the fact there was little I could do about it I returned to bed to listen to the man in the room next door call his wife (maybe) to say goodnight. I really don't expect to hear conversations from the room next door in a decent hotel in this day and age. All of the issues above are something you can choose to put up with if you thought you were getting value for money or ideally located. However given the price this hotel charges for an inadequate product and poor service then I'll chose to give my business to another hotel.,HilBil
UR7799904,2007-7-June,I stayed here last novemeber whilst on a training course with work. From the moment I checked in I was shocked by the disticnt lasck of customer service and focus. The room looked like something out of a Frank Spencer sketch the room smelt damp it was cold EVEN with the heater on which made the room smell even worse ! The TV signal was shoddy to say the least. The bathroom was ....well old not to a high clean standard. I even bought bottled water to brush my teeth with as the taps were filthy underneath ! I was unfortunate to stay in the older part but even so the ammount of money to stay there was extortonate to say the least. I would rather stay in a travel lodge next time. 60 tops for a clean nice room. You know what your getting. These were the worst 3 nights I have ever spent at a hotel I couldn't wait to check out ! Even the staff didn't thank me for my stay and were rude when giving me my recipt for my expenses. Avoid at all costs !,KatJam7
UR6750178,2007-6-February,Stayed in this hotel for 4 nights - I had stayed here 8 years ago and when I approached the hotel remembered how bad it was previously. Thistle now run the hotel and they have tried to tidy it up but it needs refreshing again. The room was clean and well maintained but if your after a room with a view find another hotel. The building is a little odd and split in to 2 halves - if your in the opposite side to reception then you could end up with a view of a wall. I don't think I opened the curtains for the whole time I was there because the view was so depressing. Breakfast was busy on the days I was there but the selection was good. I used the room service on the first night which came to 22 for a sandwich and a drink!! On another night I stayed in for food which was very good but the service was poor. There is a pool and gym in this hotel which is small but luckily quiet on the days I was there. Luckily I stayed here on a business trip as the standard room rate is 180 per night. For that kind of money you can do a lot better. I'm not sure if there are any tourist attractions near here - I wouldn't recommend this hotel for anything other than business travel.,Chem73
UR7771745,2007-5-June,I was put in this hotel by the bank I'm working for. No way on earth is this a four star hotel. After speaking to colleagues some of the rooms have been decorated so some people might be lucky and get a newly decorated room. I wasn't lucky. The furniture was easily 25 years old. The windows were noisy (I was two floors up and I could hear people coughing in the street below). I didn't need curtains as the windows were so dirty they were blacked out. The bathroom was old tile grout was orange where it hadn't been cleaned. I put the soap into the soap holder on the wall which then fell off the wall. AVOID THIS PLACE. The staff were friendly and helpful but that's it.,Business_Traveller_7
UR8060864,2007-5-July,Total dump nothing in the hotel works. What an absolute hole!,as-man82
UR6555667,2007-5-January,I stayed here overnight on business in mid-December 2006. There were quite a few people checking in at the same time from my company but one of the computers on reception was unable to process our reservations so we all had a long wait to check in. When we finally got checked in the room (a standard twin) had clearly seen better days. The facilities were pretty basic. We had a few drinks in the bar at the rear of the hotel later on which had a pleasant enough atmosphere and we also had some pizzas (which were incredibly hot with chilli!). The following morning there seemed to be a problem with the water pressure and I couldn't get the shower to stay on - the lever you pull up to switch the water from the bath tap to the shower head kept dropping back down so I had to hold it up with one hand while trying to wash my hair with the other. This was a problem several of my colleagues encountered too. Outside my room the corridor smelt strongly of stale fried food so I skipped breakfast. All in all this hotel is really just somewhere to lay your head for the night - don't expect much more!,NikG
UR11263133,2007-5-December,As others have said this is in a bad location for central London - it's a 15 minute walk from the nearest tube Barbican. My room was small and cramped. The TV was a tiny CRT model. The bathroom was fairly crap too - all old and with the shower not working properly. The Thistle's not bad but you can do much better in London,0898
UR12167594,2007-31-December,The Hotel is quite difficult to find. It is a good 10 minute walk from the nearest tube at Old Street and is basically in a back street in a non to pleasant area of London. Check-in was quite and pleasant and I was told my room had been upgraded free of charge so I was really pleased and looking forward to an enjoyable stay. However the upgraded room was still below my expectation of what you should get when paying mor than 100 a night. It was old and things were worn and broken. The furniture was chiped and scratched the bathroom was basic and nothing more. The room was not large there was just enough room to move around the double bed and that was it. Room service was average and I did not have breakfast in the hotel as this was not included in my room. I would not stay here again unless I had no choice and I am sure I can find better Hotels in London for the same price as the Thistle Barbican is charging.,Phil1982
UR7276129,2007-3-April,This hotel is by far the worst I have ever stayed in. The location is in a very quiet and very unsavoury area of the city. We were quite surprised to find the room was actually OK until we tried to use the bathroom. We had no hot water for the whole of our 2 night stay and other guests we were with had no water at all. We were told numerous times that the problem would be solved in half an hour. That half an hour turned into 48 hours!! The staff were most unfriendly and unhelpful and didnt really care at all that we had not been able to take a shower during our stay. There was a huge queue at reception of people complaining and all the Manager did was hold up his arms in dismay and walk off!! The breakfast was just as bad. No cutlery no cups for the coffee one houshold toaster for do it yourself toast between the whole dining room resulting in a wait of 15 minutes for a slice of toast. Take my advise and steer well clear of this hotel that is run on a par with Fawlty Towers!,blondebutnotstupid
UR7482027,2007-29-April,I thought the Bloomsbury Thistle was the pits of London hotels till last week when I stayed here. Wallpaper was falling off the walls of the room. I was put in a smoker despite booking a non smoker and couldn't change room. The shower didn't function breakfast was also poor coffee was like treacle buffet was poor luke warm cardboard bacon and crusty scrambled eggs. Staff looked generally unhappy and on checkout nobody bothered to ask how my stay had been. Poor response to complaints about the room and clearly used to it. Poor value for money poor service poor accommodation. Check out the photos.,Wiganrover
UR6892553,2007-28-February,I stayed in this Hotel in January whilst I was in Central London on company business their choice of hotel not mine. First impressions were not favourable mainly due to the terrible location : right in the middle of a high rise council estate. I felt rather uneasy walking there from Old Street tube station on a Sunday night. Check-in was OK but the room was cold very small & looked like it had seen better days. Tried breakfast once it was fair but terribly overpriced (they insisted my company booking at 90 per night did not include breakfast) . In the evenings I walked to Angel tube station to get into Central London to eat. I made sure I was back by 9:00 pm though ! On the plus side the Hotel do offer a free shuttle service in the mornings to Old Street tube which was very welcome. Overall I really cannot recommand this Hotel sorry. Tube Tip : It's been years since I last stayed in Central London and the 4 minimum tube fare was eye watering. I purchased an Oyster card on the Sunday evening : 23 for 7 days unlimited tube travel areas 1 & 2 : bargain ! Food Tip : Mr Wu's Chinese Buffet (Irving Street just off Leicester Square) is amazing. All you can eat for 4.95. I ate there some years previously so I simply had to try them again. Excellent food for the price I wonder if there's anywhere else in the UK (never mind London) offering such good value.,Pumpkin_Pies_R_Us
UR6850670,2007-27-February,Stayed for 3 nights 9-12 Feb My daughter mum sister and niece. We were very tired arriving into Kings Cross 20:20 qued for taxi to take us to hotel 8 lady at the taxi rank ushered you to a cab so no que jumping about 15 min trip to hotel. Check in was slow I had phoned the week before to request rooms close to each other as we were a family they gave us 1 room on floor 3 and 1 room on floor 6! Requested rooms closer together to be told none available the man I spoke to a week earlier came out and said he would try and get us nearer together the next day so off we went. Floor 3 was recently refurbished and looked lovely our kids were very impressed.....they must have run out of money after that floor as floor 6 was like stepping back in time! Our room was clean but small for 3. As we were settling in reception called to say they could move us from floor 3 up to floor 5!!Not a chance her room was lovely! I said we would wait  He then found he could move us to floor 2 so we said that would be great the upgrade room was a sofa bed and you would have broken your back if you slept on it for 3 days not even suitable for a child. When it was out you couldnt open the wardrobe spoke to the reception again and told him not acceptable we would make do with the tatty room on floor 6! As if by magic another room for 3 was found  a suite no less!! we checked this out and although it was a sofa bed it was far superior to the other and you could get to the wardrobes!by this time it was 10:20pm. Air con easy to control outside noise was noticable we overlooked a block of residential flats and it got quite colourful at some times breaking windows etc...Breakfast was great we filled up for the dayswe taxid most places but on the sunday concierge told us which bus to take from City Road very easy kids free on a weekend standard price of 2 per adult discovered you can buy a day ticked for 3.50 and go anywhere within 2 zones ideal if your doing the touristy things like we were. Didnt go out on an evening as the area isnt over good the security at the hotel was excellant they didnt allow people to be hanging around. The pool was excellant main reason we chose this hotel the kids loved it free towels spa steam room pool quite they had a ball! The restaurant only serves carvery on a weekend and this needs addressing we only wanted a meal of the bar menu but were told we could not have this in the restaurant. They did accomodate us with a special price for the carvery and did the kids at a special rate.Wewere leaving London late that evening and they allowed us to leave our luggage there all day the rain cut short our last dayso we asked if we could order some food sit have a coffe and get warm and dry till we left this was not a problem. On the whole they tried their best to accomodate us a little more careful planning with rooms when families are involved and a change to the menu in the restaurant and this could be a wonderful base for a family in London.,MissNorthYorks
UR11069218,2007-26-November,Having stayed at other Thistles I expected this hotel to be of the same standard. Checking in was all fine but upon entering the room we were severley disapointed! The room was in the old side of the building and was tiny and looked like something you would expect from a budget hotel. The TV was on the floor the decor was old peeling and generally the whole room was just a mess. Upon asking if we could swap rooms we were told the only way we could is if we were to pay 20 which was worth it to move from that room! We ended up over in the new side and the room was much nicer and more what you would expect. However breakfast in the morning was like nothing I'd seen before! It was chaos - there was hardly any warm food out people who had continental vouchers were helping themselves to cooked breakfasts as there was no-one checking these in fact someone could have just walked in off the street and helped themselves to anything! The food was cold there were no staff around to ask for help not enough tables the toasters had broken. All in all we waited about half an hour to get a cold breakfast. Also service at the reception bar both days we were there was terrible! All in all I would not stay here again I have stayed in much nicer and better staffed hotels in London for a cheaper price!,rachscott1
UR7226493,2007-26-March,was not expecting to much after reading other reviews. paid 108 for 2 nights fri/sat for twin room through last minute if i had paid anymore i would not have been happy. ok if your just using it as a base. leisure facility 4 star hotel lobby etc 3 star rooms 2 star. our room was clean but shabby. 10 minutes from barbican station.,theflyingtrader
UR8237551,2007-26-July,Arrived at the hotel with high expectations (4 Stars in London). The reception/foyer gave a good impression of the hotel. Then you get given your room. The standard single rooms are small and come without airconditioning. After complaining to the reception staff (most of whom do not speak english) I was eventually upgraded to a deluxe twin with air con and room to move around. The restaurant facilities are also poor. Breakfast was included with the booking and I was given 5 coupons to use each morning. Due to the lack of communication between hotel staff you can que for 10-15mins while waiting to be seated with your coupon in your hand. (like being back at school and queing for lunch). The only plus side to the hotel is the leisure facilities. The Swimming Pool Jacuzzi Sauna and Steam Room are all good and there is a gym which is a little on the small side and could use better ventilation. My general impression of the hotel was poor. The staff are helpful when and if they understand you. If you're looking for accommodation in london go elsewhere. You'll get better facilities service and value for money from Travel Inn.,hotelreviewer101
UR11052740,2007-25-November,My second time here each time only there because my usual hotel was full. Not a favourite - room was very small last time but ok for size this time. But the biggest problem is that the hotel is not in the City is not at the Barbican and is not near many good restaurants or sights or cinemas. Breakfast OK check in busy but not too slow.,petmarscrims
UR11021377,2007-24-November,Where to start ! The slowest check-in and check-out I've come across in a while; tiny claustrophobic room - though I'm a small man I couldn't fit in the bath; lighting so bad in the bathroom that shaving was hit and miss; decor so run down that the window frame was down to the bare wood; excessive heating but no ability to control it & window wouldn't open; squeaky door that must have woken the whole floor when I got back late; no eggs at breakfast because cooking staff "too busy"; stone cold cooked breakfast (at 6.45am !); disgusting mug of coffee that tasted of hot water (at a time when London is awash with quality coffee shops). And all for 93GBP. What a bargain.,Levelheaded
UR10227483,2007-22-October,this is the worst hotel any one can stay at. but i would say the staff were good but they were over exhausted and underpaid. i asked one of the staff about this and he told me that the upper management were worst to work with.operational manager was so bad that he wanted to leaave the hotewl as soon as possible. it ws completely bad hotel in all.,knower
UR8215903,2007-22-July,I booked this hotel as a top secret hotel through a website. I was happy to find out that it was a Thisle as they have a good reputation. However when I arrived I was not overly impressed. To start with the reception staff were very slow at checking us in. We had booked a double room and they tried to put us in a twin room but the receptionist said she would upgrade us to a delux double; great we thought until we saw the size of the room. It was clean with a good size bathroom (with a good working shower) and the eminities all set for a working stay but the rest of the room was very small in comparison to some Travelodges and small B&Bs we've stayed in. The air conditioning was a little hard to program at first and was a little noisy (but an essential as the room got so hot). The pool area is lovely. The staff down there the steam room sauna spa pool and main pool are really clean and quiet at the time we went down. No faults there at all. We ordered room serive for the first time ever as it was a special weekend. It took 3 attempts to get the correct cutlery up to us 2 forks 2 knives and 2 spoons. Not hard you would think. We did consider adding breakfast to our bill until we found out it was 17.50 each for a buffet! On the whole the room was clean the pool was lovely but the hotel is a little out of the way and with the nearest tube a good 15 mins walk away and the staff were not as helpful as you would think. I won't go back there.,KezzinDorset
UR7198377,2007-21-March,this hotel is billed as a 4 star hotel and we've stayed in better 2 star B&B's. my wife and i stayed for 3 days/2 nights and never once did a memeber of staff talk in a polite manner the cleaner cleaned our room at 4.30pm and left it smelling of B.O the conceierge wwas as much use as a chocolate fireguard as EVERY THING was to much trouble and the double deluxe room was like a shoe box! enough said!,de_livio
UR8205632,2007-20-July,This hotel is quite neglected. The windows need to be cleaned on the outside and things remain in a state of disrepair. The kettle was hidden away and when I took it out it didn't work but they brought me up another one. The staff were fine but this hotel is obviously badly managed. It was definately clean though.,Jenny108
UR7539800,2007-2-May,This is a run down hotel that is best avoided. The rooms are small and badly designed with poor furniture lumpy matresses and tired decorations. The facilities you would normally expect are often missing e.g. no tissues. It is comparatively expensive. It is not even near the Barbican! A good 10 minute stroll to the Barbican Centre - OK on a nice day but probably a taxi at other times. It is difficult to find positives - half the staff were friendly & efficient. The cooked breakfast would have been good if it had been hot but it was only warm. The only saving grace is the fish restaurant across the road - Fish Central. This is a chip shop that has expanded on the back of success - formica tables but a range of fish dishes (not just fried) and specials served by friendly and knowledgeable staff. Its a gem!,Brunlea
UR6539659,2007-2-January,Avoid this hotel at all costs. The staff are stupid and inefficient. They lost my reservation via lastminute (done 3 weeks previously so no excuse for lastminute). Not being able to process internet reservations seems to be a feature of the Thistle chain (happened 3 times previously to me in a Thistle hotel). The room was dreary clapped out tiny windows were locked and no airconditioning - simply utterly ghastly. The only positive thing is that the room was clean but that's all. I left this hotel the next morning at 5 am - I will never stay in a Thistle hotel again in my life.,Travelbug-TRIP
UR8281032,2007-2-August,On arrival the hotel looked very nice the reception area bar etc. Slight delay in checking in but was given a complimentary upgrade (from a standard double to a deluxe double) so so far so good. The journey to the room made a good impression nice lift hallways and once in the room i wasn't disappointed. Although it was a little small this is London after all. We had specifically asked for a quiet room (as my girlfriend had had an operation at the nearby Moorfields Eye Hospital) but there was constant banging and drilling going on somewhere in the hotel for the whole afternoon. This was only able to be drowned out by putting on the world's noisiest air conditioning unit. It was simpy impossible to sleep with this unit on and this created problems on the night as the room became quite hot indeed. We did eat in the hotel on the night taking advantage of their carvery buffet. The food was pleasant however strangley there was no gravy for the carvery? Overall the hotel was ok but we were unfortunately unable to have the peaceful and restful stay that we were hoping for. Although it must be said the hotel is very convenient for anyone visiting Moorfields Hospital as this is only a short walk away. If visiting the area again i think i would look into an alternative place to stay.,BirminghamSpengler
UR7269105,2007-2-April,First room we were given had two single beds an over site I can accept that no problem. We were then moved to another room this one having a double bed. Unpacked and then went off out for the evening. We returned not too late about 10PM looking forward to a nice warm shower before turning in for the night no hot water. Rang the front desk and was informed the water would be hot in the morning. Went to sleep and was woken up by a vibrating / whistling noise that was extremely loud this went on through out the night despite my attempts to discover where this noise was coming from. Woke after eventually having an hours unbroken sleep and made my way to the shower no hot water. Rang the desk and was not able to gain any time as to when the water would be hot made do with a cold one. Left for the day then returned about 5PM for a shower and shave before going to a show and a bite to eat in china town no hot water no water at all in fact. Then complained about the noise from the room after discovering it was the window frame not sealed properly the wind was whipping through the gaps causing the vibration and the whistling noises. Eventually managed to shower in the sports club then left for the evening. Returned at just past midnight and the room had hot water so I looked forward to the hot shower in the morning. Awoke about AM went to the bathroom for a shower. No water again. By this point both I and my partner were severely peeved about the whole situation. After another call to reception we were told the whole street was without water.. Not true as the staff in the restaurant told us they were informed all the issues had been resolved and the water was running fine now. I guess the main complaint is the fact that no one informed us we had a room with no water for our whole stay and the team at the hotel was not particularly bothered about the situation. To add insult to injury both the lifts were out of order and there was a number of old people having to walk up six flights of stairs to reach there room. I was a member of a 200 strong party stopping at the hotel who had pre paid had I been a regular guest I would have refused to pay my bill outright as I felt the whole situation was a farce and if the management is of that caliber through out the chain then I will never stop at this chain again ever. 1 bad experience yes I can accept 48 hours with no water two lifts broken down a room with a window frame not sealed correctly a child could push out sorry but this is just another fine example of poor management maintenance and customer service.,okenfold
UR10919860,2007-19-November,I was forced to stay in this hotel through my study abroad program and it was by far the worst hotel I have ever encountered. No redeeming qualities: awful location cramped and dirty rooms and completely useless staff. The shower was not working the lifts were broken and I was on the sixth floor and the concierge knew absolutely nothing about London other than how to get to the nearest tube station which anyone could figure out themselves. If you're like me and have to stay at this place due to a package/program I feel your pain but if you have any choice DO NOT STAY HERE.,smass35
UR7186847,2007-18-March,I stay in quite a few hotels and this has to be the worst. Avoid like the plague. I tried to remain neutral after the hotel was booked and I had checked reviews but I arrived and the single room was tiny with no room to place an ironing board up. Complained and got moved to a twin room. Wardrobe doors hanging off television didn't work shower mixer was faulty and more. At least the linen was clean! The staff just seem to accept that everyone is unhappy. There were loads complaining during my one night stay. Thankfully it was just somewhere to rest my head and nothing else. Never again never,Guess24
UR8141086,2007-18-July,Dreadful.I strongly advise anyone who is contemplating staying here to reconsider. I booked a two night stay as part of a theatre break package with superbreaks & I'm currently going through a dispute with them because it was bloody awful. The minute we arrived things started to go wrong. The staff in the hotel are primarily foreign (which I have nothing against but it would be nice if they understand more than two words of English!) were rude and ignorant. We arrived on my fiance's birthday and found ourselves waiting in the entrance for an hour and a half with other unsatisfied guests just to check in. We were told the systems had crashed. When we finally received 'our' key we opened the door to find a man stood there in his boxer shorts ironing his shirt! The situation was extremely embarrassing and we went downstairs to get another key and the staff just brushed it off as nothing. When we went to our new room we had trouble with the locks it would take at least eight attempts for the card to register our iron was broke the bathroom was filthy- there was filthy grime embedded in between the tiles the shower did not work and a pathetic dribble of water came out of the tap. We had to clean our teeth out of the bath tap and take a shower downstairs in the gym changing rooms. It was a COMPLETE JOKE. Despite our complaints about the room nothing was done and we were even promised a luxury room after our original encounter with the unfortunate man in his underwear. The hotel refurbishment looks straight out of the eighties it is such a dive please don't be fooled be the glossy photos like us. Yes the hotel has a gym and pool and that is actually quite nice but the facilities and filthy standards certainly disqualify this. The showers all need ripping out and replacing- they look straight out of Hitchcock's 'Psycho' - no kidding ! Morning breakfast was poor too can you believe that some hotels actually still water down the pure orange juice? (how trampy can you get!) Or every other juice they had for that matter. The English breakfast was lukewarm with rubbery bacon and the fresh croissants they had just put out were stale mmm really appetising. Location of hotel is extremely poor indeed smack bang in the middle of a deprived council estate of high rise flats- funny how they never mention this on the website!! The nearest train station is Old Street which 15 mins away not good though as you have to change trains and walking to and from the station really does swallow up your time (plus we could do without the worry of getting mugged!) Needless to stay we will not be staying at this hotel again and I strongly advise you stay to reconsider your stay. I just hope my review helps someone make an informed decision which I would have done. If I had known about this site before I had blown s for our holiday I would not have booked this shabby hotel in a million years.,hjcat
UR7161807,2007-14-March,This is my first time I stayed in the Barbican Thistle Hotel and I will never forget the experience. I stayed on the 6th floor; it always smelt of bacon and chip fat. The rooms where terrible student like accomodations oops sorry the student accommodations are much nicer. I would not recommend this place to anyone. I have stayed in many hotels around London and this is the worst by far.,Honest-73
UR8699894,2007-12-September,Probably the worst hotel I have ever encountered. The rooms are awful: small dirty horrible bathrooms peeling paint smelly drains TV didn't work no aircon minibar not stocked. dirty linen. Communal areas are dirty and shabby with peeling paint and filthy carpets. Food was inedible. Truly awful. I ended up going to a takeaway instead. God knows why anyone would stay here. It is not fit for livestock. Avoid this place like the plague.,Andy4000
UR7014941,2007-12-March,We booked the Thistle City Barbican as part of a joint show/hotel package (we went to see "Wicked" which is a great show and well worth seeing). I was quite happy to stay here as I was born very close by so it gave me the chance to show my wife where I was born and see how much had changed/I could remember (moved away when I was five). As for the hotel? Well it is not cheap - in fact it is an expensive hotel but then I suppose you are paying for the location (very close to the northern edge of the City and the Barbican Centre is nearby). Good points: The hotel staff are friendly if perhaps not the best communicators. Bed was extremely comfortable - we both got a great night's sleep. The swimming pool sauna steam room and jacuzzi were excellent if perhaps a little small. Breakfast was very enjoyable and great quality. A nice touch is the courtesy bus that takes guests to local tube stations - again obviously angled at guests who are there to do business in the City. Bad points: The room is very small given the cost. Communications were not the best - for example the tea/coffee making facilities were hidden away in a double-drawer cunningly designed to look like two single drawers. No sign explained this so unless you hunted/nosed through all the drawers you had no idea where they were. The TV reception was appalling. There were other little niggles like the light in the wardrobe that was supposed to switch off when the door was closed... but didn't. Or the price list in the room that made it seem like the pool area was subject to an additional charge (it wasn't but we had to check). Or the lack of information in the room about when breakfast was available. Or the light fitting that wasn't quite fitting to the wall. Or the lift that didn't stop flush with the floor - we saw a couple of people trip due to this. Given that this is an expensive hotel to stay at personally I would expect things to be perfect... and they were not. If you are staying on your own as part of a business trip someone else is footing the bill and you need to be close to the City without actually being right in the middle then this hotel will satisfy your needs. But for what you get it is an awful lot of money and I would look elsewhere if you are paying the bill.,BOBJP
UR7012181,2007-11-March,My second stay in this hotel. This time spent 4 nights in a 6th floor room. The entire floor smelled like grease (or bacon or something). Shower didn't work. Electric outlets didn't work. Lousy breakfast. Won't be staying here again.,the_bystander_77
UR11478968,2007-11-December,London: Thristle City Barbican Date : December 2007 Reviewer A TripAdvisor member Athens Greece i stayed at this hotel for one week in december 2007 .I met some problems during my stayng.The key to the door did not operate all the times .So every time i had to go to the reception in order to fix the problem with the key.The delux room i was given was small with a view at the rear of the hotel.The average price per night was high for that room .When i entered the room for the first time it was very cold and noone told me at the reception what to do in order to put on the heat.I had to guess .The aircondioning in the room did not operate.Only by chance i turned the knobs of the central heating and the room warmed up. The flash in the bathroom did not oparate properly.However the biggest problem of this hotel is its location.Although it is located in a quiet area however It is far from everywhere.One has to take at least two trains and one bus to arrive from i.e soho to the hotel.There is a shuttle bus from the hotel to the nearest tube stations at specified times.but when one gets out of the tube station either has to walk 15-20 minutes to the hotel or to wait the bus outside the tube station and then walk 5 minutes to the hotel. There are not much choices at breakfast. for a 4 stars hotel .I had dinner at the hotel twice .I had the impression that the food i ate was not prepared the same day. The stuff of the hotel was very kind and Friendly and they listen very carfully to the complaints of the guests and they did their best to solve the problems,ADRAS
UR10062711,2007-10-October,I had stayed twice before at this hotel and had always been pleased with my stay. I hadn't stayed there for about 2 years and it has got really shabby in that time. The first room I was shown to was small and stank of stale smoke despite being a non smoking room. I called reception and asked to change rooms which was fine. I had to go down to reception for a new key. The new room was equally small and quite dark but was adequate if rather shabby. The ironing board was broken. I asked for a new one which took 3 phone calls and almost 2 hours to arrive! The hair dryer in the bathroom was about as much use as using nothing! However the room was quiet and my room service meal was ok but VERY expensive - 24 for fish & chips and 1 glass of wine!! My room was quiet and the speedy check out service valuable. Breakfast was very good and a good selection. The hotel swimming pool and sauna and gym are also very good. All in all ok for a one night busines trip and a cheap rate for central london.,EggBristol
UR6898447,2007-1-March,This hotel is probably the worst hotel I've stayed in. Sites are far away service is horrible. Well overpriced for the services. The card key kept demagnetizing no ice buckets electrical screwed up have to rent adapters and pay for their internet service. I don't mind paying but i do mind paying over 150 pounds with an additional 10 pounds a day for internet. The ironing board is way to small and the iron is not very good. Overall I give this hotel a 0! Way to expensive and way off the sites.,babowski
UR6342875,2006-7-December,My corporate office is around the corner from this hotel and I dread having to stay there everytime I come to London for meetings. I guess I should just start by saying what doesn't go wrong? They've lost my reservations on more than one occasion I've experienced dirty rooms with showers not working properly (the trick is to jam the chain under the pull) keys don't work T.V doesnt work food not what I ordered clueless staff hairdryer broken etc. etc. the list goes on. It is just an overall experience of aggrevation that I don't need at the end of the day. If it is convenient I would stay somewhere else.,Kateky
UR4939268,2006-5-April,I booked a room via British Airways at this hotel and BA advertised it as a 4-star hotel. It definitely isn't. While I knew it was fairly far from any tourist venues I thought it would make up for the distance in being a really superb hotel. I was very disappointed. The hotel has two towers and the first room I was booked into was dark with a moldy bath a small television on a spindly tripod and little else. It had peeling paint on the walls stained ceiling tiles from previous leaks and the hallways leading to the room were so badly cared for I thought I had been booked into a flophouse. I visited the front desk and quietly said that this was advertised by BA as a 4-star hotel and said in my opinion it wasn't. The staff were unfailingly courteous throughout my stay and in this instance kindly changed my room to one in the main tower which they said was their superior deluxe. It was better no question but it still didn't live up to the 4-star rating. The paint was still badly stained and chipped the wallpaper stained and peeling stained ceiling tiles and the maid service was extremely spotty. I left tips every day and had to write a list of what I needed (i.e. new soap enough towels extra coffee packets etc.). If I didn't leave a note I didn't get anything except a bed made and one clean towel. I wouldn't recommend this hotel at all. It's too far away from anything a visitor might want to see and involves a lengthy walk to the nearest bus stop or the Barbican Underground station and the hotel does not qualify for any 4-star rating. If you're looking for 4 stars or if you want to be somewhat conveniently close to tourist attractions then book a different hotel.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR5555528,2006-4-August,We tried at least seven times to book our room via the group booking and each time was told that they didn't exist or that all the rooms were booked under their grouping. Eventually after the soon to be Bride and Groom shouted at someone in the hotels booking centre I was told the next time I rang not to get off the telephone until someone sorted it out. They also gave me a name of a Thistle manager to use as leverage. So I tried for a final time and refused to take no as an answer eventually they informed me the booking was on the next screen down where no one had bothered to check. When they finally tried to book the room which they had mysteriously found they told me there was a problem with the computer system and they could only book one person into the room and not the both of us but they told me that they would put a note on the reservation to say there would be two of us. No one sent me a confirmation email or anything by post I had to telephone and request confirmation which was then sent. When we arrived at the hotel there was a small queue in front of us but only one person checking in/out at reception. There were however at least five people behind the desk trying to ignore the growing queue it was as if they didn't want our money. Eventually I had to ask in a loud voice if there were going to be anyone else checking people in and immediately three members of staff decided they would help check in people. The woman checking us in had a bad grasp of English and could not understand what we were saying and we could not understand her badly broken English. Another of the wedding party had started being checked in at the same time as us and had been checked in ten minutes before we eventually managed to get checked in. We had travelled a long way to get to the hotel and the lack of communication left us standing at reception for over 20 minutes while she tried to find our room cards our booking on the system they fact it only said one person on the booking because of the initally computer problems when we booked. She then informed us that breakfast finished at 10 am on a Saturday and a Sunday the other members of the booking group were told 10.30am and 11am. When we managed to get our room keys we had to ask where the lifts were as this information was not forthcoming when we got to the fourth floor the blast of hot air hit us as if we were in a furnace. There was no air conditioning or windows open in the corridors the carpet was ripped in places and our room was located down a corridor so badly lit that at night you could hardly see where you were going several of the lights had blown and noone had bothered to change them. The extractor fan in our bathroom was not working and there was mould on the shower curtain other than that the room was fine other than it being tiny. On Saturday night after the wedding I went back to our hotel room and tried to watch some television as I was getting changed an old message suddenly appeared from Friday night. After trying to delete the message time after time with no luck I rang down to reception and no one bothered to answer so I had to physically go down to reception and ask them to sort it out which they did I missed the end of the film I was watching. The breakfast each morning was very average I have stayed in many hotels where the breakfast was to a very high standard so I know an average breakfast when I experience one. The staff could not speak english well enough to deal with any requests and I had the distinct impression that they didn't want to be there complaining to each other within earshot of the customers. All in all quite a disappointment I will never stay at this hotel again and will be telling all my friends and family how bad it is. It also makes me question whether I should stay at any other Thistle Hotel in this country. If this is the general standard of service and quality then I shall never step back into another Thistle Hotel and will actively discourage anyone else I know from staying at the chain.,Images
UR4823584,2006-31-March,When I say terrible that might be a bit extreme but I really didn't enjoy my stay here. Was on business and got a "cheap" deal for 69. It really wasn't worth that and is a pretty dodgy area. Felt a bit tense walking around as a lone female. Room was nice clean and I slept very well on the good mattress. Pool was also nice albeit a bit of a trek to get there. Staff barely speak English. The restaurant was the real let down. Awful overpriced overcooked food with grumpy waiters and chef. They obviously don't have a clue how to cook. After I'd paid for my overcooked "carvery buffet" (like eating leather soles) I told them it was awful. Although they brought the chef over to talk to me they couldn't really justify why it was so bad. I wasn't offered a refund (even though I ate very little) and when I did get a letter to apologise there was still no offer of any compensation. Avoid this place and their restaurant.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR4399710,2006-31-January,Myself and my partner booked a room through Lastminute.com. We booked a 4* room with double bed and breakfast. We arrived at the hotel after walking through the council estate and greeted by a foreign receptionist who told us that we could only have a double bed if we paid the 20 quid upgrade fee! We showed her our booking confirmation that said 'Double bed' and she said that we could only have a basic single for the price we had paid. We decided just to take the single beds as we were only there for 1 night. In the morning we went for our English Breakfast but we noticed that out tickets only said Continental so we could only have the cold food. That was ok for me as I don't eat cooked breakfast but my partner does so once again we were fobbed off. The room we were given was only set up for 1 person with 1 set of shampoos and stuff and 1 set of towels 1 packet of biscuits etc so we were definately fobbed off for booking through a travel agent. We could have booked a hotel in Kensington for the same price and we wish we had!,122109b
UR4742535,2006-29-March,Never has a hotel divided opinion so much! It is in a fairly ropey area but I felt perfectly safe walking back to the hotel late at night though I wouldn't like the thought of my sister doing the same thing.... It is also nowhere near the Barbican.... The key to this place is ask when you check in 'to be in the new building' ie where the actual check in as these rooms are the better ones by a long shot. In the older building it is not nearly so pleasant and not to be recommended. Breakfast was fine and plentiful though you had to walk through a very smokey area to access the breakfast section. Service was good from all members of staff. Overall a reasonable stay but given the choice not somewhere I would stay............,A TripAdvisor Member
UR5724521,2006-29-August,We have stayed in 2 other Thistle hotels in London so we were expecting a reasonable hotel. In fact this was probably the worst hotel experience for both my partner and I. The room was small extremely ugly in very poor condition and the walls paper thin so we were unable to sleep for hearing our neighbours talk and snore. The safe box was locked and nonone could apparently do anything about it. The location is not even convenient for a visitor to London I would advise anyone thinking about staying here to think again. Almost anywhere else has to be better.,garfield1948
UR5876970,2006-26-September,I can't even begin to describe how unenjoyable my trip was. There is no air-con and I couldn't open my window due to the fact that there were kids outside with very big dogs who were barking constantly. Not somewhere I felt safe. TV also had a very old-fashioned set-up with an aeriel stuck in the back of the set. As a result practically no reception.,Caitrionamay
UR5836409,2006-25-September,Please please please no matter how tempted you are to book a room at this hotel - don't especially if you are in London sightseeing. The rooms are small dirty in need of refurbishment (unless you like 70's retro!) and like mini furnaces. The hotel is in the middle of a council estate miles from the nearest tube in a 'run down' part of London the restaurant is grim and nobody appears to speak English! I had two nights in this dump at 164 a night!! and was glad to leave - fortunately my employer was picking up the tab.,dollychops
UR4518822,2006-25-February,I have just returned from a two night stay at the Thistle Barbican and having read previous reviews was somewhat apprehensive about staying there. The location isn't great and it's certainly more than a 10 minute walk from the Barbican.Our room wasn't ready when we checked in at 1pm so we had to wait an hour. Our room was in the building opposite reception - apparently these rooms are the standard rooms. The bathroom although small was clean with enough towels.Overall the room was adequate although the peeling wallpaper under the desk was somewhat off putting.The hair dryer didn't work but following a call to reception was replaced in minutes.Breakfast was average with a reasonable choice.Staff generally were pleasant and helpful. Overall this is definately not a four star hotel and definately not worth the normal rates.It's not bad if you get a cheap deal but I wouldn't be returning.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR4499728,2006-24-February,I stayed here whilst working in the City for 2 nights. The location is poor it is 8-10 for a taxi into the city each morning. I had booked a double room and pre-paid for it but on checking in was told that they had no standard doubles available (it was before 5pm!) so I was given a twin room. The room was shabby the bathroom was tiny and smelt musty - the sort of bathroom where you will take a shower but not a bath. The mattress was very old and had no spring left. I ordered an alarm call for both days but of course didn't get the second one luckily I had already sussed out what kind of hotel it was and set my phone alarm. The standard of the room you get may depend on which side of the hotel you're in - I got to see the nicer side when searching for my room as the check-in clerk didn't tell me that I was across the road. Only good things- the concierge and the pool/gym staff were very helpful.,Warrington_UKVicky
UR5376696,2006-23-June,Myself and 2 colleagues stayed overnight. Not one smile from the reception staff as we checked in. The rooms (4th floor) were like a furnace. My room which was a single room had a tiny desk fan in it - no air conditioning - not good for a 4 star hotel. The room was tiny with literally a small path to walk on to get in and out of the bed. Thats maybe why they had removed the ironing board iron and hairdryer from the room. We asked for non-smoking rooms. All 3 rooms had ashtrays and a very stale smell of smoke. Despite leaving the desk fan on from the minute I walked into the room to the minute I left the room remained like a furnace. I didnt get any sleep at all!!,FWIT
UR5984216,2006-22-October,This was booked as part of a theatre/hotel deal for a delux twin but we still can't work out what we got for the extra. Our twin beds were side by side and as I was staying with a friend I asked for them to be moved apart while we were out for the day - that didn't happen. I had soap the first night but that disappeared for the second night. We had one shower gel between us one set of towels until we found the second one hidden in the wardrobe. Tea/coffee is hidden in the bottom drawer. Remote control didn't work and of course the concierge had to check it for about 5 minutes before he agreed to change it. Beds are comfortable air conditionining is difficult to use net curtains were filthy. 15 minute walk to the nearest tube. When I wanted a taxi I had to follow the concierge up the road and then back to the hotel entrance to chase a taxi . Continental breakfast was in the annex and was okay - croissants rolls ham and cheese selection of fruit and cereals and juices. My friends were given a smoking room which stank so much they insisted oon a change which reception were happy to arrange. Unfortunately by the time they got back to their original room to move their luggage the keycard had been disabled so that was another trip to reception. There are better hotels in London for the same price so avoid this one - there isn't anything good to say about it.,eve-boots
UR4990949,2006-20-April,My wife and I stayed here on easter night after having seen a show at the Barbican . I have to say that it was not good . Apparently we were upgraded to a superior room  although I find that hard to believe . The room was small  hot and musty. The bathroom was small  the shower didn't work properly  the hairdryer in the bathroom didn't work properly  the 'mini bar' was empty and had mildew inside . The TV didn't work properly either . It wasn't a pleasant experience . Breakfast the next morning was like a ruck  people everywhere  total chaos and the plates and cutlery was dirty too . The only good thing about the hotel is that I got a good deal and it's close to the Barbican centre (though there are closer ones) .,Soda's
UR4317691,2006-2-January,The hotel is in the middle of a large and nasty Islington council estate. This is not a good area of London to be in and as the tube station is ten minutes walk away you will need bravery and a sense of adventure just to reach the hotel! This goes particularly at night. Other guests followed a similar approach to us while risking a trip out of the hotel ie keep your head down and walk fast. If you reach the hotel safely you may wish you hadn't. It took 30 minutes to check in. The room had one towel for the two of us (after you dear I don't mind going second). At breakfast it takes so long for coffee to arrive you will get the impression they are off to collect the beans personally from South America. Reception staff aren't familiar with how to set up a room key card yet so ours locked us out of the room after one day when we were staying for two. Then there is the invisible room service which is supposed to be open til 2am. One night we tried to order some food at 9pm. We ring them but as usual they don't answer. We try reception but they don't answer either. We ring the hotel externally on mobile phone after about ten minutes they answer. We explain we are actually in the hotel but could only get to speak to someone by ringing externally and that we want to order some food. They tell us the chefs gone home early but we can have a sandwich! Gee thanks guys. On the plus side the swimming pool and health club were nice and our room was also good and nicely presented.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR5817386,2006-19-September,Nothing can justify the rack rate of 180 plus. Through an Internet agency I paid 60 for a single room on a Friday night (it would have been at least twice the price Monday-Thursday) and this was already a good price to pay for what you get. The words Barbican and City in the name are economical with the truth: you are in fact in Clerkenwell a sort of shady no mans land between the City and Islington far from the tube stations. If you do not have a good bus map you will in fact be dependent on scarce and expensive taxis. There is not enough staff at the Front Desk on Fridays : a large party of noisy low-class women was before me and I had to wait almost 20 minutes before checking in (I had arrived at 12:00 but was told that you could not check in before 14:00-14:30). Later in the evening there were continuous queues  even at 23:00 when I went to bed! My room (2307) was poorly designed: you could not really use the desk/table as the bedside table (in fact a fixed shelf) did not allow you to place the chair comfortably near the desk/table. The wooden panel which lined the bath had paint which flaked off and the shower/bath selection button was missing: basic maintenance is obviously neglected in that hotel. On the Saturday morning there were enormous queues for breakfast. No mushrooms were left the poor girl frying the eggs was overwhelmed and the toasting machine was not geared to so many people. A sure sign of a poorly-managed establishment: you had to wait for clean glasses before you could have your orange juice  and when they arrived they were hot straight from the dishwasher hardly suitable for chilled orange juice. I wonder who is prepared to pay 180 plus during the week  obviously businessmen on an expense account who do not care since it is the company that pays anyway? At 60 the value for money is already debatable! Not recommended unless it is your company that pays for you!,FCUNCTATOR
UR5360204,2006-19-June,Dear oh dear... Where to begin. 4 star definitely not. as per previous reviews really but this time with potentially fatal consequences. Upon arrival whilst checking in we are met with foreign staff who are trying to calm an existing (already checked in) customer down... a customer who is holding a syringe head that he has found in the swimming pool. Had it not been for the fact that we could not afford to change hotel we would have asked for a full refund and left it then and there. Needless to say my wife and I had immediately decided not to use the swimming pool facilites after seeing the man holding this potentially fatal item. I did not check to see whether the pool was closed after this incident but regardless this should not be happening in any establichemnt - especially a four star rated one ! The room was lousy window latch was broken - so no limit on how far it opens so beware if you have a young child as this could quite easily lead to a fall out of window from great height... As per other reviews room was far too hot (maybe this is why the catch was broken on the window ? ) and no air con - just a noisy rotating fan. you can hear rooms above below and either side with ease throughout the night. bathroom was disgusting. "power" shower head was clogged with limescale and in dire need of a good clean and the whole area around the bath was dirty with scale and mould. The overflow from the bath was thick with scum. Breakfast was the final straw... again foreign staff/not understaninding english led to lack of service - as when the machine that dilutes the apple juice ran out of apple syrup/mixture the staff did not understand - when all that was coming out was water... I am still waiting on some fruit juice now. All they had to do was change the box/bag inside the machine.,scottish_guy
UR4691412,2006-18-March,I had a small shabby room. No AC or vents- just a radiator and floor fan. No clock radio box of tissues or even a pen. There was a small room safe but it wasn't bolted down! Telephone and internet access ridiculously expensive. The neighborhood was just as shabby. The staff was pleasant sometimes competent but mostly clueless.,bartnj
UR5471073,2006-16-July,I have to agree with many others on this site about this truly rubbish hotel. I was part of a group reservation from the company I work for in London. Coming in on an early flight from S'pore found out they'd lost my reservation and refused my pre-arranged and paid for early check. It took two hours of on - off arguing and they only allowed me to check in after after I called my boss's PA and she called on behalf. No apology no nothing from hopelessly obnoxious staff who could hardly speak English and when I asked for the manager he ran off - truly unbelieveable. Room for the corporate rate of GBP125 was just rubbish- you can get better in Bayswater for GBP70 and its not located in godawful council estate. Breakfast was OK but again staff were just well hopeless. To be fair (although why should I be?) the gym was not bad. An extremely sorry excuse for a hotel almost makes me be embarrassed to be British when I consider the places I stay in KL Bangkok etc for far less money.,trixiebear
UR4978093,2006-16-April,I stayed in the main building and was greeted on arrival by a floor that should not have been open as it is undergoing major refurbishment which is long overdue. There was no wallpaper on any of the corridor walls and the sight when the lift doors opened was just shocking when compared with other floors. My room was well past it's sell by date but as I was staying on business and was aware that the hotel was full I made do for 3 days. A colleague stayed on a different floor and her room seemed ok so just be careful. The pool sauna and changing room facilities were excellent and the gym looked good but I didn't use this. Breakfast was fine and other food in the hotel ok particularly if you are staying on business and on your own but you're better off getting a taxi into central London where there are plenty of better places to choose from if not. I wouldn't want to walk atound the surrounding area at night - not a great part of London for a tourist to be situated in. I would not through choice stay here again and would not recommend to anyone.,Benisit
UR5804668,2006-15-September,Quite possibly the smallest room I've encountered other than in a Japaness capsule hotel! Dingy dirty and well past it's sell by date. Self service breakfast was poor and none of the staff seeemed to have a basic grasp of English. Requests for some butter were met with confused expressions! Leave plenty of time to check out and to get to wherever you're going as this is not particulalrly handy for anywhere!,msh37
UR5068859,2006-15-May,Possible one of the worst nights sleep I've had at a hotel. We were staying in an overpriced small tired looking hotel room on the 1st floor and throughout the night all we could hear was shouting from the council estates next door and vehicles driving past. The soundproofing in this hotel is pretty much none existant as was further proved when our neighbours checked in (probably quite quietly) at 2am. You could hear everything. To make matters worse the hotel room was incredibly hot and all they'd done to improve the situations was leave a desk fan in the room. There wasn't even an extractor fan in the bathroom. The automated wake-up call simply didn't happen ( I wasn't the only person complaining about this the next morning ) and the staff seemed completely uninterested in any complaints. They asked how my night was I listed my complaints none of which were noted and the receptionists only response was "Oh I see here you owe 20 for the room upgrade". That was it. No apology no promise to get anything looked into.. ridiculous. Terrible customer service terrible location 15 minutes walk to the nearest tube station and in dire need of some refurbishment. Oh but a nice breakfast though. Avoid.,UncleMike
UR4601549,2006-12-March,Stayed here for one night in a single standard cupboard room. Very basic but clean. If I hadn't been staying for work purposes I would have been very dissapointed. It took ages to check in and out!!,2teas
UR4967801,2006-12-April,As my normal choice of hotels was fully booked I was dismayed to find out I had been booked into the 'Barbican' Thistle especially as I understood it had been taken off of our approved hotel list due to many complaints. However I have to say I found the staff efficient friendly and helpful and the bed was extremely comfortable. These are the plus points. Because I had stayed here a few times previously I knew to ask for a room in the main building rather than the annexe which was granted. The price my company paid of 135 including breakfast was not cheap and there are better more convenient hotels in London. The breakfast was good usual full English and cereals but the continental choice left much to be desired. I didn't eat there in the evening but thought I would try the Chinese takeaway across the road which was fine and a sight cheaper! On the downside as mentioned in other reviews it is a long way from civilisation but I should dispel a few myths about the area. Having been born and brought up in London I know it's not the prettiest of areas. This doesn't mean it is particularly unsafe. Clerkenwell (to give the area it's proper name) and Finsbury were where gentry lived in Victorian times. Although the area has been neglected since then it is still likely to be the next up-and-coming area as it is an easy commute to the City and the West End. There aren't many good restaurants around but go a couple of blocks to Goswell Road or Old Street and it gets better. If you head for Hoxton Square near Old Street the first signs of regeneration are taking shape. The area has become very fashionable as it has a number of up-market bars clubs and restaurants and is popular with city workers. It is only a matter of time before it sneaks up on Clerkenwell and improves the place. Bear with it. It really isn't as bad as it looks. However don't head north towards King's Cross as that is rough. One final note it is becoming apparent that Thistle Hotels are letting their standards slip as I have stayed in a number of their hotels around the UK and they are all heading for 3 stars rather than 4. They've even sold the flagship hotel at the Tower.,dicanio10
UR5787327,2006-10-September,We were taking exams held at the Barbican Centre on 06/09/06. Therefore we were looking for a reasonable hotel nearby for the night of 05/09/06. Booking a deluxe room with breakfast at approx 186.00 seemed ok for our needs. How wrong we were!!!! We battled with air con for almost one hour - useless! Check in was almost unfriendly. Directions to our room quite vague. On opening the door I can only reinforce what others have previously said - a furnace!!! Also the basin was completely cracked in half bathroom stank!! Tumblers were dirty and curtains ripped. Overall room was dirty and when we asked " When was this room last cleaned?" we were told " someone will come to clean it ." We were also surprised to learn that  if two people occupy one room you will find additional towels dustily in the wardrobe (with built in light not working). We enquired whether someone could attend to the non existant air con and blown light bulbs while we went to dinner. We were assurred no problem. We had one drink in the bar before going out for dinner (only reason for going out was the appauling menu which sounded quite plasticised). Bar area was empty but pleasingly cool with its own air con! After returning from dinner we found our bathroom smelt just slightly betterbut nothing else had been attended to. Worn out we were in two minds whether do anything at all.The room was boilingand very little had been done --- I complained! We had alreday been told there were no other rooms avaliablebut suddenly the duty night manager Dinoh found us a suite close by with effective air con.We had to move ourselves and by this time (23.15) were thoroughly fed up with the whole thing and did not feel in the slighted bit rested. As for breakfast the following day cool and poor coffee juices insipidcooked items not even average by Travel Lodge standards. When we enquired whether an omlette or some mushrooms may be avaliable we were told "not now!" some 30 minutes before breakfast was due to close. We concluded that maybe unreasonable demands were being placed on already unmotivated staff but having travelled the world as a cabin crew member on holidays worldwide and innumerable corporate events - I can honestly say that this is the worst hotel(?) I have ever encountered. The only saving grace was our duty manager. A big " thank you" for your efforts in trying to make our stay betteryou were the ONLY member of staff that we felt had ANY regard for the companies customers and pride within their own work.(wish you well for the future). Word of warning ..... Think long and hard before bookingthere must be a better way!!!,memberashfordkent
UR5934057,2006-10-October,Sept inLondon just happens to be very humid.....so it makes sense that this hotel has no Air Conditioning in the rooms!!! Opening the windows is no good due to the noise outside. Crap beds...dirty linen and bathrooms. Expensive bar....crap restaurant. And expensive!!! Do not stay here .... go to the Holiday Inn around the corner,mrdenn1s
UR4160060,2005-4-December,I stayed here with my boyfriend for 1 night after booking via lastminute - we paid 65 B&B bargain we thought for a 4 star hotel in London - we should should had known that you get what you pay for! The hotel was a complete let down first of all when I went to check in while my partner attempted to park the car I was told that we couldnt have the double room we had booked but instead had to make do with a twin as they were fully booked. Unsatisfied with this my partner came back into the hotel spoke to a different person at the front desk and was asked if we would prefer a twin or double! So we got the double we booked in the first place on attempt number two. Meanwhile we were told that the hotel car park was fully booked and we would need to park at the NCP 10 minutes walk down the road and which was 5 more expensive per day - needless to say I recommend that if you have to stay here you should pre-book your parkeing if possible. We ended up parking on a street next to the hotel which was free from 1.30 pm on the sat to Monday morn - so we actually ended up saving money but we were lucky to find a space and I didnt feel too happy about leaving it on the street. This brings me onto the location its about 10 mins walk to the tube which is Ok but the area is not very desirable especially at night - so just like you would need to anywhere - take the necessary precautions. So...the room - its was too small dark and very dated. There were scuff marks and paint chipped from the walls. The bathroom smelt musty and was tiny - only just room to sit on the loo! The loo didnt seem to fully flush maybe due to an attempt from the hotel to save water. Breakfast was average but not much choice and the waiter service was very poor we had almost finished breakfast by the time we were asked if we would like tea/coffee! Needless to say it was a bed for the night and nothing more and I think the only reason I am so dissappointed is that I have stayed in much much nicer 3 star B&Bs with 4 stars my expectations are much higher - couldnt wait to get out of there.,Knieval
UR3397027,2005-21-April,First night of our stay climbed into bed to find wet sheets. Removing the sheets from the matress revealed a large urine stain. Manager wasn't too interested and we slept the first night on the sofa bed. The next night we went to check the bed only to find the matress had been dried ( not cleaned ) and replaced on the bed. Again the manager was not interested. We were moved to a different room ( where we were assured by the customer liason manger he had personally checked the bed ). On our arrival we asked for the bed to be stripped so we could check it. This revealed a blood stained matress protector. Wipe yer feet on the way out!!,A TripAdvisor Member
UR4126716,2005-19-November,The main problem with this hotel is not the property itself but rather the operations and staff. The worst things that happened to me were: - When I tried to call the front desk conceirge and room service the phone would just ring and ring (this frustratingly happened throughout the whole week that I stayed.) - My wake-up call was 45 minutes late two of the mornings. - The staff are surprisingly rude espcially the concerige who seemed irritated that they had to assist you! - It is in a very remote location which made eating and transportation very tedious. - Some days you have hot water other days there was none. - You can hear everything your neighbour is doing... Overall it is just a really poorly run hotel which will likely make your stay unpleasant. I would recommend not staying at this hotel no matter how low their prices go.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3574807,2005-18-June,Stayed here on business for 2 nights. Problem on check in as the receptionist whose English was not good neglected to tell me that my room was in the annex across the road so I spent around 10 minutes trying to find a non existent room. The annex was not very well appointed I had problems with the key card not working and it was fairly small even by London standards. Toiletries were nothing to write home about - Dove shower gel in a dispenser on the wall (who would want to take away that?). Dining was OK but parts of the breakfast were cold because of the way you have to queue up for eggs and watch as they are prepared - whilst everything on your plate is getting cold. Lots of the housekeeping staff could not speak English at all which made for interesting results. Area is very down at heel and you would not want to wander around at night.,YorkshireUKtraveller
