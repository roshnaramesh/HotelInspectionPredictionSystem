UR122749461,2012-8-January,My partner and I booked this 'hotel' for a week but only stayed for one night as it was awful! It then took over a month many complaints and intervention from authorities to get our money back! The room was up three flights of narrow stairs with no fire escape route the room was tiny dirty and smelly! We were expecting luxury but what we got was more like a youth hostel standard! The bathroom window was not made of the usual 'modesty/obscured' glass so my parter had to stand at the window next to the shower cubicle with a towel covering the window to ensure when I was showering no one in the building next to us could see! The place was awful and to top the lot when we complained the staff were the rudest I've ever encountered! They didn't care and their grasp of the English language seemed to diminish to get out of dealing with complaints! They refused to refund our money - close to 900! Fortunately as we took pictures of the god awful place and reported the breaches in health and safety we were able to initiate a formal dispute! This place should be shut down though they are fraudulent rude and disgusting! I feel sorry for anyone who ends up staying here! I'd recommend anyone with a complaint about this place to contact trading standards!,JayandKelly
UR124286059,2012-8-February,This hotel was by far the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. On arrival it was clear that the staff was unorganised and when asked how much the afternoon tea was there was an actual argument at the front desk among the staff. Once booked in the room we received had a damp smell (not unlike England though but would have thought a 4* hotel would not tollerate such an odour). There were various items in the hotel room that were not up to standard; there was a door knob missing the shower door did not close there was no milk for coffee. The following morning we headed to breakfast as the deal we bought included breakfast but on arrival we were addressed in front of the dining room by a member of staff telling us that we were not allowed breakfast. Once she checked on the front desk and they dug out the package we paid for it was confirmed. It was handled in a shocking manner! My husband was so humiliated that he went to speak to the manager only to be told that the manager was not on site but that the staff member (who has been especially helpful I might add as a positive) will call the manager and they will call us in the room in 15 minutes. After waiting more than 15 minutes we headed down and she was still on the phone. We arrived at the front desk where the lady sitting at the pc kept on telling us that "everything is ok you can go" and we responded by "we are waiting to speak to the lady on the phone" - this happened about 4 times - showing that they do not pay attention to the customer. My husband was then pulled aside once the staff member got off the phone and they offered to pay for our taxi which we turned down as we were there with our car. They then offered us 20 for compensation on the breakfast and told that they will follow up during the week needless to say we felt like we were bribed. It is Wednesday there was no follow up. I would never pay to go there again.,Melanie B
UR125691339,2012-6-March,Firstly the fact my family could not have dinner until 8pm limited what we could do in the evenings i.e. take in a show etc.! When I called the hotel with this is was constantly told we have afternoon tea for 200 on reflection if I had known this I would not have booked with you regardless of the cost. You should consider your hotel residents more carefully! When my sister went to have dinner they had to clear their own table before they could sit down with items remaining where they had cleared them on to the next table  had to ask for soup spoons  and then knifes to eat their food! Their package did contain champagne with dinner that they never received or offered! When I went to collect them at 8pm  I was shown into a nice lounge area while I waited asked if I would like a drinks and decided on a Gin & Tonic  only to be told we dont have that!! But was offered a glass of champagne  when this arrived @ 9.50 it was flat and warm!!! I left half of it and we left. On Sunday morning they decided to go for breakfast  which was too busy and was told it will be about 30/40 minutes before breakfast! So went to the Carlton Tower instead for b/fast.,Paul B
UR124188865,2012-6-February,We booked the Topham's hotel on a special occasion and were looking forward to it. The hotel looks lovely -boutique style rooms look nice staff friendly... But scratch that surface and you come across small rooms a bed so soft you sink in it sitting down a cold bathroom (made of old beautiful stones but not thought through for cold winters) a restaurant that although serving nice food feels more like a cantine and doesn't serve alcohol (nor does the bar?)... And the little things that make a difference... are non-existent: bathroom products are limited only one toilet paper roll tea but no milk etc... Being familiar with 3 to 5* hotels one can safely say that this one is far overrated way overpriced -prices of a 4*- for really what overall is just about a 2* despite its lovely looks. Thankfully we went on a special deal...,Allie L
UR125582393,2012-4-March,I went to the hotel with my boyfriend having bought a voucher via Groupon and were expecting a 4 star standard. However upon arrival we were asked to wait aside and had prompt the staff to be seen and allocated a room. The room itself would have had nice furnishings if it was not for the damage (cracked mirrors water damage on ceiling lights not working draw wouldn't close etc...). The room was also very compact- not much room to circulate and really stuffy- we had to get them to turn the heating down twice to make feel as least comfortable in the room. The 3 course meal which was included as part of our stay looked quite basic on the menu but was actually very tasty and worth the price we paid. Another complaint would be on the security deposit of 50 which they 'blocked' on my card upon arrival. I understand that this is common practise among hotels but there was a lack of information on what would happen with this when we left. I had to call them to reassure myself that the funds had been released upon departure. However this money is still blocked almost a week later at the point of writing this... Overall a poor experience- poor customer service- food was good- room was average. Maybe worth going but don't expect much from them.,Rachel T
UR123786930,2012-29-January,We used a groupon voucher to stay in london for my fainces birthday weekend. Staff were friendly on arrival and let us use the luggage room as we couldn't check in until 1300 which we were grateful for. When we did check in we were told we had been upgraded to deluxe double room 4 which we were excited about. The decoration was nice and room adequate. Only problem was that it had a real draft as was at the very front of hotel next to reception and extremely noisy. You can hear the front door going which appeared to be opening and shutting all through the night. The linen delivery van also turned up at 0700am and was extremely noisy parked right outside our room. It also unfortunately seemed to be where everyone went outside to smoke so there was always a strong cigarette smell coming in from outside. Not pleasant for non smokers. We chose to eat at 2100 in the restaurant and had pre booked meals 2 days before so they knew our starters  mains and deserts way in advance. Despite this we arrived at 2050 and were seated and given the champagne... They unfortunately could only offer tea or coffee or water to drink and had no bar menu. We received our starters 40 minutes after our arrival which was actually bruschetta and didnt require much cooking so we failed to see how they could have taken this long. Lasagne was standard and did not come with any vegetables or salad which you would normally expect. There were couples that arrived after us that we're on desert as our starters came out. In summary we were a bit disappointed with our stay and have read some very positive reviews from some on here so maybe a different room would have made for a different stay experience for us.,JUDE069
UR125382245,2012-29-February,Difficult review this one as we booked this hotel up hurriedly on the way to London staying that night via late rooms then read the reviews. Oh dear we thought and started to panic rang late rooms back up to say hopefully we could cancel due to the negative reviews they have had. Lateroom's got straight onto the case but called back five minutes later to ask that the manager was not in until tomorrow so we MAY end up paying even if we didn't stay. So I blamed the poor old husband and he took the ear bashing. We went and had a great day out then decided to check in to see what we had let ourselves in for. Firstly we arrived to see a notice on the front door to check in at Tophams Hotel no 28 instead of No 50 which annoyed me as we had walked back and lets face was this place was never going to stand a chance especially as when we walked into Tophams what a lovely bright clean and shiny reception so we negatively checked in for Belgravia Mews then to be told that Tophams was not fully booked so they had upgraded us to for the same price I honestly saw my husband's shoulders lift about a foot with relief so went happily to our room No 4 which was in the basement opened the door and got a really pleasant surprise considering what we thought we would be getting!! then on closer inspection...... there was a really bad odour of damp/drains in the room the shower lights were not working a HUGH bath but the shower attachment would only work with the bath taps on sealing and grouting missing in the bathroom chips on the woodwork and the carpet could have done with a good clean the mattress was so soft you sunk in the middle and then the air conditioning seemed to have a mind of its own. However remember we got this at a bargain price of 62.16 including breakfast so should we be complaining probably not! The next morning we remember the clonking noise as people walked through the reception area above but we had things to do so didnt want a lay in (good job really). We also then noticed no milk or English tea in the hospitality tray so ventured to breakfast. English breakfast luckily for us was included in the price although again I think this was because we had been upgraded as I heard someone enquire if they could have a cooked breakfast. The waitress obviously says yes but it was 19.95 thank goodness she declined. The breakfast was buffet style and when I got there they had run out of eggs and bacon the rest was all being kept warm under not very efficient chaffing tins. The Danish pastries were excellent though so probably best to stick to continental breakfast. Summary: We did well in the end for 62.16 in the middle of London and were grateful for the upgrade despite the maintenance issues. The reason why I am publishing this on both hotels is to warn others not to pay TOO much for the Tophams hotel as it does have its downfalls and perhaps try and get an upgrade if you are staying at Belgravia Mews which we could not fault as we did not stay there. All staff were polite but when we pointed out the smell issue not much notice was taken so overall ok but wouldnt pay over the top for this hotel.,rakeevil
UR123744594,2012-28-January,Booked and pre-paid through lastminute.com top secret deal. Our attempted stay was on 10 November. On arrival at 10pm decor looked ok. Very unwelcoming reception staff squabbling amongst themselves who took a while to notice we were waiting to check-in. There was then a disagreement about which room we had been allocated....more strained conversation between check-in staff. Our voucher was not accepted due to the hotel not processing the payment from last minute.com. Having contacted our credit card provider we confirmed our payment had been processed we had our hotel voucher and had expected that the hotel would resolve the issue.....however we were advised we would not be allowed to stay at the hotel without paying for a night's stay- 250. Having already paid approx 570 through lastminute.com and in possession of our voucher and booking confirmation we refused to provide them with any further payment or swipe of our card. Long-story short we spent almost 2 hours in reception arguing with numerous check-in staff and the general manager (over the phone). The general manager was particularly rude was not prepared to speak to me in the first instance and when he did he interrupted me constantly and actually hung up the phone on me. The check-in staff were regularly calling him throughout the 2 hour ordeal for advice; they are not empowered and were visibly scared to agree anything with us without speaking to him first. Finally we decided we would not stay at the hotel (despite already having paid in full for 3 nights to last minute.com and having no-where else booked in London). Even when we advised the staff we were leaving and that we wanted a refund they would not even do this. We found another hotel and got a walk-in rate - at this point it was after midnight. The next day I called lastminute.com and told them what had happened. Lastminutecom advised that Tophams should have contacted Lastminute.com using the 24 hour hotel support service they provide and the matter could have been resolved immediately allowing us to check-in straight away. Lastminute.com provided excellent service and arranged an immediate refund. Tophams staff did try to call lastminute.com when we first arrived but they used the standard customer service number that shuts at 8pm they told us they had no out of hours number that they could use. Despite asking the general manager to call me when he was back in the hotel the next day I received no phone call and no apology; this is despite Tophams being completely in the wrong. The staff simply did not know how to deal with a situation that could have been resolved so easily via a quick call to lastminute.com out of hours service. Our experience at Topham's was absolutely horrible we have recommended that lastminute.com take Tophams off their list of hotels offered and we would certainly advise other potential guests not to take the risk of staying here; clearly it can be hit or miss but when it is bad it is truly horrendous.,C M

UR125183630,2012-25-February,First impressions on going into the hotel are very good. Reception staff were very friendly and helpful. The actual hotel accomodation was quite nice. Rooms furnished tastefully although ours was a little cramped and very hot. So far so good. We had our meal booked for 7.30pm (having preordered from a limited menu on a "romantic 3 course meal with champagne" deal with Groupon). We went to the bar at 7pm which was not staffed so we had to ask in reception for drinks. We were brought our complimentary glass of champagne. After making our way to our table we asked for wine with our meal. Nope don't have any wine. WHAT???!!!! have you ever ever ever been to a restaurant in a four star hotel in London that doesn't serve wine?. Ridiculous - bordering on the Faulty Towers. From here it went swiftly downhill. The "carrot soup" was blended carrots heated in the microwave and was the consistency of baby food. The waitress explained that it was "creamed" and this is how they make it italian style. Never had soup like that in my life. Gloup more like. Bruschetta was french stick with a couple of mushroom smoked salmon very basic very poor very disappointing. Don't get me started on the mains they appeared within seconds of the starter being removed. Lasagne was Findus like microwaved tosh with a few dry cucumber slices as garnish. No option to order sides no fresh veg no chips nothing. Chicken salad plonked on rocket with some small cubed potatoes and cherry tomatoes. No dressing. Dry tasteless non descript. Had better food in a Harvester. In fact later in the evening we went to Victoria station and got an Upper Crust cheese and tomatoe roll that was infinitely better that what we'd eaten at the hotel. Oh and because there wasn't any wine (still can't quite believe it) my husband asked for a bottled beer with his meal that was served warm and in a warm glass. Classy. NOT GOT A CLUE. Fits of giggles ensued it was that bad. On checking out we explained how disappointing the meal was and was told that they would tell the "management". The "management" needs a few lessons in how a restaurant should be run. This is a nice hotel on the surface but that's as far as it goes scratch underneath and it's not good. They are cashing in on their location and no way provide the service in the restaurant that you would expect from a four star establishment.,clare g
UR123540988,2012-24-January,I booked a room at Tophams for work through a 3rd party website. The hotel is convenient to Victoria Station offers free wireless internet and has charming decor. I was put in a basement room with a cavernous and freezing cold bathroom with a broken shower door. The shower head on the additional bathtub did not work making my first morning's bathing ritual a challenge and not the way one wants to start a work week when traveling for business. The second day my shower door was still not repaired but I decided to use it nonetheless. The smoke detector installed right next to the shower stall went off from the shower steam waking up all of the hotel guests at 7am. I was interrupted twice mid-shower and told that I need to shower with the fire door (out to the main street) open to let out the steam! I insisted upon a new room. To the hotel's credit they put me in a very nice room after the smoke detector incident but too little too late. I travel to London frequently for business and will strike Tophams from my list.,Jennifer-Rus
UR125119863,2012-24-February,My husband and I were given a nights stay and dinner for his birthday from groupon. The value stated on the voucher was 264.00 which is ridiculous!!! The bedroom was tiny hot and not entirely finished. The bathroom had an unfinished window and damp on the ceiling. For the meal we were offered a choice of three main meals only one of them being vegetarian (unlucky for me). Our starters were brushcettas which were dry baguette with tinned mushrooms soft cheese and salmon garnished with dry cucumber. Main meals had been microwaved and again garnished with dry cucumber. Dessert was tinned fruit salad with was awful. With the voucher we were also promised a glass of champagne when it arrived we asked for an additional bottle and it was cava!!! On top of that a dreadful nights sleep in the sweaty little bedroom with the noisy lift next door people stomping and slamming doors I will categorically never stay in this hotel again. The staff were indifferent and rude with the exception of our waitress who was a delight :-) Rubbish value for money this should be a four stay hotel.,Ellehaze
UR123492035,2012-23-January,We pre booked a week ahead for a table for 8 including four young children. We got to the hotel and were shown to the lobby if you could call it that I know the Tophams hotel is a boutique hotel but it was a small waiting area that hardly seated the 8 of us and there were lots of people milling about with luggage and no space for anyone. We were shown to out table the dining room looked like a canteen and indeed we could see remnants of breakfast still on the heated serving area. We were offered juices instead of our champagne juices were terrible quality concentrate tea was mediocre with no "real" tea or sugar...no strainers sugar cubes etc...all packeted goods and generally what you would get in a cafe. Our food took over an hour to arrive even though we had warned of young children at the time of booking the room was busy and we definitely felt it...the tables were packed in and with no cloakroom for coats etc...Made the room even more claustrophobic. After asking twice how long our food would be and a good 45 minutes later we were given half of our food again poor quality sandwiches. The pastries and scones were ok and served warm. By the time the rest of the rest of the food arrived a good 30 minutes later we had just had enough and wanted to leave. There was a four person queue for the one available guest toilet we were then shown to a second toilet on the second floor....again not what I expected one toilet for a dining room full of guests?? All in all a very disappointing experience and with none of the attention and ambiance that is usual at an afternoon tea treat. Very disappointed especially after attending similar experiences in the same area/similar hotels and leaving feeling like we have had a treat. Would avoid and now know to check the reviews before I book.,aj1
UR125036903,2012-22-February,Was really looking forward to our tea day Christmas present. Despite the fact we had pre booked and had an email reservation the assistant demanded we get a bar code to be scanned. As it was a present we had to ring our friend at work get her to go home and get her log in details to the groupon ap download the ap to our phones which we had to go outside for since there was no Internet we were panicking because our phone battery was low and once we had sight of this barcode they were looking for we were told their scanner wasn't receiving it. After 50 mins of this fiasco they finally said our code worked. We were in a small conservatory we had to keep moving our chairs to let people pass. Very squashed in. We had a few sandwiches one sandwich sliced up into fingers each some small sweets but no doubles so had to share each one one scone each and one cup of tea. One pot made one and a half cups. No offer to refill or bring more sandwiches. Have been to many other London tea experiences and this one is not recommended. We enjoyed our day because we managed to laugh about it. I heard other people asking 'is that all'. Try grosvenor park lane instead same price if you get an offer with a spacious room pianist refills and excellent customer service!,Beatravels2
UR123395944,2012-21-January,We bought a Groupon voucher and stayed at this hotel from 14-15 January. I'm sorry but the food was appalling and clearly microwaved despite what some of the other reviews say on this site. We waited an hour and a half for our mains and I had a plate of beef lasagne that was clearly out of a packet. The staff were as helpful as they could be but everyone in the restaurant was furious. One couple left before their meals and decided to go home as they were so appalled. The rooms are ok but the finish on the work that has been done was poor. Cracking tiles in the bathrooms and missing grout bed was comfortable and it's in a quiet area but I really think the food was terrible.,Nicky H
UR124912041,2012-20-February,Where do i start - My daughter gave My wife and i a present of a 'Champagne afternoon Tea for 2 via Groupon and the wife decided that it would be good for her sister and partner to join us so we booked another thru Groupon and booked for the Sunday the 19th Feb so before we went looked at some of the reviews which did'nt do it any justice and said it can't be all that bad so we went with an open mind - The Reception area is pretty small and the toilets or should i say toilet serving the whole of the ground floor is unisex therefore always in use. We was shown to our table on time and received our room temperature Champagne about 10 minutes later - Plates and cutlery missing on table Tea and coffee came along 20 minutes after the Champagne and the Finger sandwiches and cakes with scones showed their heads 45 minutes after we arrived - The filling in the sandwiches was very thin to say the lease the cakes were the smallest and the scones were stale. Both of my daughters have been to afternoon tea before at other hotels and they sounded nice but this one was not the best and would not recommed it,Barry S
UR123309085,2012-19-January,Reception - appalling. The receptionist first tried to convince me that I was actually booked into their sister hotel despite having a copy of faxed booking and confirmation in front of her. Somebody senior intervened and said she'd got it wrong and that they would give me "one of their nicest rooms" because of the confusion. This "nicest room" was in the attic and accessed by a corridor so narrow that I could not walk along it with my small overnight bag by my side! (I am of slim build). (I thought there were building / fire regs covering such things). The room itself was the smallest hotel room I have been in in a very long time. Fortunately I was staying alone although this was a double room. The wall mounted flat screen TV did not work so there was a second TV taking up most of the very small side-table. The toilet seat was loose. The tea / coffee facilities had coffee but only a single Breakfast Tea bag. All I can say is that at least the room was clean. I'm afraid I would be nervous of staying here again in case I was given one of their not-so-nice rooms. On a positive note the staff who served me at breakfast were extremely friendly and efficient and the restaurant was bright and clean. I cannot for the life of me understand why this hotel is classified 4 star. On this trip I just needed somewhere to sleep after an evening engagement leaving first thing in the morning so it was tolerable. If I was on a more extended stay and expecting to spend any time in the room or take my wife then I could not consider Tophams.,Rickx
UR124528178,2012-13-February,I was in the reception at this hotel when the reviewer below voiced their disappointment to the receptionist and agree totally with the comment that they were ignored. The hotel is badly managed badly maintained and the staff are atrocious. So where to start. The room my children stayed in had water stains on the ceiling damp carpet near the fridge we are not sure if this was as a result of a leaking bathroom or fridge. We requested an extra bad for a night and I eventually had to put it outside the room as it wasn't removed a day after it was used....we then had to move the bed from in front of the bedroom door for 2 days as that is where it stayed and the children couldn't get in or out of the bedroom without moving the bed. On about day 3 of a very long week stay my daughter finally took the toilet holder that had fallen off the wall down to reception and asked that it be reattached to the wall and two days later had to request again that it be fixed. Adding to the trials of this room was an airconditioner that had a mind of its own and either created arctic conditions during the night or was like living under a flight path. (we did notice in both our rooms that the airconditioners changed temperature on their own or turned on and off at will). The final straw came when the electricity tripped in the room and the hotel then became a family joke 'Fawlty Towers' would have been luxurious in comparison. So to room 2.........we asked for another room with 2 single beds and received a room with a queen and a fold out cotbed. The cot bed collapsed one evening and it took about an hour to get it back up correctly. The permanent bed was lumpy and I could almost feel the springs in it at night. One of the things that amazed me the most was the fact that there were no mattress protectors and 3 small pillows that had seen better days. And then there was the bathroom......bathgel and shampoo and small amounts of soap are hardly 4 star not even tissues on offer. There is no towel rack near the shower (except the broken one behind the door) and so the trek from shower to grab a dry towel each day was a pain. The reason we couldn't leave towels near the shower was that the shower leaked and the floor became very dangerous after the shower was used. The shower also flooded and on the second day I decided to try and find out why....I removed the drain cover and found a few years worth of hair clogging the drain...........I mentioned this to reception and yes the shower was cleaned up but seriously absolutely no apology just the offer of coffee. And now on to reception.......so many staff no one had any idea what they were doing and they were all obviously stressed as it was a bit like watching chickens with their heads cut off. I hate complaining and as nothing we asked to have repaired while we were there was done |I thought this was a perfect venue to voice a few complaints. Oh and one more thing that I found incredulous...if one more staff member pushs rudly past me without apology (or for that matter allowing me the guest to go first) I am unsure what I will say. Such bad manners. Tophams pick up your game...stop blaming housekeeping and have a serious look at why people are writing negative reviews Oh and why didn't we move hotels? because the place was so ideally placed for all London had to offer and it was prepaid so easier to just use it as a place to sleep,dd43
UR122350523,2012-1-January,Service on arrival was poor to say the least the staff didn't know a thing. Our room wasn't ready so we were asked to wait in the bar but we couldn't have a drink. Decide to go out and come back an hour later initially we were told they would put us in one of the best rooms they had then told 'actually that wasn't ready yet'. So room 201 it was tiny you could barley move we had no space to put our luggage no milk no price cards and no hotel info. However it was NYE so we shrugged it off and went out when we came back they wouldn't serve room service nor did the staff know where we could get something to eat from. We went to bed hungry. Room 201 has internal doors with 202 meaning you could hear literally everything! I didn't get any sleep as I listen to room 202 fart and snore amongst other things. There was also a draught in the room so when windy I could hear that howling too. I'm not one to complain or write a review but as I'm sat on the train home I felt I should share my thoughts. We paid a silly amount of money for this box room. I'd rather have a travel lodge at a fraction of the cost. Location was superb minutes away from Buckingham palace. Also the 50 pre authorisation fee is a bit annoying it takes up to 2 days to be refunded!,Dandyquindell
UR123973724,2012-1-February,To start with the good this hotel is very conveniently located for Victoria station. That is about all in its favour. Having checked in I took my luggage up to the room and had barely set foot in the room before the fire alarm was ringing. This was a minor inconvenience as I was planning to head straight back out anyway. When it happened again at seven o'clock the following morning I was less amused especially when informed by a member of staff that it had been set off by someone having a shower. The room was quite poky with no space to stand a standard sized suitcase that didn't prevent walking round the room. There was space on top of the chest of drawers but this then impeded the view of the television. I don't think the television had been retuned any time soon either so half of the channels were not actually viewable. The filter in the kettle looked truly vile and there was some nasty damp coming through the paint around one of the light switches. The furniture in the room might at a distance have appeared vaguely elegant at close range it would probably be rejected by Jordan as tacky. The desk had a nasty wobble as well. Finally the bathroom. While acceptably appointed it was very cramped. I was unable to sit on the toilet without catching my leg rather painfully on the hot towel rail. While I am a little over average height I am not a giant. The room smelled a bit funny as well.,186402Pete
UR96061607,2011-9-February,I've booked a room at your hotel tonight and arrived at 1950. I had to make an important call at 2000. Reception informed me that I'd been booked into your sister hotel in Belgravia - The Knightsbridge Green Hotel. I've just been checked in here into a room. The hotel is shabby the room is awful and I've missed my call. I am extremely disappointed and will formalise my complaint. I am not used to this and I am very surprised you appear to feel that you might get away with treating guests like this.,Fedupnblue
UR107412467,2011-8-May,Sadly booked this hotel through lastminute.com so could not cancel the reservation. I stayed in room 109 for 2 days- here is a list of my complaints. 1) arrived at hotel about 4pm and was told by reception that they had not made up my bed as they linen had not arrived from the laundromat 2) insisted on taking a GBP 50 deposit per night but have actually put a charge through- and still waiting for the refund 4 days later 3) the hotel description says it's recently refurbished but rooms are tatty and grubby stains on carpets broken tiles in bathroom caulking around tiles falling out and very poorly installed 4) kettle in room was so crusted with lime scale 5) flatscreen tv on wall was on visible from the corner as it could not be turned to face the bed 6) mattress on bed very lumpy 7) i was in reception when a man arrived to check-in and the hotel had purposely overbooked. the receptionist said that the computer had crashed and that's why there was such confusion. what a lie. they overbook on purpose and then send the extra guests to another hotel down the road. I could carry on this list the receptionists are so used to receiving complaints that they have all the excuses and I am sure that nothing is done about any complaints. Do not stay in this hotel ever........it's dreadful.,lexiseachef
UR92200809,2011-8-January,This hotel is no more a 4 star hotel than a bench in Hyde Park! It seems that the original hotel where reception is may be ok but I was brought down the street to a different building (what I deduce was previously the Harcourt Hotel). The only light was a lamp the shower was tiny the window wouldn't remain open there was no housekeeping done I had to go up to reception twice to get soap the tea cup was dirty there was (and the following all appear on their site as being included) no safe no air conditioning no minibar no climate control no safe box  no fridge no hairdryer it had a work desk with lamp (but no chair) no iron no ironing board no CD/DVD player no radio no complimentary mineral water no bathrobe and there was no housekeeping done at all. I echo most of the reviews here especially "Good hotel for mildew enthusiasts". If you have booked this hotel try to ensure you get a room in the 'actual' hotel it may not be much better but it sure can't be any worse!,cos1234
UR121525246,2011-8-December,Having stayed at Tophams many times under previous management I was excited to try it again when looking for a last minute hotel in London after its complete refurbishment under new owners. The pictures on the website looked lovely but when I arrived quite late but I had warned them I was shunted down the road to an annexe. There was just a flimsily locked door with no night staff one reason I always stayed there was because it was small and friendly and there was always someone on the door so as a lone female traveller I always felt safe. The shower room had a large uncurtained window on to a road with houses opposite. The light above the sink which had no plug was broken and the toilet cistern was adrift from the wall. In the morning there was no water hot or cold. In the room both twin beds were broken the TV remote did not work and the carpet was badly stained. The decor was ghastly and there was no furniture apart from the beds. I packed my bag in the morning and refused to go back. My compensation was being allowed full rather than continental breakfast for which the charge is normally 19. Cooked breakfast consisted of 2 chaffing dishes with a candle under them with nasty prepared scrambled egg etc already cold by 7.30am. The second night I was in the main hotel which was a great deal better hot water curtains decent furniture although the rooms are a bit soulless compared with the cosiness I remember when they were about a quarter of the price. Noise from the room above was noticeable. Good location helpful young girls in reception and at breakfast but really not worth the money and avoid at all costs being in the annexe!,skirling
UR119036146,2011-7-October,I share the view of others this is a really poor hotel. Checked-in and taken down the street to the 'other' building. Basically this looks like an old B&B poor quality dark no lift and nothing like the description of the hotel as a newly refurbished 4* (you wouldnt pay more that 50 to stay in this sort of room/building). Refused room and given one in the main building. Had booked a twin they provided a small room queen bed and offered to play a camp bed in the room. Was late for a concert so just agreed. Camp bed was old smelly no sheet provided for the blanket had to call for one when we returned. Room would have been acceptable for 1 person certainly not 2 and definitely not a camp bed. Whilst everything looked newish you can see that it was done on the cheap and there was a lot of wear already. AC was useless shower was outside of the bathroom (odd) and the main door rattled each time someone on the same floor opened/closed their door. Hardly managed any sleep mix of the camp bed (whilst collapsed in the middle of the night and the noise from the corridor). Paid 125 room only totally overpriced please avoid even a Travelodge would be better and cheaper!,MC_W408
UR120297441,2011-7-November,I'm staying in London on business and I found this hotel on laterooms.com. The pictures look nice and seemed good value for money. On arrival after performing all the normal checkin formalities they told me they were overbooked. A familiar theme I have found after reading a few reviews on here. They offered me a room in the mews hotel next door. It's dingy dark and horrid. After going back and complaining that I would like some money back for having a lesser room I was told 'what do you want me to do about it?'. Her attitude just stank. Eventually I got 15% back off the price I paid. If I had the energy I would have complained some more. It will do for one night but only just. It's a shame this hotel didn't meet my expectations. Its close to where I'm working and would have been a conveinent choice for the next few months I'm here.,Andyt4x4
UR99232893,2011-7-March,I had the worst hotel experience of my life with this booking. When we went to check into Tophams hotel at midnight (our flight was late) the room we booked was unavailable. The lady offered us a room without a bathroom...we refused. She then told us that we could have a room 10 doors down in a "Sister Hotel". We asked to speak to a manager but she refused. After 30 minutes I agreed to look at the rooms she was offering. She said the room in that hotel without a bathroom had a bathroom right beside it that we could use...there was a bathroom down a stairs at the end of a corridor I totally found this unacceptable. We saw the other room in the sister hotel it was awful. It was more like a student flat and bared no resemblance to a 4 star hotel. We were very upset I had a business meeting the next morning was totally wrecked tired and just wanted to get a place to sleep. We demanded to speak to the manager and he eventually was called 1am and he agreed to give us a 35 refund (which never happened) if we accepted the room in the sister hotel. At this stage we were too exhausted to argue so we accepted. They also offered us a breakfast. So we went to the room and I had no idea what awful conditions were ahead of us: The phone was not working so we could not contact reception there was no top sheet on the bed the pillows were old and not nice *I can't say more than that* It was FREEZING and we could not work the storage heater in the room it was broken There was no hot water The shower door was broken There was a recessed light in the shower unit and it was loose and coming downcompletely dangerous. There was no milk to even make tea I had to get dressed at 8 walk down to reception in the rain and ask where I could get a shower and they told me I could use one in that hotel I refused to carry my toiletries on the street in my dressing gown so they gave me a key to a room 3 floors up. I then started to cry...I have never had such a negative experience...it was upsetting beyond words and I had a very important business meeting that day and felt completely unprepared and upset.I never closed my eyes that night had no sleep as it was so cold and just rotten. I booked this on Secret Hotels...beware people!,charmedforsure
UR115112636,2011-7-July,I stayed overnight 5th July. I had booked using expedia 'top secret' hotels but still wasn't cheap. when i arrived i was told that the computers had crashed and they were overbooked and all they could offer me was a room without a bathroom. i have subsequently read the previous trip advisor reviews and discovered that this has happened frequently in the past weeks and months!! i was lead to a room that had a double mattress with single headboard and a single pillow. there were cracks on the walls very little space around the bed (but i generally expect that in London!) no iron no hairdryer and no extra pillows/blankets. i tried to phone down and the phone didn't work -i could hear them but they could not hear me. the TV had variable reception on cable channels. the bathroom i was to use was down the corridor and down a flight of stairs. As i was not expecting to go out to a bathroom I asked if they could provide a bathrobe but was told that was not available. I was assured that I was the sole user of this bathroom. However during the night i discovered that it was being used by someone else and in the morning there were dirty towels on the floor following someoneelses shower! i was incredibly disappointed with this room with the hotel staff and with expedia. i do not recommend you stay here or book with expedia 'top secret' hotels,freq_flyer_UK
UR95808807,2011-7-February,You only have to look at the Trip advisor feedback to know that I cant tell you anything new. This place is absolutely appalling. Looks smart enough but the staff are utterly clueless and unwilling to provide even the most basic level of service. I booked through Lastminute and they had given away my room presumably to get more money by the time I arrived (just before the time I stated I would arrive). Made no attempt to resolve the problem and stuck me in an awful fleapit B&B for the night. I returned the following night. Not bad looking room though small and noisy but the service has got to be experienced to be believed. Dont do it and definitely dont use Lastminute to book it - they wont honour your booking if it doesnt suit them and neither they nor Lastminute are that bothered about refunding nights you didnt get.,alex_horsley
UR111857591,2011-6-June,Small rooms very poor room service no replenishment of toiletries. Asked for 50 on credit card. Did so reluctantly as refused to allow check in without doing so. Breakfast didnt resemble what was on the menu. No cheeses cold meats yoghurts fresh bread as advertised. We booked bed & breakfast which is what we paid for but were told it was continental only on arrival. We didnt complain but asked to upgrade to the full english which was 3 more than the continental at 14.95. We were told that we would have to pay the full amount as our continenatal breakfast was complimentary. Not according to our booking form which stated we paid for the breakfast. We didnt take them up on their less than kind offer. The dining area was stifling hot. The kitchen must have been no more than 3sm in size. People were asking for items on the menu only to be told they didnt have them. This is at best a 2 star due to its lack of facilities. No bar area even. All staff seem eastern european & though one was ok the rest were surly. Dining staff were disorganised which is surprising given the small number of guests they had to serve at any one time. I get a feeling there are some unscrupulous profiteers behind this business who appear to be faceless & let these foreign workers face the brunt of criticism & are very poorly equipped to deliver. Dont risk this hotel unless your expectations are low. The hotel is in a very good location for tube & buses from Victoria,shonker53
UR121444303,2011-6-December,Two of us stayed here for 4 uncomfortable nights. Located just a couple of blocks from Victoria Station this hotel was easy to walk to and easy to find. Upon entering the small lobby there were 5 women working the single check in desk and the atmosphere felt very busy. We were quickly helped and checking in was a snap. We were informed that they had goofed and didnt have a room with two beds that we had paid for (there were two of us staying in the room) but not to worry they had fixed the problem and put a second bed in our small room. What a joke. The bed they included in our room made the room so crowded you could hardly walk to the bathroom without moving things. The new bed turned out to be a small metal cot frame with a 2-inch thick mattress. The center bar to the cot frame was broken/bent in such a way that it stuck up into your back and made it absolutely impossible to put your full weight onto the mattress and fall asleep. In the end the frame was removed and one of us ended up sleeping on the floor. The hotel apologized but had no other way to help us and expected us to be happy about that and stop complaining. So in the end we had to choose between staying or going someplace else and loosing the money for the unused nights. We decided to stay rather than spend double for the rest of our trip. On a side note most nights I noticed that they had overbooked and had to turn guests away to a cheaper hotel for the same price. They werent that friendly to the guests they overbooked and acted like they had done nothing wrong and that the guest should simply accept their accident (or standard practice) and smile. Had we been given the correct room I would have rated this location higher as the main bed was comfortable and the room looked nice but their mistakes and lack of responsibility or caring has led me to believe they are not there to give a guest a pleasant stay only make a quick buck. I would stay elsewhere unless everything else is sold out.,strongma
UR103094954,2011-6-April,The only positive is that it's close to Victoria tube station. The room was hilarious. Firstly I was told to press the down button on the elevator so my room was technically a basement room. It was supposed to be an upgrade! The paint in the ceiling was coming off. This was especially noted in the bathroom which was technically placed under the pavement outside. The paint was coming off and would land in the sink. The paint is also coming off in the shower cubicle. My view outside is like a prison cell with bars that I can see and feet walking on the pavement. Very difficult to call this 4 star. It promises Molton Brown in bathroom on website and you get a plethora of weird choices - unnamed brands and Neutrogena and it also says it has a restaurant but technically it doesn't serve dinner as you have to order food from outside so it's really a breakfast room. Not good. I have tried to email for a refund and had no reply at all. Last minute could not do a thing for me.,Saifulka
UR107029249,2011-5-May,My father-in-law and several colleagues were booked here while on a trip to the UK. We took the opportunity to meet them while they were here. Under such circumstances you feel some responsibility given it is a rare visit for them to my home country. We hung around while they checked into Tophams and were hugely embarrassed to see what Tophams expected their guests to put up with. For some inexplicable reason the rooms booked in Tophams itself had been given to other guests and instead we were led down to a different building down the road. The Harcourt (as it appears to have previously been known) is atrocious. It's a cramped dingy poorly maintained building with inadequate access (no porters offering to assist with carrying luggage either to the building or up the multiple steep flights of stairs). The rooms and en-suites were small and the phone in the room didn't work. It certainly isn't four-star standard as Tophams is supposed to be (very misleading booking a four star hotel and ending up there). Quite what Tophams think they're doing putting people up in this wholly inadequate building I don't know - they certainly don't deserve repeat business from it. The rude slow unhelpful staff and their insistence on having a 300 card authorisation rounded off their lamentable introduction to London hospitality.,Cakewalker
UR116309843,2011-5-August,I have been for a fair amount of afternoon teas and this one was by far the worst. My friend and I eventually managed to get through on the phone number given and booked for a Monday afternoon. When we got there the receptionist showed us to an empty dining room where a waitress looked surprised at having customers and told us we could sit anywhere. It was a blazing hot day and the dining room had a glass ceiling so the place felt like a greenhouse. We were given a tea menu which had a poor selection of Twinings tea bags and I then had to wait 15 minutes while one of the receptionists ran to the shop to buy a box of the tea I'd asked for (although the waitress didn't actually bother to tell me this until I asked why it was taking so long). We still hadn't received any food by this time and when we asked about this we were told the person who does afternoon tea doesn't actually work at the hotel and was running late. She arrived 25 minutes after our booking time and offered us a glass of sparkling wine before the food. After 10 minutes I had to find a waitress and remind her of this after which we received glasses of cheap non-sparkling chardonnay in sparkling wine glasses. The food then arrived on a cake stand that hadn't been screwed together properly. The sandwiches were below average the portions of clotted cream were ridiculous so we had to ask for more. The cakes consisted of half a cream doughnut a meringue a miniature cupcake and a small piece of chocolate cake that I recognized as being from Tesco. We left most of the food and had to use the nasty wine to wash away the taste as even this wasn't as bad as the cakes. In addition there was one toilet for guests which had a large bag of rubbish outside and some cleaning products so I couldn't get to it and had to try again later. The service and standard of food was appalling. The person who runs the afternon teas has no idea what one should actually be like and is providing an extremely poor service a prices comparable to the Park Lane hotel (which is excellent). The quality of the afternoon tea at Topham's isn't even worth 10 per person let alone 32. Stay well away.,MissCornish
UR110789425,2011-31-May,We didn't stay at this hotel but went for afternoon tea on a Groupon deal and if this experience was a guide then we would recommend you avoid this place. To begin with we felt rather ignored and then the afternoon tea arrived! If this was the best that a 4* hotel can muster then there is no hope! Sandwiches were of the processed ham and cheese slice variety. Scones were very good but cakes were identical to a well known supermarket "value range". I know we were taking advantage of a special deal but this was very very poor for a hotel of this class. Be warned!,starryeyed_traveller
UR122323874,2011-31-December,While there is certainly nothing wrong with the location of the hotel or the cleanliness/niceness of the rooms the service I received from the staff was not particularly good and I am still waiting for a invoice for my stay which was over 1 week ago. I booked the hotel online their website directly and upon checkout was given an invoice for the amount paid except for the deposit. On asking for a full receipt for the total amount I was told I would have to contact some other company that I paid the deposit too. As far as I was aware I had booked directly with the hotel and while their online booking system may pay some other company for the privelige offering this service to guests it doesn't help if you need a complete invoice for the full amount. I was eventually told that they would email me an invoice for the full amount as I need this to claim as a work related expense. I am still waiting for the invoice and this is also after emailing the hotel to ask where it is.....still not response to the email and that was sent 10 days ago. Other minor disappointments were the mention of a bar in the hotel guide in the room but on going downstairs to have a drink I was told they don't normally serve alcohol in the bar.....why is it a bar then? Decided then to have a drink from the mini bar fridge but as there was no bottle opener provided and after waiting for half an hour and no one brought one up as requested I gave up and went to bed. Apart from this bad experience that will hopefully get rectified shortly this hotel is located only a few minutes walk from Victoria station. Price seemed good for what you get. Room was clean and had modern furnishings.,cellini03
UR106273776,2011-30-April,We booked on-line through "Hotelclub.com" and we booked an overnight stay which we up-graded to a deluxe room with full English breakfast included. We received our hotel voucher and booking confirmation several weeks in advance and so thought that all was well. Upon arrival at Topham's in mid-afternoon we went to the reception desk to check in and that was the start of our problems. The hotel staff immediately caused upset by denying that we had not got a booking even though I handed them the booking voucher with our reservation details. The woman on reception tried to blag us by saying there was a room for us anyway and asked me to pay by credit card. I had already paid in full in advance and so was not happy. I had to go online using the hotel computer to prove that I had paid by getting a copy of my bank statement showing the cleared bpayment as well as showing them the booking details again. We were then made to wait for over 40 minutes while the hotel staff made phonecalls using telephone numbers that I provided to prove that our booking was genuine. We were not offered so much as a complimentary drink even though it was a very hot afternoon. The room we eventually were shown to would struggle to be called a "standard room". It was small and definitely not the up-grade to deluxe that we had paid for. The shower room had loose floor tiles and the shower door handle was broken on the inside. The shower controls were difficult to operate and the water temperature varied in use. We were at the start of a romantic trip starting in London then Paris Zurich Milan & Venice by train. We decided to just make the best of it as we had no stomach for further upset at the beginning of our dream holiday. I hardly need to tell you that breakfast was a disaster the poached egg and mushrooms had been heavily sprinkled with pepper in the serving dishes and this is not to everyones taste. To top it all the hotel staff tried to make us pay 29 for our breakfast even though we had already paid in advance. The receptionist eventually agreed reluctantly to "waive" the charge. At no stage did any member of staff offer us an apology or any type of compensation. It is hard for me to restrain from using choice language about this experience. There should be a law against such rubbish.,abrownyork
UR102005008,2011-29-March,I went to check in only to be told that some rooms were 'unavailable' and we would be offered a room in their annex along the road. Annex was smelly and rooms unacceptable. I asked for my money back - couldnt do that as we had booked via lastminute.com. I asked to be relocated to a hotel in the same area - couldnt do that as they had a room at a sister hotel in Knightsbride. I was forced to accept this despite the fact that we were going to the theatre near Belgravia and Knightsbridge was inconvenient. Throughout the receptionist was pretty rude and defensive. Another girl did take over proceedings but I felt that they had no real interest in me as a customer and the issues I had. It was take it or leave it!,isobelb52
UR115952545,2011-29-July,Central London can be a nightmare if you need accommodation at the last minute. I understand now why Tophams had late rooms. Stayed 1 night on business. At 176.00 it you don't expect budget standard but I also know this doesn't buy luxury in London. Located convenient for Victoria station but be warned - print the directions. It is not easy to locate and don't even bother to ring the reception staff they directed me on a three block detour. Arriving dripping wet I expected a smooth check in. most of the staff are european and clearly more familiar with the relaxed approach of Mediterranean destinations. Despite needing to mop the spot where I stood for check in they made no effort to speed up the process gave me the wrong room direction and after becoming lost in the labyrinth of tiny corridors a kindly guest showed me to the basement. The room was immediately unacceptable dark (it was in the basement) cold (AC was n full blast) and stank of stale tobacco (despite my request for NONE Smoking). I was re-located next door. n . disturbed a kindly guest who directed me to the right floor/room. Be warned it is a rabbit warren. The shower was fine. Hospitality tray more basic than a travelodge. The digital flat screen TV was experiencing 'interference from the weather' so couldn't get a picture. A failed attempt to access the hairdryer in the dressing table drawer (this furniture is definitely style over substance) I retired to bed. It offered little comfort (is it too much to expect cotton and feather at this price) so sleep was a welcome relief - being in the basement it was at least quiet until the occupants of the adjoining room returned and you realised the walls were partitions and not as I had imagined strong basement supports. Breakfast was continental stale croissants budget cereal a bowl of fresh apple with a 'spot the other fruit' activity built in. I really wish I could find something positive to say.....actually I can. Victoria is renowned for many budget or travel style hotels. Use these and save your money or spend the extra and get actual 4*.,KrinnB
UR118683855,2011-28-September,My friend booked this hotel for a one night stay as it looked lovely online and was close to Victoria station where we needed to be early the next day. On arrival late in the evening we approached the hotel. From the outside it looks nice and reception area is lovely however this is the only good thing I could say about this place. We checked in and were taken outside the hotel again along the road and into another building. We were taken up about 4 flights of stairs (carrying our own heavy bags) and as we got higher up we realised that this was nothing like what we had booked. The wall paper was peeling off the ceiling and you could see damp coming through the walls. The carpets were badly stained with what looked like paint. The receptionist took us firstly to the wrong room and so we were up and down the narrow stairs lke a yo-yo (with our bags in tow)!! When we eventually got to our room it was horrible!!! My friend immediately complained and said that we would not be staying here as it was not what we had booked from the website. They eventually took us and our bags back to reception where we were met with the manager on duty. I say manager but she was no where near a manager. We explained the situation and she said that unfotunately the hotel was fully booked and there was nothing she could do. An absolute disgrace that they had overbooked the hotel and had basically thrown us into a dump next door. She did eventually offer us a room at their sister hotel in Knightsbridge for the night but on looking this up on the i-phone it had even worse reviews than Tophams ad we refused to go there. We asked for a refund and thought we could book somewhere else but she said she could not give us a refund as we had booked through trip advisor. She had a huge attitude problem and was extremely rude when it was the hotel that were in the wrong. She kept saying that she did not have authority to make decisions - well why was she the manager on duty then?? My friend and I decided to leave and booked a hotel elsewhere at extra cost to ourselves. That might sound extreme but if you had seen the room you wouldn't have been staying there either...like a scene from a horror movie!!! Disgusting hotel and poor service!! Would NEVER return!!!!,fl0wers
UR121161749,2011-28-November,On arrival I was told that they had water problems & that the only room available didn't have a bathroom. They paid for a cab to the sister hotel in Knightsbridge there was apparently only one room available it was terrible. When I phoned Tophams they said I had no choice. I told them I was coming back & they had to sort it out. After a fair amount of discussion I got back and a room had materialized it was what I expected & had paid for. There were no water problems. It was lucky I arrived early & was prepared to be insistent but it was a waste of time & I could really have done without the hassle. I feel I got this kind of treatment because I had a deal through an internet booking site.,Walter186220
UR94713595,2011-28-January,i was sold a 4 star and they try to show me a seperate building with rooms which are not even 2 star fire alarms were ringing continually and the room i finally ended up with was a health and saftey liability. do not stay here under any circumstance,edinburgh009
UR94602364,2011-27-January,I booked through Travelocity but Lastminute also sell rooms here as a Secret Hotel. The room cost 139. On arrival I was asked for 50 deposit despite the fact that I had paid up front and wouldn't buying any extras. Was shown to my room 308 which had approx 2ft free space on two sides of the single bed. On the other sides wall. There was no toilet sink bath or shower Following a short discussion I was taken back to reception and the team searched for a better room. They did find me one 309. However I got confused when I went to the new room and went in the old one instead. Needless to say the key worked for both rooms. The room was newly decorated and the bed was okay. The bathroom was dirty and full of long dark hairs (nice) there were no hand or floor towels. However pleased with my room I settled down to watch the telly and lo and behold the channels were not tuned in. The room with no loo suggests someone trying to rip me off. The telly the key and the towels suggest an owner who has no experience of running a hotel. I dread to think what there fire procedures would be if they can't organise hotel basics. The way the staff were treated (can't say any more without risking this backfiring on the team) suggests a completely immoral operation. I have written to travelocity and am waiting for their response. I wont be using them until they take this hotel off their list.,teresacrowd
UR105827968,2011-27-April,We booked online with Tophams and supplied credit card. They charged an extra $260 and will not reply to emails or faxes. Absolutely no reason to not refund- do not trust this hotel,traveldfw
UR121009106,2011-25-November,The afternoon tea we had here was atrocious. Poor service abysmal sandwiches and shop bought cheap cakes. Yet they are still selling "reduced cost" afternoon teas through Groupon.

UR117215124,2011-25-August,First two rooms I was given were grubby and didn't look like they had been properly cleaned since the previous guests had escaped. Finally given another room on the top floor (no lift). Had to get my key changed as it didn't open the outside door (my room was in the building beside the one that reception was located in). The whole experience was summed up perfectly by another couple of guests who when finding me stuck outside trying to get in told me not to worry and that I shouldn't be in too much of a rush to get in as I'd only want to leave once I'd seen the state of the place! My advice is... don't go there!,Paul M
UR105477369,2011-25-April,We were going to treat ourselves to a weekend break in London looking forward to some rest relaxation and entertainment. This was our Capital City and always seemed to offer the best in accommodation and activity. We decided to use one of LastMinute.coms Top Secret hotels for our stay in London. The priority of our booking was that the room should offer Twin Beds. Not too many hotels offered such a room so we decided to especially go for this Top Secret hotel as it offered Twin Bed rooms. On booking we were advised that our hotel was a 4 Star hotel. It was the Tophams Hotel in Belgravia and our booking confirmed a twin bedded room. We received the written paperwork to this effect. The Tophams Hotel was advertised as one of Londons newest four-star hotels providing the ultimate in style comfort and peaceful surroundings in the heart of Belgravia. With this concept in mind we proceeded to the hotel. We were looking forward to our weekend break in London but the reality was a far different story. The Hotel was a hotel from hell. On checking in we were told that our double room was ready. We told the receptionist that we had booked a twin bedded room and had confirmation in writing from Lastminute.com; which I was able to show them. They said the booking they had received was for a double room. However they never showed us this booking. They said no twin rooms were available until the next night. This was not acceptable but the receptionist did not seem to care unduly did not seem to have a full use of the English language. Eventually she offered us an upgrade which would entail putting a single bed into a Mews double (Mews 5). We said we would look at the room before any decision was made. On entering the room there was a musty smell dirty carpet and closed dark curtains. True there was a Double and single bed: which in truth was a camp bed with tubular legs. It would probably have taken the weight of a child but doubtful of the comfort for either a grown man or woman. Half the lights did not work the room was small and no room for the furniture within. Then we had the shock of the shower/bath/toilet area. This area went below the road and was suffering very badly from damp. The paint on the walls was peeling in many places including within the shower cubicle. Mould was everywhere. It was disgusting. It was unhealthy offensive and certainly not what we had paid good money for which the hotel and Lastminute.com were all too quick to receive from us. The only thing that was worse than this was the second alternative we were offered namely Mews 4. The bed was smaller the sewage smell even more overpowering the wet carpet the brick wall view from the window. Certainly a far cry from the description of their website which said All guest rooms at the Tophams Hotel are finished to a very high standard of modern comfort and style. We declined the offer of this room and once again reiterated that our booking was for a twin room money had been accepted for a twin room. As a last resort the girl behind the desk offered to book us into the Vegas Hotel for Saturday night and we could return to The Tophams on Sunday when a room would be available. After checking this latest offer on the Internet we found the Vegas Hotel was a 3 star hotel but we had paid for a 4 star. They did have a twin room available but the pictures on the website were not appealing and the reports on Trip Advisor would have been enlightening. We also mentioned the Vegas Hotel to the French family as they were really stuck for accommodation at short notice on seeing them at breakfast the next morning they had also declined this invitation. We were rather surprised at the lack of Management over the weekend but according to the receptionist there is never a manager present at weekends. We were amazed at this due to the activity of the Marathon and 2 football semi finals meaning the City was packed with people. Our visit to the dining room for breakfast was again a disappointment. We were told we could have a Full English Breakfast but firstly we had difficulty getting to a table as they were put so close together no-one could access the row behind if people were sitting on the tables at the front. 14 tables in a small space take some manoeuvring around. The food was on one side of the room but when we went to take up the full breakfast there was no bacon hash browns the sausages ran out before we could get there almost no scrambled egg. It was a long wait and in fact I had finished the breakfast that was available before the bacon arrived from a chef who was cooking who knows what who knows where. There seemed to be only a service room no kitchen nearby the dining room that we could ascertain. On Sunday when we came back in the afternoon we were advised that the twin room we had been allocated was now ready and so we duly took the key to investigate. The room was a great deal better than the previous one but one of the curtains refused to open (jammed) the beds seemed narrower than usual the lights were not all working in the en suite and when I went to have a shower the shower door came off in my hand! Once again we had to notify reception and they said it would be sorted. If a maid had opened the door to clean the shower she could have been injured as it was the complete shower door that gave way. The tiles on the floor rocked as you walked on them the painting and decor in the en suite left challenges to quality and once again the price paid was not matched by the service offered. All in all it is the last time we would go to this hotel my wife has assured me that it is the last time she would trust Lastminute.com Top Secret.,kernowlad2011
UR119662431,2011-24-October,We recently visited the Topham Hotel in Belgravia on a"special deal". afternoom tea with champagne for 2 for 28. The hotel is in a rather seedy part of Belgravia and looks a bit like a run down bed and breakfast. On arrival we were directed to the very small cafeteria like Dining Room. It was very noisy as the accoustics were poor there was a party of about 12 women on the next table competing with a heavy rock music music track.All the guests appeared to be on special deals. We were handed a grubby tea stained menu which informed us that afternon tea with champagne was normally 67-00 per person ! We were served by a very young and nervous looking waitress with a pot of tea with 2 tea bags and a chipped milk jug and some sugar sachets followed by a 3 tier stand with 9 small sandwiches 6 minute shop bought cakes and two doughy scones with just enough jam and cream for one. We had to ask for our champagne a clean milk jug and some more cream and jam. We ate as quickly as possible and left visiting the one disgracefully dirty toilet on the way out. Never again !,cyndot
UR109607964,2011-24-May,I booked this hotel for two nights through Laterooms.com. unfortunatly I had to cancel this was confirmed and was done at no charge as per the terms & conditions of the booking. My Barclaycard was then charged 318.00 by the hotel for the two night booking. I am having trouble getting the money repaid by the hotel and have had to contact Barclaycard.,Htcancel
UR101366765,2011-24-March,Taken as a Top Secret Hotel via Last Minute at a supposedly well reduced room rate. On arrival it felt like someones house staff were miserable but polite. A 100.00 deposit secured on plastic was insisted upon before we were allowed to our room which was pre-paid in advance. There was a lift to all but the 4th floor. Passage ways were very narrow and cluttered with dirty laundry and vacuum cleaners decorations along passages were scruffy. The room was generally pleasant with a split level bathroom. The toilet seat was about to fall off the illuminated mirror did not work and the plug and chain for the bath was detached from it's retainer we were told to just pull the plug out with the remaining loose chain. The temperature in the room was about 25 degrees C and could not be reduced without opening the window as wide as possible even though there were A/C controls in the room they did nothing. We did not eat at the Hotel as the Dining Room never had anyone in it which is an indicator? We did try to get a drink at the "Bar" one evening they only had one bottle of red wine and a few bottles of lager so we declined. There are lots of well priced Bars Cafes and Restaurants close by. We did get a leaflet under our door for take away food which says it all. Regarding the 100.00 deposit on more than one occasion we overheard conversations from other and previous residents all trying to get their deposits back we still await ours. We did get our toilet seat repaired within a short time but nothing else. Overall this Hotel is not really a 4 Star quality at all maintenance seems to be lacking and some areas need attention. The only really good things were the bed which was comfortable and the cushions which were quite nice.,Hodroyd
UR115710481,2011-24-July,I went for afternoon tea at this hotel with my husband and two friends. Admittedly we were on a 'Two teas for 20 voucher' but this experience was dreadful. This hotel has no idea how a cream tea should be!!! We had booked a table for 3pm and arrived at 2.45pm. We were shown into the breakfast room which was actually set up for breakfast and told to sit anywhere. Our order was taken and the pots of tea were brought up immeadiately. Whilst we were waiting for our food to arrive I heard the couple at the table next to us ask for some clotted cream ( a staple of a traditional cream tea) only to be told that there hadn't been a delivery that day and so there wasn't any. I called over the manageress who confirmed that there was no clotted cream but offered to whip up some double cream for us. 40 minutes later with still no food I asked the waitress when our sandwiches might arrive she offered us our glass of 'Champagne'....I asked again for our food and also to speak to the manageress. Finally our food arrived... Oh dear...I wish it hadn't. The sandwiches were made of disgusting stodgy white bread with sweaty cheese and tastless cucumber. Admittedly the smoked salmon was on Hovis so marginally better!!! The cakes were abismal. 1 slice of carrot cake 1 inch slice of shop bought cream doughnut and two sexless flacky pastry things....1 scone each and watery cheap jam...NO CREAM!!!!!! The manageress was very appologetic but assured us that all the cakes were freshly made and could she offer us a glass of 'Champagne'. She brought us a glass of something pink and fizzy but Champagne it wasn't.....it wasn't even fizzy wine!!!! I had two glasses and if there was any alcohol in either of them then it was very well hidden!! Unfortunately for this hotel has no idea how to serve a cream tea. At 64 I would have walked out..to be told that people stay for three hours and can't believe what amazing value it is was quite frankly insulting. My friends and I regularly have afternoon tea and have several to compare this to. Harrods for one is the best afternoon tea I have had....even Garfunkels offer better value. This is obviously aimed at foreign tourists who don't know any better! What a shame. This experience stands for everything that is wrong with the british tourist industry ripping off tourist at every opportunity and giving a really bad view of London. Do yourselves a favour avoid this place like the plague and take yourselves to Harrods!!!!,shoefreak
UR94241696,2011-24-January,We had a number of problems at this hotel but two were top of the list. First and formeost the kitchen staff were simply unable to cope with the demands of breakfast. Supplies of bacon sausages baked beans and other elements of the great british breakfast were intermittent and on Sunday morning most guests were left short. I had no cooked breakfast at all while my wife made do with a single rasher of bacon. Secondly the televison did not work and when I reported this on our first of two nights I was assued it would be fixed the following day. This did not happen and by the time we left it was still not functioning. At checkout I listened to a litany of complaints from other guests including one from a couple who had had to put up with a noxious smell of drains in their room during their stay. I am writing a formal letter of complaint to the hotel management who incidentally were completely unavailable to help their staff.,cmsmyth
UR120955587,2011-23-November,The Tophams Hotel is situated just minutes away from Victoria coach station in the heart of Belgravia - which was perfect for us. On arrival the staff were not overly friendly (a smile would have been nice!) but we were able to check-in to our room early which we were very grateful of. The room was lovely nicely decorated with a bath and separate shower cubicle - useful ironing board & hairdryer - and a flat screen tv. Unfortunately we could hear every door bang shut and every footstep from the floor above us - meaning no sleep until about 3.00 in the morning - followed by the fire alarm going off 5 or 6 times (for 10 seconds each time) at 7.00 in the morning. Needless to say we were exhausted the next day which spoiled our weekend. Breakfast was included (otherwise 15.00 for Continental / 20.00 for full English) - this was ok there was a selection of muffins fruit cereals yoghurt and toast - but not worth 15.00 if you were paying. On departure we left our bags in the 'left luggage' room. When we came to collect these later in the day we were made to feel like we were being a burden on staff and they were reluctant to let us use the toilets - which even resulted in a male member of staff (assuming the manager) following my husband and checking in the toilets when he came out!,HayleyHunt
UR117059814,2011-22-August,The hotel is promoted as a newly renovated luxary hotel. At a first look this seems to be the case but a closer look reveals a cowboy operation. The hotel is clearly lacking some finishing touches.. At arrival the cleaning lady was still in the room when finally left alone it only took 10 minutes before another member of staff entered the room without knocking. We then wanted to lock the door but found that the lock did not work. Other things that did not function was the fridge and the remote control. During the night you can choose to leave the extremly loud air con on or switch it off and sweat it out. Now time for breakfast...,Karin N
UR118420518,2011-21-September,I booked a single room well in advance. I arrived and was taken to a tiny room with a huge crack down the wall measuring maybe 12 ft square without the furnishings and finish as seen on the hotel website.The shower room and toilet is separate and shared. When I booked I was told this would cost 344 for wed and thurs. I am here now and have to stay as I can't find any rooms elsewhere. The customer care is very lacking. I can't speak with the manager as he left and is not reachable apparently. I have been told I will have a better room tomorrow. Wholly unacceptable. Ironic that the course I attended today covered how to deal with patient complaints. If you're thinking of booking please don't.,lmerc
UR120886046,2011-21-November,Had a reservation for their main Hotel which they claimed was full. They walked us down the block to another Hotel. Not only did it not have the promised amenities ( not even an elevator) it was a basement room smelling of mildew.After much complaint they found us a room in the main hotel in another basement room. I won't bore you with the legion of problems ( non working lights loose plumbingbad mattress etc.) but the capper was my IPAD got stolen as well.Stay away both the couples before and after us who checked out had their own lists of complaints as well.,Offbway
UR100934460,2011-21-March,I was sorry I had booked this hotel when I checked Tripadvisor - usually I would check it first but I booked in haste and then wished I hadn't. I wanted to stay there as I was attending a conference very close by and wanted to be able to walk to it. I emailed the hotel the week prior stating I wished to stay there & not be moved & wanted a nice room after reading some v bad reviews. It took 2 emails for them to respond & they didnt allay my fears. On arrival we got some joke of an explanation that some rooms had been flooded & they wanted to move us to their sister hotel. I said absolutely not & that I needed to stay there as I had a conference close by & that was my whole reason for booking it. They eventually found us a room - to insult us by saying the rooms were flooded was a step too far for me. They clearly always overbook the hotel & try to move people to their sister hotel. Our room was extremely small but well furnished & comfortable with a decent sized bathroom with a nice shower. We didnt have breakfast or spend any time there apart from sleeping because I was so annoyed with what they had done. I would avoid this hotel as they are dishonest & there are plenty of better hotels that wont mess you around.,Cara79
UR114621110,2011-21-June,I have never felt the need to write a review before but... The good points are: it was warm (and even too warm). The bed was comfy and the staff were pleasant. The bad points included: My door key did not work on 3 separate occasions (no apology). Each time I had to go back down to reception. The DVD player did not work. A young lady did come to sort it out and managed to open the DVD player but unfortunately did not wait to see if the player could read the DVD. When I rang down again it was suggested that I change room. 25 minutes later a different lady came to take me to a new room. The DVD player still did not work along with the warm fridge and burnt out light bulbs in all 3 lamps. I am still waiting for the DVD player to be mended. The Room service pasta (9) looked and tasted like a microwave meal tipped out onto a plate. I am also still waiting for my wake up call but fortunately the noisy lift woke me up instead. I had a continental breakfast (11.95) included in my stay but many of the advertised items on the menu were not available and so I had orange juice one piece of sliced bread and tea all served in a cramped and stuffy overheated room. (No applejuice  no pineapple juice no fresh bread/rolls no marmalade. Almond croissant was solid uncooked pastry: inedible.) This room was discounted on the internet (laterooms.com) from 745. I have stayed in better hotels for example 19 in a travel lodge. My overall impression is that all the advertising and descriptions are a deliberate attempt to mislead. I will never book here again and I suspect their clientele are passing through and will not be going back either! Avoid this place at all costs.,LostKevinPerry
UR115621023,2011-21-July,I am not one to say bad things unless warranted...okay let it be said that this hotel is owned by the same person who owns the Park Lane Mews in Mayfair... The hotel rooms staff location etc. needs help. No place in the lobby to sit and relax without being in the way of the copy machine or staff. The staff yells at the help in a middleeast-type language the floors creak like you wouldn't believe no soundproofing the rooms are boutique-itsy my mirror was cracked/missing...it took them 30 minutes to get me a ride (who turned out to be their driver with no meter and a high charge!) when I asked for a taxi! NO TAXI-DRIVER had EVER heard of the place so it was wretched to find! But hey at least I had a desk and intermittent wifi. I like some boutique hotels but I did not like this one and I paid top price! Sorry. Really I had high hopes - but they were dashed especially when they had NO DOORMAN to help me up the stairs and into tiny elevator w/my luggage. On a 1-10... 3 (clean linens teapot and fireplace ambiance helped enormously). I do not recommend this...unless they drop the price dramatically and rate it a 2 1/2 star in order to be honest with their potential clientele. Again sorry for the review but others should know. We are all in this crazy travelling world together and being away from home shouldn't be an awful time!,MsMobileConverg
UR93952822,2011-21-January,There is no way this is a 4* Hotel!!! The room was barely bigger than the bed within it there was no coffe making facilities the room was painted a grey-brown which was flaking in places there was a small tv but with bad signal perhaps worst of all the bathroom was along a corridor down a set of stairs and open to all the other guests - and it was cold! To briefly summarise the disaster of my stay (which only lasted from 11pm on the 18th to around 8.30am on the 19th!) 1.Upon arrival I was not asked whether I wanted a wakeup call morning paper nor was I informed of the hotels facilities such as bar or breakfast arrangements. The staffs English was poor but they were polite. 2. Bedroom was shocking and the bathroom was not private was cold and the shower took over 20 mins to warm up. 3. I visited the bar for a night cap they did not stock spirits and spent 30 minutes looking for a bottle opener in which time I decided to call it a night. 4.The cooked breakfast was not served until almost 8:30 at which point I had waited since 8 o clock. 5.Upon check out the card machine would not work (consequently I received my breakfast complimentary the least they could do!). Furthermore they did not have the courtesy to ask how my stay was!,jonathanbarnes
UR120831145,2011-20-November,Arrived at the hotel service was OK at best during check in. I was escorted to the room to be fair. Got to the room which to my surprise did not even have a bathroom (or sink) in it and i had to use a bathroom which was located up a short flight of stairs round the corner from the room. The finish in the room was poor with exposed wires up the wall leading to the TV cracked skirting boards and not even a mattress protector for the bed. I was very surprised to hear that the hotel was only refurbished in 2008! The room did not even have a telephone in it to contact reception and no guest welcome book or letter. My key card stopped working and when i had left the room to take a shower and could not get back in my only option was to go down to reception in my towel in order to get the card fixed! This happened not once but twice during my stay. When i asked why it stops working i was told that i had kept the card too close to my mobile phone! The lift was extremely temperamental and often did not want to work. When i told reception about this they told me i would just have to wait. There was no room service (something you would expect from a 4*) and the noise throughout the early morning and the day time was crazy. Doors slamming very loud and lots of banging on the floor. However by far the worst part of my stay was the fact that the loudest fire alarm i have ever heard was located in my tiny room and rang each morning at a ridiculous time. This really did make for a terrible start to the day. On the plus side the location is good in Belgravia and the hotel is very close to Victoria station. I know though that there are far superior hotels in this area for a similar price. The hotel is really not up to 4* standard is overpriced and i would advise people to look at alternatives in the area.,sam j
UR115589078,2011-20-July,I booked this hotel on Expedia - the pictures looked great the reviews weren't the greatest but I thought people rarely go on and write good reviews. My first impression of the hotel was that it was actually quite nice. The reception area was small but cozy you could see into the breakfast area and it was decorated well. I was quite shocked when the receptionist who was helping us said come this way and proceeded to take us down the street (about 100 meters) to one of the other parts of the hotel. We were taken to the very end unit (I belive it is called the Belgravia) where we had to carry our luggage up two flights of stairs (isn't so bad but we weren't even offered assistance). Once in our room it immediately smelled like mould. I wanted to leave but my boyfriend didn't want to make a fuss. The room was small it was noisy the shower drain didn't drain properly so you would have to run the water to get yourself wet shut the water off lather turn the water back on and hope that it didn't take you too long or else the shower would overflow. It was obvious that the drain had been a problem for a while as you could see the black on the edges of the shower. The cleanliness on other levels wasn't there either - upon arrival I had a cup of tea and left my cup to be exchanged the next day when they cleaned the room - but they didn't they simply rinsed it out and put it back to be reused. It was also an extremly noisy room in the middle of the night I could hear people running up and down the stairs yelling and screaming. The phone did not work which is a big concern especially when you don't feel safe because of the people you can hear inside. We did ask about the phone not working because we needed to make a call they brought us into another room (which they said was going to be occupied later in the day or else they would have given it to us) to let us use the phone but it didn't work either. That room was actually quite nice with no smells. It looked like the picture they advertise. Overall it was not what I expected. I would never recommend it to anyone or would I go back.,l0945
UR93889720,2011-20-January,Unbelievable ! smell of raw sewage in the annexe rooms . staff are clueless. bar does not exist as they don't have anything to drink.I witnessed the staff being rude to other guests. very disorganised. the fire alarm going off at 7 in the morning didn't help but that could happen anywhere i guess. The rooms / bathrooms only just above hostel standards. if it was 50 a night it might just be acceptable. Having read some of the other reviews i would strongly question the author any review that says anything remotely positive about this hotel. MJR.NT,MJR50
UR98654734,2011-2-March,This was a company booking made and prepaid through laterooms.com on behalf of customers visiting our company from overseas. 3 rooms for sole occupancy had been confirmed and paid for and yet upon arrival at the hotel our customers were informed that the hotel had allowed other guests to extend their stay and therefore would only be able to allocate 1 double and one single room. Thankfully an employee had driven our customers to the hotel and was able to negotiate the rooms that we had booked. The attitude of the staff was poor and unapologetic and as a previous review stated the hotel "lacked the most basic level of service". I have contacted the hotel via email to request feedback on how this occured but as yet have heard absolutely nothing back from them. I would not recommend using this hotel - certainly not prepaying to secure a room as unfortunately the payment and confirmation does not actually secure any such thing.,clairaki
UR111066349,2011-2-June,Staff stood around chatting to each other I was totally ignored rooms very small & shabby furniture. On the plus side.... nice central location,thecables2
UR91377371,2011-2-January,A poorly run hotel with unprofessional staff and terrible facilities. Good location but that is little compensation for the wretched experience of staying there. The other reviews give a good impression of how awful this place is.,32
UR119490774,2011-19-October,Booked room at Tophams Hotel through hotels.com. Paid in full on non-refundable rate. Arrived at hotel to find room was unavailable. Stored luggage and went for meeting. Upon return was shown to my room out of Tophams hotel down the street to the Belgravia Mews Hotel (see tripadvisor review for a laugh). Was shown into ground floor room facing the street the room smelt awful of damp and old cigarettes. Refused the room immediately. Spoke to manager at Tophams and threatened legal action and a report to westminster trading standards before got put into a "Tophams Room" which was of course what I had booked and paid for. It seems that Tophams try and offload unsuspecting visitors into the Belgravia Mews hotel. Frankly I think this is shocking and I have decided to make a formal complaint to both English Tourism and Westminster Trading Standards for misrepresentation. Avoid this hotel under any circumstances!!!,AMcK2011
UR108996382,2011-19-May,I checked into the hotel tophams last night which I booked through lastminute.com through the top secret hotel. When I checked in the double room I booked was not available and they tried to put me into a different building of the main hotel. As soon as I walked in I could feel the dampness and even see the mold on the ceiling. I told them that I would not stay there and it was a health hazard. I was then given a single in the main building that was not ensuite did not have a kettle a working phone tv or an iron in the room. All of these things were gaurs teed as part of my booking. I then had topack my bags so they could finally change me into the room I booked but not till the afternoon since the cleaning staff did not arrive till later so I had to used the shared bathroom. Every time I asked to speak to a manager I was told they were unavailable. If I had wanted to stay in hostel conditions I would have booked that and saved over 100 pounds and probably had better service. The hotel did give me a free English breakfast for one day only which in my opinion does nothing to compensate not having kept the room I reserved and the appalling treatment and service I have received. Since the hotel seems to not be willing to take any action to amend this I believe it is last minute.com's responsibility. By choosing a top secret hotel I was guaranteed certain amenities which were not even close to provided. I spent the first night in a single room with no toilet working tv kettle or iron. I would like at a minimum of a return on my first nights stay. I can say for certain I will never use the top secret hotel again. I will also being posting this to trip advisor and other travel blogs and would in the future hesitate to use lastminute.com at all.,Murdog21
UR114392349,2011-19-June,We went for afternoon tea in June on a kgb deal. At best everything was ok. The staff were extremely variable in terms of service. Of about 6 (reception and waiting) staff at least 4 looked pretty miserable or unfriendly. However 2 of the ladies serving seemed reasonably attentive and helpful. The decor of the downstairs lobby/ hallway area is nice but everything goes a bit downhill from there. When we arrived at our table there were crumbs and dirt around - it hadn't really been properly cleaned. The food quality was poor - very cheap fizz and cheap tasting cakes and sandwiches. Feels like an afternoon tea based on cheapo ingredients purchased from somewhere like Lidl or Aldi. I was disappointed. Apparently this is worth 32 per head but the quality you get compared to other places in London like the Montcalm and Swissotel The Howard (which have had similar offers) is far worse. I'd have been really angry if I had paid that much. Overall I'd like to thank the couple of staff who tried their best to make the experience pleasant but in general feel this to be quite an unprofessional shoddy service vastly in need for someone to come in who knows what they're doing. I wouldn't recommend the afternoon tea even at deal prices there are much better afternoon tea deals available at other places.,Saffron3000
UR115536528,2011-19-July,TV remote did not work no tissues in the room no laundry bag toiletries consisted of a tiny bar of soap and a sachet of indiscriminate gel. Buffet breakfast was not properly stocked (bacon holder empty.) Bar does not serve alcohol !! Great location for Victoria about the only redeeming feature. Maybe the relatively cheap rate for a single room booked online may explain sloppy standards but I have had better at half the price.,janus09
UR120761144,2011-18-November,Unfortunately despite the impressive impression one gets when considering booking this hotel on the Internet the reality is something very far removed from that. I booked a room via late rooms in October paying the full cost upfront. However on arrival and after being given the keys to the room I found that somebody else was actually already in the room causing much embarrassment. When i was "instructed" to return to reception by a super rude receptionist I was told there was no room in the inn and asked to leave. Thats right asked to leave. I eventually managed to persuade the front desk that I had paid up front for this room and had nowhere else to do and for them to suggest moving me on to a sister hotel in Knightsbridge. The sister "hotel" however was a considerable step down (That is being generous) in quality and offering none of the benefits which I was originally attracted to in the first place. So in light of the above most people would feel hard done by and expect some form of refund or apology from the hotel. Nothing of the sort. In fact in over 7 weeks of attempted correspondence not so much of an acknowledgement. I am considering sending in the guys from Rogue Traders. Appalling service total and utter disregard for guests avoid this hotel!,Guest556
UR108756773,2011-18-May,This has got to be the worst hotel I have stayed in. Firstly the Receptionists are not friendly and very disorganised. The hotel rooms are tiny. I tried to open my room door and it hit the bed it was so close certainly a H & S Hazard. The bathroom was disgusting dirty and the grout was black in the shower cubicle. The bed was too soft and lumpy and sloped. There was no quilt cover on the bed it had 2 sheets folded into the quilt. The throw was covered in stains and the towels did not get replaced on a daily basis they were folded up and put back on the towel rail. The breakfasts were shocking and the waitresses spent too much time faffing about wanting signatures and room numbers. Their service was a disgrace and the food was disgusting! Only good point was the location very central. I would not touch this with a bargepole!!!,WWTraveller_11
UR115481991,2011-18-July,I arrived late at night at Tophams (11pm) and all i wanted to do was order room service and go to bed! Upon arrival this hotel looks nice reception etc was well decorated ( i suspect a small number of their rooms may actually be decorated like this and hence look like what was advertised) however it only took a few mins for me to be given the 'we have overbooked' scam that is mentioned repeatedly in other reviews. I was then taken down the street to a 'mews apartment' which frankly was a grubby squat for want of a better description it was truly filthy and i would not let a stray dog sleep here. Tiny room with a toilet inside a cupboard and an open shower in the room which had leaked on the carpet (which was stinking) next discovery was that the single ( child size bed) had dirty sheets with a hole in. The window had a one stage been forced open and did not lock.....how could i have left my belongings in this room or even have felt safe to sleep here. I picked up the in-room phone to call reception to find it was disconnected. I used my mobile to get the number and call reception as soon as i spoke to them they did not seam at all surprised i was not going to stay and immediately offered to transfer me to their 'sister hotel' in knightsbridge. When I arrived back at reception with my case i spoke to the manager/owner (his staff - all foreign- seamed quite intimidated by him) he assured me that the other room would be nicer. I got in a taxi and arrived at The Knightsbridge Green (now midnight) I was told there was no kitchen here so no food available I was annoyed but checked in anyway. I was then told that my room was on the 6th floor but the lift only went to 4. Lift is like a cage so was glad to get out on the 4th floor then discovered i had to lift my own cast up 2flights of tiny stairs (this can not meet fire safety regulations) I got to the room and found that it was worse than the 1st hotel. It again had an open shower in the room.....it was filthy and it smelled of vomit. The windows had barrs on and did not open ( to get rid of the smell). I immediately left the room and went back to reception.....i felt this hotel was repulsively dirty and i was afraid that it was a fire risk! The receptionist called the manager from Tophams and i spoke to him on the phone - He offered for me to stay for free....i told him my safety was not going to be bought and i wanted the room i had booked (the one we have all seen on their web site) or i was leaving. He kept trying to convince me to stay but i gave the phone back to the receptionist and used my mobile to speak to Late rooms who my company had booked this through they spent over an hour trying to find me another hotel (this was not an easy job and ended up costing me 600 pounds for a few hours sleep) However when the manager heard me complaining to late rooms about their establishment he got very angry and asked the receptionist to make me leave the property. I asked the receptionist to call me a taxi but he said he couldn't as his manager would be very angry ! So I was left alone as a young female traveller outside their hotel in a deserted street with no taxi and nowhere to go. Luckily laterooms came through and found me something and sent a taxi to get me. So i got 4hrs sleep before my conference at a price of 600 pounds but it was worth it to escape the hell that is Tophams and the Knightsbridge Green! All i can say is please please do not stay here. It is a scam and its not just comfort that is at stake it is your safety !,pink-princess
UR104486317,2011-18-April,My complaint to the hotel.... My partner and I were booked in to be guests at your hotel on 20th January for the occasion of my 30th birthday. Due to emergency surgery the week before we weren't sure if we would make it but as he theatre we were going to was within walking distance of your hotel we decided to still go ahead with the trip. When we arrived I did note that the room wasn't quite up to the standard I expected as there was paint peeling from the ceiling in the bathroom (wasn't the place recently refurbished?!) and the temperature in the room was very cold. However we decided to grin and bear it and went out for the evening. Only to return to have a bath and when we tried to run the bath it was leaking. My partner also opened the wardrobe before this to look in the mirror and noted that one of the hinges was missing making it impossible for the door to stay open. I went to reception and we were told someone would come down. Twenty minutes later - nobody appeared. I had to have my gallbladder removed so was still in a bit of pain so my partner went up this time and we got moved rooms. It should be noted that we had paid for a king size and we were moved to a double. Only to find that the tv was damaged and unwatchable and the safe looked like it had been broken into with batteries exposed and the front missing! We complained again being told the tv could be fixed the next day but I wasn't happy as the room was a lot smaller. At 11pm at night bearing in mind we had travelled down from Glasgow on that day which was tiring for me as I still wasn't 100% and it was also my birthday....my 30th so we were hoping to have a nice quiet night together. We were moved to the knightsbridge green hotel which was lovely....on the outside! Bearing in mind we had chosen your hotel for the location as it was near the theatre we were then moved a 10 taxi ride away. When we entered the room we were told by I have to say extremely friendly staff that it was your best room. The wallpaper was peeling there was a rusty handle in the bathroom (I was very worried about germs after recently coming out of hospital!) the ceiling was cracked there were damp patches the light fittings had parts missing and the tv in the living room didn't work. I have taken pictures and if I do not receive a satisfactory reply to my complaint I will take this further. I can't believe it was classed as a four star! We put up with it as I was so tired and quite deflated. The only thing that made it was the staff were so lovely. I also left a phone charger there and it's supposed to be getting posted back to me but as yet hasn't arrived. I will be contacting trading standards if I am not compensated accordingly. We had such a stressful time and as you can imagine my 30th wasn't all that I had expected. I'm so unhappy about it and it's not like I will have another one to celebrate. Definitely put a dampener on things. I have taken photographs of all the defects and will be passing these on as well as placing several reviews on travel sites and contacting lastminute.com to advise them that I booked it through them and how awful it was.,KirstieCB
UR119384311,2011-17-October,I booked 2 nights at this hotel the end of June...after a long day arriving at 10.30pm i waited in the reception area (which is lovely!!) for 15mins while one of the receptionists "prettied up" one of the old awful rooms in the old part of the hotel...i was taken out of the new part of the hotel down the road to the old part of the hotel that hasnt been renovated at all....big mistake!!...it was smelly with rotten carpets..chipped dirty paint work everywhere...and the room was awful.I walked straight out back to the reception and asked for what id actually booked a fully renovated double/twin room with ensuite... the receptionist looked blank and shook her head...and offered me a room without ensuite..and another room for my daughter...without ensuite but with a bathroom way down the corrider passed many other rooms which they said nobody else would be using(as you will see from other reveiws other people use the bathroom too!!)..although both rooms were okish as in clean but tiny..i had come to London to spend time with my daughter...and had paid for a room with an ensuite..i requested my money back several times and was told she couldnt do anything until the morning...i refused to stay at the hotel and was offered no help to find a different hotel...its honestly a shambles...after months of emails and slow correspondence i have received NO refund and NO apology or even an offer of an upgraded!! ensuite room for any of my many trips to London i booked through Lastminute.com..who also werent as helpful as id expected although did give me 20% refund as i am a frequent customer!!.. total shambles ...i suggest you avoid at all costs!!,pinkgreen_diamomd
UR115456479,2011-17-July,We stayed just for 2 nights. We had to share a double room even though we were booked a twin room. Reception staff don't know the meaning of "hospitality". Customer service and friendliness non existent by reception staff. We asked for toasted sandwiches...we got 2 slices of cold toast with slice ham/cheese between & tomato & cucumber slices in a bowl. Breakfast was fine with reasonably pleasant staff. The bar had closed a few weeks previously. Great location...but wherever did they get a 4star rating from??? We got one bath towel plus a few small hand towels each day. As I say it left alot to be desired.!!!,fusciaCork
UR115423435,2011-16-July,To set the scene I stay in London most weeks and so I have stayed in a lot of hotels in London - some good some bad and then Tophams! In June London hotels are usually fully booked and this June was no exception. Booking last minute is always a lottery but Tophams took the biscuit. I was charged 193 via Laterooms and so even at London prices it should have been bearable. however it was the worst I have stayed in. I checked in at 6.30pm and so was given the last available room which was shockingly bad. Firstly my en-suite was actually a shared bathroom halfway down the hallway. Secondly the room was the size of a postage stamp and the miniscule cupboard didn'ty have any coat hangers. Thirdly there were no curtains and so when dark the hotel opposite could see me in all my naked glory and as it is June I was rudely awakened by the sun at 4.30am. The room was smelly (there had been smokers in there before me and some dodgy food smells) and prisoners at Wandsworth prison would have better amenities than Tophams offers and they wouldn't have to pay 193 for the privilege. To be fair to the reception staff they agve me 10%(!) off the final bill and offered to give me a free evening meal but as I would have had to eat tuna pasta bake or chicken korma (the only options) on the bed of my postage stamp room I felt there were already enough smells in the room. To give a balanced review the breakfast room was pleasant and the staff were at least embarrassed by the room too. In summary if this is the last place in London and you have 193 spare then just drive around in a taxi all night.,Jamessearby1
UR113623664,2011-15-June,I booked this on last minute .com as is said it was boutique etc. The staff are lovely girls very welcoming check in was really smooth. The rest is downhill we had room 207 right beside the lifts!! noisy all night!!! The floor covering's were filthythe mattress was cheap not 4 star!!the shower in the bathroom had a broken holfer so I had to shower with the shower head in my hand.The sound proofing is minimal and I could hear what was going on all around me! The decor is border line ok quirky and fun at reception but the room was smallest I have ever stayed in I would not recomend this hotel if you want boutique in this price range go to the Rafayel it is boutique clean and spacious with good food on offer!!,paul meekin
UR115392553,2011-15-July,Unfortunately our experience mirrors several others on these and other review sites - really wish I'd not been in such a hurry and read them first! We booked an "Executive double room. Breakfast included. Brand new stylishly decorated rooms with King Size bed etc etc". When we arrived we were taken 50yards down the road outside the main hotel and shown a grubby basement room with none of the promised facilities. We complained and were and were given the 'sorry overbooked but we do have a room of the promised standard in another hotel' story. We went along with this and were taken to the Knightsbridge Green where again the room was standard at best (in a shabby rundown sort of way) without bar or restaurant facilities and being advertised as 4 Star (that's not flattering advertising - it's lying!). Complaints to the manager illicited promised upgrades and reimbursements - I am not holding my breath. I do not usually bother with writing reviews but in the light of similar stories of this 'overbooking scam' thought I would add mine to the list.,Acba10
UR121763642,2011-15-December,Booked under --------- - supposedly a four-star upgraded boutique hotel. It really isn't. It really really isn't. I was marched 30 yards down the road to the Belgravia Mews hotel. Down a stinky hallway and the stench continued downstairs. Dingy room. Not one coat hanger in the wardrobe. Shower door missing. Horrible mattress. Still trying to understand why I stayed. Maybe I had to experience it in order to save others. I've quite often used ------ but not sure if I will so so again - they shouldn't be guiding customers towards the Tophams of this world.,golfingmates
UR104113864,2011-15-April,Arrived at the hotel after a 12 hour flight from Sri Lanka my mom had booked the hotel as part of my birthday present. After reading mixed reviews on the hotel she specifically asked for us to be placed in the main hotel and also told them of our time of arrival. When we arrived we were told that our room had been double booked and sure enough was offered a room down the road in one of their annexes which turned out to be a grotty single room without facilities. My girlfriend and i returned to the hotel and complained and after about 3 hours which was about 1.30 in the morning by now was offered our money back so that we could get another hotel. Half hour taxi there and back the next morning to see the manager who still was no where to be seen. A receptionist offered us a room for a few hours to freshen up in while we waited for our coach A terrible end to a lovely holiday!,janejaneypp
UR115365450,2011-14-July,The title sums up how desperate I would need to be to consider going back. They had a room for us but it stank - literally stank. It was that stomach churning dank moldy smell and very overpowering. The carpert was stained and the paint was peeling off the walls. We explained the situation to reception who said nothing could be done they were fully booked. I raised the issue again when checking out to be told that we should have asked to be moved the night before as they had rooms spare!!! (we stayed on the 13th July). The excuse was that they had been flooded!! They promised a manager would call us today - no phone call. 350 spent on the worst hotel stay I have experienced to date.,WillowJersey
UR100045115,2011-13-March,On first appearances this hotel is nice clean and pretty. My only problem was that the window in the bedroom a huge sash window did not lock and could be opened easily by someone on the outside especially as there was a flat roof outside the window. I told reception and said how worrying and dangerous this was. The receptionists did not care and said it might get fixed in the morning. If I wasnt staying with a friend I would have asked to switch rooms. It sounds minor but it wouldnt be if a burgular had broken in be aware!!!!,Traveller1187069
UR115326319,2011-13-July,My husband was booked into Tophams by the company with whom he was doing business. I had read the scary reviews but did not want to be a bother to the UK company and thought well forewarned is forearmed right? Wrong!! I called the hotel personally the day before our arrival to let them know that we would be arriving at around midnight and was told that this would not be a problem. Then lo and behold upon arrival the receptionist disappears for about 5 minutes comes back and tells us that we would have to go to another hotel. I protest vehemently as a shadowy figure of a man lurks about. I ask if he is the manager and the girl says no he is a guest. We say we are not leaving but she was just not budging (at first saying that the previous guest had been sick in the room and then claiming that the bed was broken!). She calls a cab and as we are waiting another cab driver pulls up and asks if we need a hotel recommendation at which point the shadowy "guest" comes out and yells at the cab driver to mind his own business. The cab takes us to a 2-star hotel called the Dover which had never heard of us and was completely booked. Yay - its now half past midnight and raining. This is when we call the police who though wanting to be helpful let us know that this is a civil matter and would need to be filed at the station the next day. The gentleman at the Dover was absolutely wonderful in letting us use the house phone. We then called Tophams who said oh sorry we meant for you to go to the Hotel Windermere. The Dover gent gave us directions and off we went on foot into the rainy London night (or morning technically). The Windermere had a room for of us but said no payment had been made by Tophams (as they insisted would be the case as our original booking was 100% prepaid!). So GP140 later we get a bed. Wow just wow. We moved to the Radisson the next night (a fine enough business hotel) and then to the Zetter Townhouse (heaven on earth!!). Soyeah this place is essentially a criminal operation.,Vera348
UR103880392,2011-13-April,On arrival to the hotel I was immediately told that they were overbooked. Even though they had all of my details in front of them on the desk they had obviously released my room as I arrived late at night. The same thing had happened to 4 other people while I was standing in reception. There was no manager on duty to talk to - apparently he was at the theatre and not contactable! This left two inadequate receptionists who had no clue about customer service. Aswell as me there were two other travellers who had returned from travelling in Sri Lanka - they had booked into the hotel online but had no money left and no credit card and Tophams Hotel were not going to relocate them without a credit card. This is disgraceful! I had a credit card so the hotel rearranged accommodation for me in another hotel which was on the other side of London. When I got to the other hotel it was extremely basic and was not of the same standard at all although the staff were extremely helpful. This was a complete inconvenience for me as I had booked Tophams Hotel so that I would be close to the location for my business meeting the following day. I would not risk booking with this hotel as obviously their systems are inadequate or just plain inconsiderate.,ClaireT50
UR92708464,2011-12-January,This is a very weird hotel. Having stayed in over 100 hotels in London this ranks most peculiar. If you're a single male business traveller you're probably okay. The worst you will get is a feeling you've ventured into Twin Peaks territory plus a bad night's sleep. You probably won't want to buy your PA a present for getting you a room here but you probably won't die. Probably. If you're bringing you're partner here by choice then it's a shrewd move if you're aiming to quickly end your relationship. (And vica versa if your partner brings you here assume they either don't use TripAdvisor or have had enough of you.) My favourite bit was when I got woken up in the middle of the night by one of the receptionists banging on my door because they were looking for a spare bottle opener. Classic mental.,TKMaxx_Yorkshire
UR107839993,2011-11-May,We turned up to check in to a double room which we had pre-paid on lastminute.com. When I arrived we were told that the computer had malfunctioned and that they could only offer us a twin room. Given that we'd prepaid for the room and had a double confirmed we were unhappy and calmly expressed this to the staff. They then offered us two alternatives. The first was to transfer to a "very nice hotel" in South Kensington for which they'd pay the taxi fare. The second option was to stay in rooms they owned a couple of doors up although the rooms "weren't of the same standard". Given that we'd chosen Victoria for it's location to the station we thought we'd have a look at the rooms on the same street. We were shown what could only have been a two star room which was reminiscent of a dirty student dorm - the bathroom was small and dirty and looked like one in a ship's cabin. We then decided that we'd try the option in South Kensington seeing as the rooms were "very nice" We had to meet friends for dinner but were reassured that we could come back afterwards and then be transferred to the other hotel. We arrived back after dinner we waited for a taxi for 15 minutes and one of the girls pre-paid it. When we arrived it turned out that they hadn't paid enough so we had to pay for some of the taxi. The hotel was nowhere near a four standard hotel and we were made to pay an additional 75 to stay the night there. We were initially made to think that it was part of the same hotel chain. However it was was a completely independent hotel that they had just booked. Given that it was 11pm we were too tired to argue and went to bed. We had been reassured that our credit card would be refunded in the morning. None of the girls on the desk are allowed to offer refunds - only the manager is allowed to do that. To date it hasn't been refunded and when we've tried to get hold of the manager he was unavailable. After reading the reviews on this website it seems that these problems occur frequently and staff are forced to lie about the source of the problems. I would advise that this hotel is avoided at all costs,The_Wylie_Coyote
UR96217258,2011-11-February,This is a difficult review to write......as I had a very different experience from my colleagues I was with. We booked through Lastminute.com and paid 85 per room per night booking at the hotel is currently 185 for a standard room. When we arrived the hotel reception looked nice but agree with everyone else who says the staff are scary and incompetent! The first worrying thing was that one guest was already complaining that the keys seemed to open every hotel room door and that they had had something stolen from their room. And other staff were refusing to take phone calls which sounded like complaints! The next problem....we booked 3 rooms but after one of us was given a key we were asked if we knew each other as they only had one room left but that it was a suite! Obviously we were annoyed but I was given the single room while the guys took the suite. Reception gave some hopeless excuse for not having a room and other guests arriving later were fobbed off by being told their payment hadnt got through and they were being move to a different hotel. What was offered as a suite turned out to be 2 bedrooms separated by stairs but with the bathroom inside one of the bedrooms not exactly private! My bedroom luckily was really nice I was told Id been given an upgrade as it was all they had left. I could pick up on small things shower door was off the rollers few light bulbs out wine stains on carpet but overall the room was lovely and well worth the 85! Breakfast was like a comedy show 15 for toast that burns on one side and bread on the other and cooked breakfast didnt arrive until 90 minutes into breakfast. One angry guest (understandably so) had been told breakfast was on its way waited nearly an hour the chef finally turned up by which time he had already gone off and come back and all the cooked breakfast was gone! You were lucky if you got some! Meanwhile my colleagues were move to their own rooms down in the basement where people have spoken about! They took me down just to show me....the rooms were horrific Im not normally someone to complain but they were so unhygienic I was horrified. The rooms stank of drains and damp the carpet was so wet you had to walk around with shows on there was no hot water and the wallpaper was peeling from the walls from the damp conditions. After complaining they were told they were the only rooms they had available. Neither of them managed to get much sleep at all. Personally I couldnt have stayed in that room for more than 2 minutes! They have now complained to lastminute.com who are looking to give a full refund but they should stop selling rooms at this hotel until it is sorted!! Oh and they don't serve alcohol in the bar! It also has a food menu in your room but we were told they don't serve food apart from breakfast! Even though there is a sign at reception to book dinner!,Destinystar123
UR116565281,2011-11-August,Booking 2010 - The Goring was fully booked with many other family members and so I booked The Topham Hotel (in our own name and credit card) a twin room for 3 nights for my employers sister - (a VIP) and her daughter who were in London for a large family wedding who wanted to be close to her immediate family who live in Belgravia. Tophams Hotel were aware of our name and the guests names. I went in advance to book in person and received an excellent and attentive service from the very sweet receptionist and was assured that our specific requirements would be met the guests were expected on an early morning flight from USA. The receptionist was very helpful and kindly informed us to telephone on the morning in question and that if no guests were in the room our guests would be welcome to check in at 8am or if any previous occupants vacated early they would get the room ready first so that our guests could check in before 2pm at the very least we could check in their luggage as early as possible. On the day I telephoned early on the morning to be informed that the previous occupants had checked out but they would not get the room ready any earlier than 2pm. We rang later and were informed that the room was ready for check in and we went on ahead with the luggage (to unpack and prepare their personal items). We were met with a disgruntled guest arguing with the receptionist! (not the one who had made our booking). We then had to wait an eternity whist another guest was checked in at snails pace! The foreign and unprofessional receptionist with an attitude problem refused to let us have access to the room to leave the luggage or even to give us the keys. We very calmly and patiently explained the situation (several times) and this made her even more resolute and demanded that the staying guests HAD to check in themselves and give their own C/C details we were informed that she would not deal with us (even though the booking was in my name fully paid and they had my C/C details AND I HAD ALL PAPERWORK WITH ME!!! . It could have been a scene from Fawlty Towers! In between all of this a friend of hers came in to chat a black guy wearing a baseball cap and hoodie and upon seeing my face she told him she would speak to him later and he left. By now (approx 15 minutes later) my patience had deserted me and I very forcefully told her to bring the manager to sort this out immediately before I lost my temper - I was told the manager was off sick! I had to tell her to get me someone who had at least minimum intelliegence and common sense and told her there was going to be a lot of trouble if we did not get into the room RIGHT NOW! She went off and returned with someone else who asked us to take the luggage to the dining room thinking that someone was going to take it up to the room we did so and returned to reception to be told that we could leave the luggage there until our guests checked in (in a public unsecured area)! I retrieved the luggage which was in the process of being moved to the kichen by a kitchen employee?? I told them it was well after check in time and demanded the keys immediately and asked for someone to bring the luggage to the room (suprise - there was no one available)! The girl was told by another employee to take us to the room - we were met outside the room by cleaning staff heaps of used bedding and cleaning items AND THIS IS WELL AFTER CHECK IN TIME. Apart from a huge cobwed floating on the ceiling the room looked small but okay however another problem was that it was a double room not a twin room and was told by the same receptionist that as it was mother and daughter that it should not be a problem for them to sleep together!!! I was told they were twin beds pushed together and that our guests could seperate them if they so wished. I told them the guests would be arriving very shortly and ordered THEM to seperate and prepare them without delay as per our booking and specific requirements. I also asked if the cleaners would be moving everything out of the hallway before they arrived and was assured they would. 15 minutes later we took the guests to the hotel and the receptionist again tried to demand their C/C details eventually we go them to the room where we yet again were met with the cleaners used laundry in the hall and cleaners just finishing off in their room. I did not have any further dealings with the hotel but am informed that it was not a good experience and our guests also did not even go down for breakfast there despite payment for breakfast appearing on our C/C statement! A great pity as this little hotel is in a good location (I live in the same street) and could be a hidden gem but alas not what it appears. Unprofessional amateur and appears to be run by basic staff with no authoritive management. Ideal if you want a roof over your head and not too concerned about service or anything else.,suzanna c
UR107641048,2011-10-May,170 should get you a decent room for the night. First impressions not bad. Great location and quiet road. Nice reception area but then the problems begin. Room cramped and very stuffy - air con is just that - a con! Boutique style but shabby fittings and poor cleaning standards. Breakfast service lamentable and check out staff had the customer service style of a 1970's Woolworth's check-out operative. Really incredibly poor. Avoid this and don't line the pockets of the owner!,SixthSense
UR114932454,2011-1-July,Arrived on Friday evening and was informed there had been an issue with systems and we would be moved to sister hotel. Sister hotel was awful dirty dank horrendous and the lies from Tophams Mgt appalling. Do not ever book this hotel! We had to make alternative arrangements at 1am in the morning to stay elsewhere. We have reported this hotel and the group to Trading Standards and Lastminute.com,STF26
UR95148647,2011-1-February,I jumped on trip advisor and looked up my secret hotel just booked - as it is rated 4 star and had a bar a restaurant - I was keen to see what my husband and I were getting for our anniversary. After reading the reviews I have asked for a refund as I do not want to go through any of this nonsense at the Tophams hotel - sounds like a racket!!! - I called the offshore call centre at last minute and was informed by 3 people I eventually spoke to I could not cancel my reservation and I had read the description incorrectly - the description states the hotel features a bar and restaraunt and is located just a short walk from Victoria. I was told this meant the bar and restaurant were located just a short walk from Victoria and were not in the hotel and not to expect a bar in the hotel itself. I am writing this just now and will follow up on my experience but if this hotel is not removed from last minutes site or the description changed I hope to take this further.,Hamealdaeme
UR82739360,2010-9-October,Nicely located near Victoria Station and surrounded by many breakfast cafes and dinning restaurants. However our experience staying 5 nights at the Tophams was far from great. We booked the deluxe king room which provided a double bed. However this was our experience: the room was far from king size and provided a terrible 'spongy' mattress very bad TV cable reception water leaks in both bedroom and bathroom and mildew here and there. And to our surprise there's no sound proofing between foors and rooms this is unacceptable for a 4* hotel. Some hostels can be better and far cheaper... Business centre is equipped with a PC and two printers but only the PC works. So don't expect to print your own boarding pass etc. such details would need to be email edto the Tophams front desk... also their DVD selection is limited and films are dated. Very expensive hotel and not good value for money.,gcxbjames
UR82550964,2010-8-October,I got 2 options> Room in the annexe (not vacuumed no light plastic foil on the bathroom floor no elevator) or room without facilities but with light! (but no coat hangers glasses hairdryer and almost no space to put my feet on the ground) The sheets had been used before. I guess this hotel is used for hourly purposes!,Gaby080
UR66899505,2010-8-June,Arrived at our Hotel to discover the twin beds we booked were unavailable - despite the fact we booked 3 months in advance. Offered us a double bed with a free sub standard breakfast. Awful smell throughout the hotel. Fire exit had around 20 smelly bins blocking the exit. On Day 2 were offered a twin room but we had to turn them down as the smell was so musty there was no way we could have slept in them. Our bags were temporarily lost and eventually found them in someone elses room. Location great but would suggest you AVOID AT ALL COSTS,Sean3108
UR55479853,2010-8-February,Although the location and decor of the hotel is good I don't think I'll be returning. I think this hotel must have changed ownership - I first stayed there a year or so ago and facilities were good (they had Molton Brown then and they do have comfortable beds in a quiet but central location!) and the staff back then were quite pleasant. Now I checked in and was shown to a basement room smelling of sewers and my colleague was brought to another building altogether to a small dark room without the nice hotel decor but they proposed to charge the same. To be fair when I complained I was given a better room. However the staff are disinterested to the point of being rude. On checkout the porter was too busy surfing the net to get my bag from the left luggage room I was charged for minibar items I didn't consume and have heard similar stories from other colleagues. The internet access is also very slow and unreliable which is not ideal for business trip. It's really a shame as it was a real 'find' initially but now I really couldn't recommend the place - they should really work on staff attitude customer service and having the little touches that make all the difference.,AgTaistealGoMinic
UR60656257,2010-7-April,Went through the same procedure as most people report turned up at Tophams with a "confirmed" reservation only to be told they had no rooms left....was shown a manky horrible room down the "mews" refused and was offered a "suite' at Knightsbridge Green Hotel plus taxi. It was clear that we would be charged for the night even if we left to go somewhere else so we accepted the room at KGH. This was substandard to say the least but at least we had a room for the night. Girl at KGH asked for our creditcard again but we refused to give it to her since we had already paid at Tophams and had been told the bill had been settled in full. Well Topham charged us 139 straight away for the stay AND now KGH have also charged us an additional 139 although we never gave them our creditcard. This is clearly organised fraud. Do not stay in either of these two hotels under any circumstances.,hhelena
UR60530293,2010-6-April,I have booked this hotel from Canada. We arrived very early in the morning just to drop our luggage at the reception they confirmed our reservation for a King superior room. Back in the afternoon they told us a complete different story and asked us to stay at their sister property which is very poor and show us a room in a basementw/ no window no closet to hang cloth..terrible. our other choice a room upstair not really better but at least w/ windows (But w/ no privacy in the bathroom and had to go back at the "main hotel" to get toilet paper soap and shampoo) A real joke.. Take a look at the pictures ...it is far from their website ... I will never use this hotel again.Totally dishonest no respect for customer TO AVOID...DO NOT BOOK INTO THIS HOTEL !!!,chrismic2002
UR82019020,2010-4-October,All the reviews I have read since I booked this hotel are correct. I was shown my room in the annex hotel along the street and immediately asked to change room. The room (no 12) was a basement room with NO windows and no working ventilation no bedside tables and no mirror and painted brown all over. The person who showed me the room told me it wasn't possible to move. I went back to the main hotel and complained politely they took me back to the annex and showed me room no 11 also a basement room horrible and again no working ventilation. The basement of this hotel has a very strong smell of damp. I explained them that I understood it was against the law not to have some form of ventilation. They said they would fix it the next day I said that would be too late. I left and went to the appointment I had and when I returned they showed me a single room in the same building which they told me I wouldn't like they were right it was the most depressing hotel room I have ever seen. Eventually I asked if I could leave the hotel and not be charged they said they hadn't charged my card and this was up to 'lastminute' to decide if I would be charged. I took my case and went back to Victoria Station and found a single room at the Grosvenor Hotel. I will probably have to pay double for that night but nothing could induce me to stay in the rooms offered at the Topham Hotel.,JgwGeneva
UR69653098,2010-4-July,I booked for 2 nights at Tophams Hotel London and when i rang to arrange the booking in February everything seemed fine. I wanted the Deluxe King room including breakfast and was told the total cost would be 320. However upon booking they told me they couldn't accept the booking because my credit card was about to expire (it was actually 2 months away from expiring) and they needed it for authorisation. I then had to call back up 2 months later with my new card. I asked several times for email confirmation that i now had the reservation - they messed me around so many times with this. Various emails said i had the Deluxe King and then i had some saying i just had the Standard Double room. From February right up until 3 days before departure for our stay in London i was calling the hotel trying to get confirmation about my booking. No-one on reception knows the meaning of customer service - i was put through to a French guy who said i had to call back to speak to someone else because he was finishing his shift and didnt have time to talk to me! One week before we were due to leave for London i called again and was told that i only had the double room and breakfast was extra not included in the initial 320 they had told me. I had email confirmation that b/fast was included and they still didnt believe me! Absolutely rubbish service and i wish i had never stayed there. The room we got was so small i couldnt even open up my suitcase properly - No.109 if you end up getting the same 'cupboard' to sleep in. I paid in full on arrival as requested and yet they still had to take an extra 50 'authorisation' too. They dont have a clue how to run a hotel at Tophams. Oh and breakfast was SHOCKING! No milk for cereal on the table so the waitress was taking everyone's bowls into the kitchen to get milk poured on. Sausages and bacon were cold. This was supposed to be a surprise birthday trip for my partner and the only surprise he got was how appalling the hotel was.,lipglossandblack
UR89025549,2010-4-December,Tophams Hotel is clean quite & close to Victoria Station (handy) but it's unorganized staff doesn't even replace supplies you run out of (ex: toilet paper). And it's not cheap. Also ... there was always some argument between staffers and guests or would-be guests at the front desk. We stayed 14 nights and heard about 5. Toward the end of my stay I realized that if there was a fire in the old building we'd never get out of there since we were at the end of a long narrow hallway. Would go for larger more modern less "charming" hotel in the future.,PatAndMark
UR73751630,2010-4-August,Having read the terrible reviews for this hotel I was worried about my stay to say the least however the booking couldn't be cancelled. We arrived to be greeted by an extremely rude receptionist who told us that the twin rooms we'd booked were no longer available and the best she could do was double rooms.... not great unless you're prepared to sleep in the same bed as your travelling partners!! We were given free breakfast instead. She didn;t crack a smile once and was very rude. She also insisted there was no manager she could speak to about the problem.... She must deal with complaints a lot as her speach was perfect...almost robotic!! One room was nice the air con didn't work in the other and one room was damp and smelt musty. The rooms were very small. The receptionist also attempted to take a 100 deposit from each of us in case we used the mini bar!!! The hotel is in a really good location but is very let down by the poor customer service and bad attitude of the staff.,seb2010
UR54843058,2010-31-January,What was poor The facilities not as described: No molton brown. A double bed was two single beds pushed together - with two single mattresses No hand towels No hairdryer What was Poorer A bar with no Gin and no Shiraz The room not made up at 4 pm ( had to complain) The breakfast ( do not have) What was Poorest The staff attitude - lack of concern  lack of engagement lack of any desire to solve issues In summary- I have never written on Trip advisor before- but I can honestly say all the reviews we read are true. This is not a 4 star hotel!!!!,WTBMTB
UR81577094,2010-30-September,Certainly not a 4 star. Reception inviting but then we were taken down the road to an awful downstairs room. Entrance hall had an unpleasant smell. Could have cried when we entered the room. It was so bare. Three small lamps which gave hardly any light at all. Net curtains didn't pull across stains on the carpet small blood stains on the net. Bathroom if you could call it that was up a step and into a plastic unit which we presumed had been fitted into a wardrobe space. The basin was tiny tap had part missingshower was broken and no roller for the toilet roll. We were going to complain to the manager but he never was there . Were also woken on our first morning by we presumed plubing noises and the last straw on the second morning the one curtain and pole fell down. Did tell manager but non apologies.,WolverhamptonCallan
UR69196765,2010-30-June,I wish I had heeded all the bad reviews I read about this hotel -- they're all true. Our rooms were PATHETIC. From the main lobby we were lead back out onto the street and down the block. In this building the rooms were dingy moldy and disgusting. Air conditioning? Forget it. One of our rooms didn't even have a WINDOW to allow air or light in! It was like a dungeon. The rooms weren't even wired for lights! Instead there were plug in lamps all over that we'd have to plug in and out of the wall sockets to turn on and off. The bathrooms were small -- I mean a person could barely fit inside them. The bathrooms on a cruise ship room are bigger and nicer than these were. In one room the TV didn't work. In the other room there was no remote. In both rooms the wires from the TV and lights were just strung all over the place tripping us wherever we walked. Every staff person we met was extremely rude and discourteous. When we inquired about the fact that none of the advertised amenities were included in our rooms the desk person insisted that these rooms were worth 375 pounds a night! Ridiculous. We tried to eat breakfast in the hotel one morning -- all the food was cold and disgusting. Even the toaster didn't work. So a cold piece of bread will set you back another 20 pounds. Don't even think of staying here. Save yourself the trouble. This place is the WORST.,DCTraveller12
UR73659891,2010-3-August,.. is what I got for my night stay in Tophams for 144. I've stayed in hundreds of hotels all over the globe and this stay was undoubtedly the worst value for money I've ever experienced. The single room was incredibly tiny. Even in Tokyo I got way bigger rooms for the same amount of money. It was indeed just an over-sized wardrobe drawer. The room had no bathroom or toilets en-suite! I had to go a floor up to get to "my" bathroom. Yes "my" bathroom since when I checked in the receptionist lied with a straight face that I will be the only one using this bathroom. As it turned out at least three 09 rooms (109 209 and 309) share the same bathroom. 144 for a box and a hostel-like bathroom sharing. They also make sure you pay the bill on check-in :) They already know why. Since it was for one night I did not want to lose my nerves by complaining. I checked out as quickly as possible the next morning never to return again (it also turned out they did not have a record of my payment and wanted to charge me AGAIN so DO keep the receipt!). STAY AWAY from this hotel. Yes London is full of little stinky overvalued holes but this one definitely top(ham)s them all.,7r4v3ll3r
UR88504215,2010-29-November,Myself and three other colleagues booked this Hotel for a business trip on arrival the staff were very distant and unfreindly. My allocated room was in the "Mews" basically the basement. On entering the room there was a distinct and over powering smell of sewage. I complained and a new room was allocated but with no apology. If there is a problem with a room why book it out! The alternative rooms bathroom had a broken floor tile. When we booked the prices differed between us by 130 per night for identical room specs and no explanation as to cost variance. Would never recommend or book again.,Chris_T39
UR72876811,2010-29-July,This is the worst hotel I have ever had the misfortune to encounter. I booked and expected a luxury hotel with many amenities. In actuality we were presented with was a tiny room in a smelly basement in a separate building away from the main hotel that had minimal facilities. We looked a a few other rooms all similarly awful. The price although discounted was still higher than it should be for this apology for a hotel. The staff were completely disdainful. DO NOT STAY IN THIS HOVEL.,alpes2003
UR90935780,2010-28-December,Arrived 27/12/10 at "knightsbridge Green Hotel". Booked this hotel on off the internet. The pictures looked fantastic and location brillant. I walked through the front door to a reception that looked dated and makeshift. Reception staff were in Jeans and jumper not what I would call a "4*" standard. On arrival the receptionist told me about the hotel had experienced technical difficulties...floods electrical and lift problems. DON'T BUY THIS. Hotel overbooked! I think this is a regular occurrance. I actually felt sorry for the receptionist as she looked upset. She was a Actress and she should have been given an Oscar for best performance of conning customers! We got shipped off to the sister hotel "Topham hotel" belgravia. DON'T GO THERE EITHER! Hotel just as bad. Can't swing a cat in the tiny rooms and receptionist is an ICE MADEN. She couldn't be bothered and gave little eye contact and she was like a smiling assisan. Asked fo a bigger room. Stayed in the mews... very cold and smelt. (check out pictures)..All we wanted was a "refund" and to go somewhere else. I might as well asked for blood as they didn't want to budge. I asked to speak to the manager. He was on holiday... then walked in a man dressed in a suit with a super model with legs up to her armpits. Walked around like he owned the joint and demanding why the candles had not been lite. Manager and ice maden rowed infront of customers. Absolutely terrible. Both companies... late rooms and hotel didn't want to refund. It took a stand up row outside on the pavement at 2 am in the morning with the staff to get a refund. Holiday completey ruined. One word of advise.... stick to the established hotels....,gringo170629
UR81194433,2010-27-September,Booked a double room through Booking.com based on room descriptions photos and star ratings. Arrived to be shown a room which so small you couldn't open the wardrobe doors because of the bed and you had to share a bathroom on landing! Said needed my own ensuite (as per room description) and shown a basement room in a building down the road which just stank of damp! Reception was full of people complaining and can understand why! Dont stay here!,Smudger1
UR72598578,2010-27-July,We arrived to the hotel just before midnight and they has been informed about late arrival. We got a disgusting basement room with awful smell. First thing in the morning we went to reception and asked new and better room. We got another which was proper room in "main" hotel. We stayed 4 nights and every day we heard the same complaints about disgusting rooms and that hotel was over-booked. I will never go to that hotel of frauds again.,ninrak
UR57059025,2010-25-February,DO NOT BOOK INTO THIS HOTEL !!! From our experience and pretty much everyone else we met who arrived any time after 3pm to check-in at this hotel it's booking management is at best a total shambles and at worst a total scam. They seem to deliberately overbook the hotel fill the rooms at Belgravia on a first-come first-served basis and then try to either dump everyone else into the remaining dingy rooms or move them to a 'sister' hotel in Knightsbridge which is a total kip. We had two double rooms booked for one night arrived at 10pm after having phoned ahead twice to notify them of our late arrival and to reconfirm the bookings to ensure they knew we were definitely coming. There were several people in the cramped reception ahead of us all in various stages of frustration and anger because of 'problems' with the booking system. To cut a long and frustrating story short we ended up after arguing at length with a very unapologetic manager in a family room sharing a bathroom for the same price as our two double rooms. Oh but they threw in a free drink at the ridiculously tiny bar (which only serves bottles of Becks or Bud - no draught beer) and breakfast - which was a bog-standard 3-star effort. Superb location great looking website and could be so much better but believe all of the bad reviews - this place does a dis-service to every independently owned hotel in London.,BizznizTraveller
UR76867831,2010-25-August,The positive of this hotel is the location- quiet street but really close to Victoria station and attractions. All the staff look like they just arrived from Bosnia and have the attitude towards customer service that would be welcomed in belson. The rooms are tiny and I mean tiny! You only get the complimentary mini bar if you booked the hotel directly with them not from an online agent. It's 2 for a can of coke otherwise! I even went to to the desk and showed them their own web site on my I pad and they were having none of it! I had to pay for my coke without any apology. Our shower leaked because the reception staff phoned us in the room complaining the people below had water running down the Walls. We also had a massive damp patch on the wall in our room. The staff make you feel uneasy and I wouldn't trust them at all. I will never return here. I took a chance as I got a good deal from last minute web site. Please learn from my mistake and go else where. They try and charge your card for stuff you've nit had or used either! I just wish I worked for trading standards!!,dicky1980SheffieldUk
UR88056979,2010-24-November,I was looking for a really good place for my wife's birthday. I booked a King room at Tophams that was said to be spacious with a full bath etc. The room was really small and the bathroom only had a shower. The bedroom carpet was dorty and there was water running down the wall from upstairs. The reception staff were not at all helpful and refused to contact the manager for me. I wrote to complain and never even got a reply. I would never stay in this place again.,APD54
UR68503361,2010-24-June,I booked two colleagues into this hotel directly on their website for a business trip specifically for the Victoria area only for them to be told they were full on arrival even though we had a confirmed booking They were shipped off to an alternative hotel in Kensington miles away from where they needed to be. I will be writing a strong complaint letter and will not be using them again. I can only assume they overbooked themselves.,Suziguern
UR71898963,2010-22-July,Hotel is overbooked every day.They send customers to different hotels without any apology.It was NOT a coincidencethey do it on purpose!They charge your credit card first and then they send you to another hotel where you have to pay again.We argued 3 days to get the refund.Dont leave hotel without refound receipt!It is not a 4 star hotel!!!Staff at reception is rude and unprofessional and constantly lying.Rooms dirty and were not ready at checkin. Equipment not as 4 star hotel.Breakfast poor and not worth the moneythe waitress chaotic!The manager is totally incompetent and not able to organize anything. They charge your credit card by checkin not by checkout.They require an extra 50 deposit for minibar and other potentials. If they send to their sister hotel Knightsbrigde DONT go there it is even worse!,kostohryz
UR84292858,2010-21-October,I regret not reading reviews on trip advisor first but I as in a hurry when I booked a room at this hotel. I made the booking of the room which was non refundable. Then we got there at 22.00. They said they didnt have a room even though they had charged my credit card with 200 pounds.The customers at the lobby were ladies at 40s goggling and laughing they seemed so cheap as to stay at the hotel for some evening hours not thw whole night (if you know what I mean.) again this is what I thought when I saw them. In the end they sent us to a "sister hotel" and didnt even pay for the taxi as they had promised. At the other hotel noone cared about us the room was cold and as I said we paid the money in advance even though this was supposed to be a worse hotel and we should have paid less money. I regret even having visited this place and I hope the management of the hotel wont bother me with apologies since now I now this is what they do for living. Moking potential customes. As I see it they already got customers why need more?,eleni_viglaki
UR90366482,2010-21-December,i stayed here twice; the first time i was on the first floor and had a great experience. this time i was on the mews and it was horrendous. there was water seeping through the ceiling under the glasses and down the miny bar the shower didn't drain and flooded bathroom the smoke alarm went off every time i showered and the toilet gurgled when i turned on the sink faucet. i couldn't take a bath because the lever to switch to the faucet didn't work. i told the front desk and they didn't even offer any assistance. it is affordable it's in a great location they have a couple nice touches serving apples and fresh pastry at reception and free wi-fi in the lounge and in the rooms -- so if you dont stay in the mews and you're not looking for perfection get down with your bad self and give it a whirl.,mervelicious
UR80364767,2010-20-September,I went to London for my Masters Class in Digital Marketing. It was fashion week and all the hotels are fully booked. I tried looking for a good clean and safe hotel that is on the average price per day right after I landed in London. I was able to get a room at Park Plaza in Victoria but only for 2 days. So as soon as I landed to London I decided to look for another hotel where I can transfer on the 3rd day. Most booking websites recommended Tophams hotel whenever my hotel of choice is not available. Tophams is a " 4-star hotel" according to these booking sites and that the price per room per night is a premium at the average of 400 pounds. I was aware of the bad reviews this hotel has been getting from travellers but I didnt have any choice at that time. So I booked for 2 nights amounting to approx 800 pounds. When I got in the hotel I was greeted by their nice staff. The receptionist however was a big scammer. When I got into Tophams she gave me a room with no bathroom. When I told her I will transfer to another hotel because they were giving me the room that's not what I reserved and paid online she pretended to change the room to fit my choice. I later found out that she did not give me a room at Tophams but instead she brought me to an adjacent inn called Belgrave. That Belgrave connected to Tophams looked as if it's part of Tophams. Each unit has its own entrance and I was surprised that each unit has an upper and ground level rooms. I was brought on the upper level and when I entered the room I was shocked. The door was small and made of unfinished wood no internet that means I need to go out in the cold and enter the main lobby of Tophams to get an internet access. I was so suffocating. I immediately told the staff that I need to leave the room to find another one. The staff was polite and told me "I understand." Maybe they are used to hearing musings from disappointed clients. I requested to the receptionist to cancel the amount she swiped on my card but she declined. She told me their policy is non-refundable. I told her that she did not give me a room at Tophams but in its adjacent Belgrave Inn. So she should not apply their terms and policies as they are the one in breach. To cut the story short I left without them refunding my money. I suggest to booking.com hotels.com and other booking sites that they should not include this hotel anymore as I felt scammed as well as the many travelers victimized before me. So I learned that before I hand my card next time I will ask to have a look at the rooms first to be sure. Aside from the fees this scamming receptionist charged a PREAUTHORIZATION charge of 100 pounds. She told me it is not charged at all from my card. She told me that 3x when I was registering. I even asked her for clarification about it. I later found out that my card was charged with that amount. I should've followed my intuition when I read the policies of this hotel when I was booking online. It says "non- refundable". I remember when I checked in at Park Plaza which is really a 4star hotel they charged my card upon check out and not during check in. Watch out for this clever receptionist she is very tricky. Once I arrived she swiped my card immediately and gave me rooms which does not exist in their website.,miagapuz
UR71699275,2010-20-July,We stayed at the Tophams Hotel and will never stay there again. There was no mirror or power points in the bathroom. One of the shower doors was missing and water leaked all over the floor. We had to ask for soap shampoo and toilet paper. The internet didn't work in our room. We complained and they offered us a 15% discount but we had prepaid so we never got our 15% refund and they won't responded to my emails. Do yourself a favour - don't stay here.,jacqui011
UR76019490,2010-20-August,What can i tell you was supposed to be a special night as going off for the day from Victoria the next morning it was my partners birthday treat - arrived at Tophams was told room had been double booked along with 5 Yes 5 other bookings they attempted to find alternative accommodation failed so I had to travel back home and make the journey back into London the following day NOT HAPPY - Four weeks later and I am still trying to get my money back - no-one is interested I think this hotel is a scam they take your money don't provide the service and then you can't get hold of anyone to refund your money - I am going to take them to court and get trading standard involved - VERY UPSETTING - Damn wish I'd checked trip advisor before I booked,kitspice
UR81821991,2010-2-October,I was having to stay overnight in Victoria at short notice due to netting over running and had to be back first thing. Popped in here as a colleague had said it was fine. It wasn't. I was disappointed after handing over my card for 250 room only. The room was so small you wouldn't believe. I cannot believe hotels like this area able to operate in such poor condition. This hotel is nowhere near three star never mind four. The lighting was very dim as was the chap at reception when I asked to change rooms. He said he couldn't authorise it and I demanded he come to my room to inspect the damp patch on the wall. It was disgusting. I wrote to the manager and never received an acknowledgement or response. Yet again another hotel ripping people off. My advice is to steer clear.,DellaNice
UR57546611,2010-2-March,Well well where to start? I'm writing this review the night after a fire broke out in the kitchen of this lovely establishment. I must point out that my partner and I have history with this hotel. We have been in the past one of the unfortunate many carted off to the salubrious Knightsbridge Green hotel because 'they had no record of our booking' despite this booking being made through their website and me waving a booking confirmation at them. This little episode ended with the check-in girl passing me the phone to speak to 'the manager' who had all the social grace of an amoeba and accused me of not making the booking properly. He then put the phone down on me. Nice. I think someone needs to go back to hospitality college. We stayed there last night due to a last minute requirement for a place to sleep and the promise of a good deal to make up for the previous disaster. Oh dear. So fire breaks out in the aforementioned kitchen and we're left stranded on the pavement for two hours while the hapless and mute management flap about. At least the fire brigade and police seemed capable of communicating with us guests. We're eventually let back into the building cue more flapping about and no communication. My partner and I take matters into our own hands and manage to find a hotel around the corner for the next few hours as do a few other stragglers. The best bit about all this is my partner returning to Tophams this morning to find that the previously mute management have gained a voice and intend on charging us the full nightly rate for the aborted stay. How this hotel continues to survive I do not know. They employ some very sweet-natured girls who I feel desperately sorry for having to work for Mr Ali and his appalling management team. They are the ones who have to deal with this farce day in day out.,LondonKate75
UR52355991,2010-2-January,Would like to thank other people who have left reviews which meant that we were ready to do battle with the hotel staff the moment we walked through the door. Sure enough they tried the same tricks as outlined by others in that they did not want to give us our pre-booked room and tried to fob us off with 'alternative accommodation' due to a cock and bull story of a 'security issue' on New Years Eve. We stood our ground made it clear that we were going nowhere that we had heard all about them through other reviews and that we would take legal action if they tried any nonsense. If you have already booked and cannot change it you should go forwarned and forarmed and do NOT accept any excuses. We were eventually given a double instead of the twin that we had booked. The result of this lack of hospitality meant that we felt angry and on-edge throuhgout our stay therefore our break for new year's was ruined. Would not recommened this hotel for any purpose whatsoever!,QuietGuest
UR56372947,2010-18-February,Beware of this hotel's lovely 'boutique hotel' website. You might think you're staying there but chances are you could be sent anywhere in London. We booked 3 rooms in Tophams mainly because it was very convenient for Victoria St. station. On arrival at the hotel we were put through the motions of registering for our rooms and then were told very non-chalantly that they didn't have rooms for us in the hotel and they were going to move us to Knightsbridge to a 'better' hotel. We insisted that we didn't want to stay anywhere else and wanted an explanation as to why this had happened. We got no apology and no explanation. We were then told that they had one room available in the hotel and that there were 2 other rooms in a mews down the street. We viewed the rooms in the mews which smelled of damp and had no working lights (yes! the lights in the room didn't work!). We ended up taking the 3 rooms in the Knightsbridge hotel which was a complete kip. This experience ruined our plans for our night in London and left us feeling angry and frustrated. It felt throughout the complete experience that this was par for the course with this hotel. They use the nice website to secure the booking and then fill the kip in Knightsbridge with the overflow. BEWARE!,Minniemary
UR67805020,2010-17-June,I was the first to arrive out of 6 colleagues to the hotel this week. We have all booked a single room with internet connection. The room rate was c-150 pp something decent for a 4 star hotel in central London. Once I have done the check in the receptionist send me to a room with NO private toilet saying: "you just need to share it with 4 of your colleagues". Once my other colleagues arrived they were assigned to regular rooms. I had to complain to receive a better room and I was sent to their "sister hotel" - 200 mts from the original. The second room was in a basement TV didnt work no mirrors no internet connection and the shower pipes were blocked causing a tsumani after a quick shower. The only window available was right beside the place were the cleaning stuff enjoyed having a smoking break hence no peace and I had to keep the curtain closed no matter what. The following day I tried to speak with the hotel manager to escalate my complaint. However I was told that the hotel manager doesnt work in the hotel so nobody at the staff was in a position to make any decision. At least twice a day i have seen other hotel customers complaining after charged twice by mistake. The reception staff was reckless to compensate customers. Internet connection was poor at any corner of the hotel so I couldnt work properly as I thought I could during my staying there. Conclusion: Dont come to this hotel unless you want to have a hostel experience for a 150 quid a day.,maradona1986
UR79760860,2010-16-September,They never had anything that they promised on their web site. There was no internet no air conditioning and the room was very smelly. There are many clients in the lobby complaining to the manager when checking out but the manager seemed to care nothing. I strongly recommend NOT to stay in this hotel.,citytraveller014
UR90014362,2010-16-December,I booked a single room at the Tophams Hotel in Belgravia. The room was very small no en-suite facilities and no coffee making facilities. On their website it didnt state that some of the rooms did not have these facilities. There was no alchohol served on the premises. I would not recommend this hotel to anybody.,jinglesDevon
UR67597536,2010-15-June,The world's first "four star" hotel with a room without a bathroom/toilet/ mirror and the classic (and absolutely appalling) "sister hotel" option down the street. Throw in the rudest receptionist in the industry and hey presto its Tophams. No manager present no accountability no idea how to run a hotel really. Complaints and heated exchanges at reception - including a fellow guest mistakenly double charged during our stay - par for the course. I was asked to prepare a written complaint for the absentee manager but under the circumstances I think tripadvisor is an altogether more effective forum. The good rooms are fine but why risk it.,DJ1971
UR58521136,2010-14-March,I arrived on the 8th of March and after having waited more than twenty minutes to check in they gave me the key of a room that was already occupied. The day before the departure I check out and I asked two invoices one for one day and one for three days. The morning of the departure at 6.30 a.m. I went to the desk asking for my invoices and they were not ready and it was also impossible to get the receipt of the credit card. I left without it and a friend of mine went to get it later that day but it was impossible to find it. To complete the situation my friend realised looking at her bank account that the down payment has been accredited to her credit card given only as guarantee. Unbelievable!!!!,vistarenni
UR75174431,2010-14-August,We booked a room big enough for a family of 5 at Knightsbridge and were told upon arrival no available room. They instead offered us 2 rooms at Topham. The rooms were soooo small that you could barely walk around the bed. At first they tried to put us in the basement where smelled musty. When I complained about the fact we paid 400 pounds and these rooms were not equal and should receive partial refund I was told each room at this hotel is 400 pounds and I was receiving a deal by having 2 rooms. When looked on website this was wrong information. Customer service horendous and rooms small. Not at all recommended for people with children.,32655Alicia123
UR83084691,2010-12-October,As a regular traveler with business I stay in a lot of hotels and have frequented a large number of London based ones. I have got to say this THE worst hotel I've stayed in from a long time. After a promising check-in at a rather plush reception the experience went quickly downhill. The hotel is spread across multiple buildings along the street and I was escorted to Number 50 - Room 8. The room itself was appalling. The carpet was badly stained and did not look clean the shower flooded when used the tap was falling off the basin the laminate in the bathroom was moldy and bubbled it was noisy - you could hear every other room in the building being used every tap turned on every door closed. The final straw was when the bed collapsed as I sat on it! I mentioned all this at check out and the only comment was no-one had mentioned any of the problems before AVOID AT ALL COSTS.,sbrown328
UR74954684,2010-12-August,My wife and recently graduated daughter booked this hotel the night before a trip on the Orient Express to celebrate my birthday. We arrived from Norfolk by train on perhaps the hottest day of the year. Check in was conducted by various people all from overseas although they all spoke reasonable English in a humourless manner. We also had to pay in full at check in and leave a 100 credit card charge against any further expenses in the restaurant or mini bar. Never been asked for that anywhere else and I am still checking our credit card bill religiously to check there haven't been any charges put against it. On looking for our rooms the lift bizarrely only goes up one floor so we had to carry our bags up and through a maze of corridors. Our daughter had a single room on the top floor and having stayed in hotels all over the world I could not imagine a smaller room in which to spend the night. There was a window but the aircon essential in the heat was so noisy she had to turn it off to sleep. We had a double one floor down which was OK although the very small bathroom was up some stairs via an area with a desk in it complete with hair dryer. We checked out the next morning didn't bother with breakfast admitting to one bottle of water from the minibar for which we paid cash although finding some change for a fiver was a bit of a problem. The man at reception said they destroyed the credit card slips produced the day before if no expenses had been incurred. Nevertheless a few days later like the previous reviewer we had an email from the internet hotel agency we always use for hotels all over the world telling us the hotel had reported us as "no shows" and they were demanding 263 for the two rooms!! Having emailed the agency concerned and having retained all our receipts we appear to have avoided this scam but we have since been charged 1 on our credit card - if all guests are charged 1 and don't challenge it it's a nice little earner! An email to the Manager has produced no reponse. Never again!!,Nigel129
UR74607659,2010-10-August,We booked several weeks in advance and arrived on schedule. However after returning home the booking agent notified us that we were being billed and extra GBP164.00 for not arriving as scheduled. The location near Victoria Station is great and the bed was comfortable but the service was atrocious. The coffee pot leaked there was no cream or powdered cream for the coffee. There were only three coat hangers in the closet and despite repeated requests we were told that no more were available. The shower in the bathroom was too small the door didn't fit and water sprayed on to the floor. Also there was only one very small piece of soap - inadequate for two people for three days. More soap was provided the second day - not by the maid service but only after we asked for it. The grout between the tiles in the bathroom was coming loose and posed a hazard to bare feet when stepped upon. They charged GBP150 in advance for extras we might use such as the mini-bar and breakfast. We didn't use anything and found a great place just down the road to have breakfast at less than half the price the Tophams Hotel charges (GBP14.95). The staff all of whom seem to be of various different nationalities except English were at best very curt and sometimes positively rude. We cannot recommend this hotel and will not go there again.,cfcfan1937
UR57463792,2010-1-March,Summary : Reservation confirmed overbooking no room but charged anyway to my credit card. Manager refuses to refund and offer a free night instead for next time !!! Totally dishonest no respect for customer or hesitation to process undue charges. Add to that rude and unhelpful staff tiling falling off the walls in the rooms heating often not working stinking mews and room service menu rarely available. There is far better value for money in London!!! (Try the Rubbens or the 41 a real treat minutes away from this trap) In more details if you care to read: I am (or should I say now... was) a regular returning guest in this hotel. But one evening when checking in and after taking a print of my credit card I am informed that there is no room for me due a technical problem (The hotel did confirm the reservation which had been made a couple a weeks ago). I am offered to go to their sister hotel. I accept and request a taxi transfer paid for by the hotel. It is late and I wish to make it simple. As I am asking about the facilities of the hotel I am about to transfer to... the receptionist calls them. When I hear her say " yes but the guest is here what am I going to do with him" I do get nervous. She just says that the taxi is coming but she needs to find money to pay the driver. Then after another 10 minutes there are apparently no taxi willing to come (in London no cab !!????). I do get very nervous and decide to call another hotel and check their vacancies. I request the print of my credit card back and leave. BUT... the Topham still charged me for the night. When I found out on my next credit card statement I called the manager thinkingn this was a mistake. He refused a refund and merely offered a night free of charge next time and a long email of apologies available on request !!! My credit card company and I agree this is not exactly the reaction one would expect in a similar situation. A bit of fight ahead!! Overall the place looks great and has been refurbished 2 years ago. But a cheap coat of paint can't last very long. And the staff is far from being professional or even friendly. Summary after trying over 7 different rooms during my past satys: Tiling is coming off the wall in the bathroom humidity stains on the walls (accompanied by the fetid smell) TV not working No heating in winter shower head falling off when showering blocked drains resuting in flooding In-room dining not available or reduced menu only stained bed sheets. And yes I should mention the size of the rooms the poor sound proofing or fire alarms going off in the middle of the night due to problems in the kitchen. NEVER EVER AGAIN,likitornot
UR50878627,2009-8-December,On arrival i was told that the main hotel was full and i was transferred to what until recently had been the staff accomodation in the Harcourt Hotel. My room was up five flights of stairs no lift 51 steps in all. It reminded me of student digs or a grotty bedsit but then that is what it was. I also have significant concerns with its fire worthiness. Room was missing most of the advertised facilities featured a large amount of woodhip decoration and was cold and noisy. Breakfast in the main hotel; cold wet unappetising at best. Avoid at all costs.,grs3101
UR48660894,2009-6-November,Terrible service overbooked rooms the twin room we'd booked was unavailable when we got there so had to share a double bed with my friend. Room was tiny and evidence of a leak from upstairs was obvious on ceiling and down one wall. Free drinks promised as part of theatre package did not appear food was poor. Staff unhelpful and rude. One poor couple were sat in bar area (not open for drinks) after travelling overnight from Canada told they had no record of the booking even though the guy had his printed receipt. No refreshments offered and they were ignored the whole time we were sat with them. They looked exhausted. 1 tea bag between us and no biscuits!!!! The travelodge does better for a 1/4 of the price.,Sometimetraveller20
UR50705428,2009-5-December,Stayed for one night at Tophams. Great location clean looks nice from the outside but staff sort of indifferent not really interested in their clients. Single room was the size of a (small) shoebox very expensive (compared to other & much better hotels where I've stayed in London) and next to a noisy elevator. Breakfast equally overpriced not offering a large choice and both mushrooms and eggs were completely overdosed on pepper. Furthermore the LOUD organ music did not really add to a positive breakfast atmosphere. This also counts for the staff who also in the morning had some sort of vacant look on their face and just do not seem to care. Looked forward to staying there (looked promising on their website) but was relieved to step out of the door eventually. Even though they'd like to profile themselves as a classy stay in Belgravia I could not stop thinking of the expression 'Gloom & Doom'.,flup66
UR45529823,2009-30-September,We stayed at the tophams hotel back in August and it was awful I would definatly recommend to never go there we encountered many problems firstly our booking wasn't even registered then we were sent to our room of which was not what we had booked it was a much cheaper room when we informed them they told us that the room we had booked was not ready therefore we would have to wait for it to be cleaned and we wanted to get ready and go off out into London which we could not do! Then when we got our room the air conditioning didn't work neither did the television on a good point the room was nicely decorated and clean but definatly not worth the money we also were not informed that we had to pay for breakfast (which is so overpriced for what you get) which was then charged to our card without notifing us after weeks of complaining and not hearing a thing I finally got a response to be told that we would be refunded for our breakfast but they just seemed to make up excuses for the other problems we incurred the service is absolutly shocking and we have been treated better in cheap hotels crazy they can charge that much for a room in a hotel of that standard! Please please don't stay in this hotel!!!,BAGGY123Suffolk
UR48068365,2009-29-October,I had booked this for an overnight stay incorporating taking in a West End show. We turned up at the very nice reception and were confronted by a receptionist who made it obvious it was a chore to check us in. After presenting the booking paperwork it became apparent that there was a problem and another guest came to our side. It transpires that she and her family were in the same boat and had been trying to get their room reservation accepted and had been there for four hours without success. When I challenged the receptionist she just walked off and only after some persuation admitted they did not have any rooms but would try and sort something out. I wanted to speak to the duty manager or general manager - they only work Monday to Friday between 9 and 5 ? - and they were the only two reception staff available to deal with these problems. Their efforts in looking for other rooms involved looking at one hotel at a time on the internet which on a Saturday night was wholly unacceptable and it was obvious they were considerably out of their depth. We were left to find alternative accommodation with no help at all from the staff on duty. My hotel booking agency were phoned by me told about the problems and called the hotel. They called me back to say they were horrified by the attitude of the staff and the problem and would highlight this to their own area manager! This speaks volumes! While this was happening other guests were arriving and finding the same problem. The lack of understanding and urgency was shocking. If this was the last hotel on earth I would rather sleep under the stars.,Reiverslaw
UR52082268,2009-29-December,I have never stayed at a worse hotel in my whole life. The staff was very unfriendly and the room (in the hotel annex) was so dirty and disgusting. And early in the morning the fire alarm started and we had to be evacuated to the main hotel building but they were not aware of any fire alarm. I will never ever stay at this hotel (you can barely call it that) again.,VikingMalmo
UR47762788,2009-26-October,I tried the hotel out even though there was mixed reviews on this site. I dont usually leave any feedback but please be warned this hotel is in contravine of fire regulationas and health and safety regulations. Ther receptionist was fairly friendly on check in and my room wasnt ready. When she came back to me I was told that I was in there sister Hotel down the road. When I got there I had been put in the basement room with no windows and no ventilation at all. I awoke in the morning to a smell of sewer!! When I complained the receptionist didnt seem bothered at all and said that she couldnt give a discount as the manager needs to authorise . And if she did she would have to pay out of her own pocket. The hotel was not representative of what I paid for. For 140.00 I could have stayed in a premiere travel inn and enjoyed it more. Fire doors were propped open and there was no legal sinage in the roooms in case of fire. For your own safety please dont stay there.....,mandydingle
UR44476280,2009-25-September,I have never written an internet review before putting any disappointments down to experience. However our experience at Tophams has left me so incensed that I am determined to let others know. Our party was comprised of my parents my brother and his girlfriend and my husband and I. We therefore had booked three rooms. My parents and my husband and I checked in without incident although with all the problems listed already about surly and unhelpful reception staff with very little English. My brother was delayed and both I and my father informed reception that they would be checking in after dinner. We were assured this would be fine. Inevitably on returning to the hotel after dinner to check in my brother and his girlfriend were told that there was no room for them and that they would get another room at the sister hotel. We were leaving from Victoria station on a train at 7:30 the following morning so clearly this presented a problem. However we were left with no choice and my brother and his girlfriend were the third party within the half hour of this conversation to be transported to the sister hotel. They were given a twin as opposed to a double room and the standard was considerably lower not to mention the fact that the location was extremely inconvenient. Also transported to the other hotel was a young couple from Milan. The girl's parents had provided her with the trip as a present for having just completed her degree and they were in a foreign country at 11:30pm without the accomodation that they had every reason to expect. In the hotel reception desk is a drawer full of cash which they hand out to pay for the taxis to the other hotel. As I have said there were three seperate parties who suffered this treatment between about 11:15pm and 11:45pm that evening so let's face it none of this was a simple error. The hotel is clearly over-booking in order to fill another less popular and downmarket hotel. Both my parents and the unknown Italians had been attempting to treat their families to a weekend away and their distress and disappointment was complete. I am incensed that a hotel can be run in such a way and feel that even if you are prepared to run the risk of being moved that you should not book a room in an establishment that clearly has no interest in fulfilling its obligations and providing the accomodation promised. I'm not going to elaborate on the poor level of service as I don't feel this is even relevant in light of the deliberate misrepresentation and lies that are part of the business model of Tophams. Please don't stay here it is an embarassment that a hotel run like this can remain operational in our country.,eggface78
UR50079143,2009-25-November,I can't begin to explain how poorly Topham's handled our reservation with their hotel. Without going into great detail we booked a king size room and received no room. Instead they sent us to a "sister" hotel which did not expect our arrival where we were put in a single room that smelled horrific did not have a functioning air conditioner and was extremely loud. Not only were we defrauded by Topham's it has taken weeks to try to get a refund. Their manager Ali will avoid all calls to request a refund even though according to Trip Advisor reviews it looks as though this practice of overbooking and lack of customer service is pervasive. Do not book at this hotel. It is unlikely that you will actually get a room.,kgpminny
UR51855984,2009-25-December,Having stayed at a number of London hotels I had come to expect certain level of service which this place severely lacked. I had booked two weeks in advance an had recieved an confirmation email.I wrongly assumed this would be enough to assure a room.I arrived at 6pm to find the lobby strewn with luggage.I then asked to check in and was told they were a bit busytake a seat.I was not seen too and had to ask again if I could check in!alarm bells were ringing at this point! I was the told the room I booked was unavailable though pre-booked and there was nothing that could be done! They offered to try help me find alternative accomdationthough the tone it was said in was less apologetic more we're doing u a favour! The staff were unhelpfulclueless and at times rude! If I were u steer well clear!,Rag187
UR50515518,2009-2-December,Booked a room here for myself as whilst on business in London. It was booked via lastminute.com (Top Secret Hotels) and when I found the hotel details out was pleased as it looked to be a 4 star small boutique hotel as described. It wasn't cheap - 150 so I really hoped that I'd get somewhere of fairly good quality. I did have a scan of the reviews now wish I'd taken them more seriously lesson learned! Well when I got to the Tophams Hotel I was told by the member of staff on reception that I was actually staying at another part of the hotel - The Harcourt which was around 4 doors down the road. The main reception of the Tophams looked really nice decorated in a boutique style with a nice fire roaring away and so I hoped that the Harcourt was equally as nice..... Well the Harcourt is basically just a few rooms (no reception/contact point). The porter walked me down there not even speaking to me (chattering away on his mobile). Walked into this 'hotel' where there was another man (presumably a member of staff but not dressed in any uniform) who walked me into my room. Have to say as a single female traveler I didn't feel very safe being alone in this situation. Actually slept with the chair wedged behind the door (silly I know but wanted to feel safe). Fortunately was meeting some family for dinner so didn't need to spend any longer in the room that evening. The room itself had only been loosely cleaned. Randomly in the wardrobe was a plastic pot of microwavable rice pudding (presumably left by another guest). Used tissues under the bed and the shower had lots of black mildew/mold in it. Would not describe as 4 star! However the next morning was when my problems really started. Was woken at 7.15am by the fire alarm going off in the Harcourt so stuck my coat and boots on and grabbed my bags (which were packed) and made my way to the reception at Tophams. On the way a fellow resident said that there was water coming through his ceiling from the sprinkler system. The guy on reception firstly wasn't even aware the alarm was going off (slightly worrying - would have thought it would be linked to their reception?). So myself and another person had to explain what was happening to him. No apologise no instructions about what we should do. For around 5 minutes we received no communication - the guy just flapped around on the phone went down to check the Harcourt and came back saying there wasn't a fire but they didn't know how to turn the alarm off. Again no instructions about what we were to do. Very frustrating - as lots of people having breakfst in the Tophams and I was just standing there in my pjs! At this point I simply needed to have a shower and leave the hotel to go to a meeting so I asked a waitress who was walking past (as the guy on reception was proving completely incompetent) if there was a room in this part of the hotel I could use. Eventually got taken to a single room (why didn't they give me this the night before) which had a separate shared bathroom. I then had to wait for her to bring me up a room key and then to cut a long story short when I tried to use the bathroom the door jammed so I had to go all the way back to reception. Again no instructions about what to do the guy on reception was just tapping away on the phone/computer and ignoring me. So just took the decision to go back to my orginal room had a five minute shower and the hell out of the wretched place. Alarm was still going off but people were in their rooms. Awful incompetent service. I will definitely not be staying at this hotel again. I'd rather pay 70 less and stay at a Premier Inn.,Missmorgan
UR47134048,2009-18-October,The only good point about this hotel is its location in central london near Victoria station. The rooms are so small you cannot even lay your suitcase somewhere some of them are in the basement the mattress of the bed seems to be 10 years old the carpet on the ground so dirty and the window in our room couldn't be closed. The ventilation in the room is so noisy that it's better not to use it. The hotel has absolutely no charm and the style and the furniture are so cheap. The worst though is its value for money. I cannot understand how such a hotel can have a 4 star rating it's maximum a 3 star in reality. It feels like a big rip-off (we paid 150  a night !).,Faircritic2
UR51043842,2009-11-December,Please read this review it may save you a lot of trouble and grief We booked the Tophams Hotel in London as a treat for my mother in laws birthday and recieved confirmation in septemberarrived 4/12/09 to be told there was no reservation and i had booked a weekend package they would have to give us a room in there sister hotel the mews down the street after 2 hours arguing with unhelpful staff who never apolozised once we were took down to what i can decribe worse than a hostel .back at the hotel they suddenly found rooms but would have to pay 250 per night per room almost double what we had on our confirmation.Rooms adequate but shoe box size and door slamming and arguing went on all night as several people arrived with no room for them.one couple from norway said they had to pay 1000 for one night Staff totally unhelpful breakfast cold and the worsest i have ever had molton brown toiletries replaced with cheaper alternatives We ask for the manager on several occasions but he would not come to speak to us No list of room prices and staff very unhelpful when ask for rates we thought we would give a smaller hotel a try but never again i have been visiting london for 20 years and never stayed in a worse hotel Please please please do not book this hotel you could arrive to be left without a room or given an inflated bill i have never written a review before but would want no one to suffer the way we were treated,WilliamIreland
UR51011662,2009-10-December,Do yourself a huge favor and do not stay here. The rooms are horrid and the staff treats all guests as irritants overbooking is common and they do not honor their reservation commitments even with proof. They advertise this place as a 4-star luxury hotel but in my opinion it is not. We (2 adults 1 small child) had one night reservations at Tophams Hotel Belgravia at both the beginning and end of our 2 week vacation to Europe so we could explore London. We were told free breakfast was included and my credit card was charged the full amount for one of the nights months in advance to guarantee the rooms. When we arrived the receptionist could find no record of either reservation and claimed they were full. She seemed genuinely irritated that I was even talking to her. Luckily I had paper versions of the emailed reservation info and proof that I had paid. Only then did a room become available but her attitude remained boorish and annoyed. Regardless she said they would have to bring in a cot for the second bed and we agreed that that would be fine. I then asked her to make certain we had a reservation for our return in two weeks and was assured that she would take care of it. I then asked details about the free breakfast the next morning and was told that none was included. I again pointed to the emails that clearly stated that breakfast was included with our stay and she re-stated that despite what my emailed confirmation said it was not included. I asked to speak to her manager and after a very audible huff she dialed a number which rang and rang and rang. She attempted to call this number several times and no one ever answered. Wanting to get on with our sight-seeing I begrudgingly asked for the room key and told her I would talk to the manager later that night or in the morning. I hadnt noticed the man standing off to the side but upon preparing to exit the lobby area he wished me good luck because he too had been lied to about breakfast was upset about the condition of his room and was waiting for the manager to call or appear to get his money back. Hmm I thought very interesting. We took our luggage to the room and quickly left to see as much of London as we could. When we returned that night we were appalled by the state of the bathroom and upset that we hadnt noticed it earlier because it was way too late to do anything about it now. The vinyl floor material was completely separated from the floor itself and was warped with long vinyl hills and valleys that measured at least an inch high and deep everywhere. It squished under our feet and the sight and odor of black mold filled the room. Of the two beds set up in the room one was nothing more than a cheap folding couch; not a sleeper-sofa but a two part cheap foam couch. It was incredibly uncomfortable and the two sheets spread on top of it were several inches to short on all sides so you couldnt tuck either of them under the foam at all. The next morning we noticed that the shower head was broken. It was the removable wand type attached to a hose but the support bracket that was supposed to be attached to the wall was broken so it required a juggling act to hold the shower head and soap at the same time. Im guessing it had been like that for a long time which resulted in water going places its not supposed too which caused the floor to peel and the mold to build up under it. Not what you would expect at a 4 star luxury hotel. Next we headed down for our free breakfast with my email proof in hand. The morning receptionist was no nicer and no more helpful than yesterday afternoons receptionist so I asked to speak to the manager. Several attempts to call some number resulted in a lot of ringing but never a manager. The receptionist seemed genuinely irritated that a guest in her hotel was even speaking to her. While I was standing there waiting to talk to the manager another guest came in tossed his key on the desk and told her he was going to make sure his company never books another employee at the hotel and stormed out. Hmm I thought very interesting. I guess Im too nice but I got tired of waiting for the manager; there was so much we wanted to see and do in London so we simply left. We returned to London two weeks later and arrived late in the day. We walked in to the hotel lobby and there were two women arguing with the receptionist I had dealt with 2 weeks prior. They had apparently been waiting for hours for their room to be made available and were convinced that the hotel had overbooked and was stalling. They wanted to speak to a manager once and for all. You guessed it.ring ring ring no manager. They were asked to step aside and wait for the room. I stepped up and asked to check in. The receptionist informed me that they had no reservation in my name. I whipped out my emails reminded her about the conversation two weeks ago and she told me that she remembered me but they had no reservation and no available rooms. I told her we had nowhere else to go and had a small child with us and she simply had to find a room as promised two weeks ago and as reserved many months ago but she refused to help in anyway. I reminded her that she was putting two foreigners with a small child out on the streets of London at night with nowhere to go and no knowledge of even where to begin looking despite having proof of a prior reservation. I asked to speak to a manager. She obliged by calling that same number and you guessed itring ring ring but no manager. As we stood their stunned another guest entered the lobby and said his room was unacceptable as it was a mess it smelled but even worse it had no power! Hmm I thought very interesting. Fortunately I had the phone number of a British relative and after a few calls we were able to get a room at a chain called Premier Inns. The room was half the price twice as large extremely clean and it had real beds. So we were fine in the end but do yourself a favor never stay at Tophams Hotel Belgravia.,Roger_Gator
UR48257910,2009-1-November,As you can read in our title we haved booked 2 nights in this hotel and when we arrived there at 10 pm they wanted to give us a inferior "room" with no bathroom ensuite very small dirty walls. Not the one we booked. After argue a lot they offer us to move to the knightsbridge green hotel of the same chain worse hotel. The next day the give us a chance to come back to the topham's they give us a superior room and to be honest the room was beautiful and clean new refurbished with style. But how it could finish it well next morning moment before to leave the guest in the upper room was havind a shower and the water started to leak from the ceiling. I promise it was incledible!,Schna_BCN
