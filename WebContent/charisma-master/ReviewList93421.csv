UR122842165,2012-9-January,Stayed here in Sept 2011.... But forgot to add in my review the several items of clothing missing from my room. Did complain to Expedia as I booked with them. Just make sure you check your dirty linen bag as this is where my items went missing from i did not miss them untill I got home. Just be aware this is a cheap hotel with very LOW standards.,cludasdulac
UR123691428,2012-27-January,We stayed here 2 weeks before Christmas for one night. I am so happy it wasn't more! Although the location is good very easy walking distance to Times Square and other attractions the hotel basically needs to be torn down and remodeled. Old smelly beat up and any other terrible things you can think apply here. Uncomfortable bed a bathroom door in the room that won't close and carpets I was afraid to walk aroun on in bare feet. Run away!!,ThePerk76
UR126636816,2012-25-March,We booked for NYE due to the location and price - it's true "you get what you pay for". $109 per nite a block off Times Square on NYE - what were we thinking??? Upon check in we went to our (1st) room - water standing in the bathroom floor. 4 rooms later we decided although it was extremely HOT and we could not adjust the thermostat or even turn it off we could raise the windows to cool the place down. The conditions were right when we returned: very close very late very drunk and only had to rest a few hours before heading out to the airport.,ShesFromTexas
UR126611354,2012-24-March,So the first few nights were ok then around the third day I started getting bites. At first I thought it might have been something on the street but when I started recieving more and more then I realized that it was Bed Bugs. By the time I got home my skin was swollen and red. I called the hotel to tell them but they hung up on me. So if you dont want your house infested (had to spray mine) then I would not stay here. Just wanted to warn everyone before they went through the same hardship that i did.,tabby m
UR126515751,2012-22-March,Don't expect a 4 star hotel. The place is a real dump but for less than $100 a night for 2 (I found the cheapest prices on Kayak - in the $80 range) & the great mid Manhattan/Theatre District location you won't find a cheaper place. Ok the rooms are a wreck. Naked light bulbs hang from the ceiling. The service is almost non existent. It's rumored that a dead body was found under one visitor's bed. But for location location location (with your own private bath) you will have to pay at least double for not much better. Hey you can get bed bugs staying at the NYC Hilton. Personally I've stayed here about 6 times & never saw a bed bug. The place is probably too run down for them.,Jack Yuken
UR125037013,2012-22-February,I booked this room for a weekend getaway with my cousin. We booked this at the last minute and unfortunately never checked the reviews. When we arrived the hotel was really gross. We were in room 701. The hallway reminded me of a horror movie. As soon as I walked in I knew that this was a bad idea. The tv was from the 50's with missing knobs. I didn't even touch it. Who knows if it even worked. The water took about 10 mins to get warm. Not even HOT. The mattress was gross. I regret even touching it. my cousin and I made a trail of towels on the ground so we can feel safe walking around. We wore our shoes at all times. After reading all these reviews I will never again book a hotel with reading the reviews. My body is itchy now. I never saw any roaches rats or bed bugs. I just hope to God that I didn't catch or bring anything else with me. Stay away from this place! It's not worth it.,BosPretzel123
UR123395866,2012-21-January,I am a high school teacher and my class had chosen the Carter Hotel. Unfortunatly was the hotel full of rats. When students returned to their rooms rats where on the floor. In addition the rats were eating food from the students' suitcase. Students also got many fleabits. We had booked a total of 12 rooms and in 6 of the rooms were rats. The hotel is not recommended for anyone.,Kent C
UR126388805,2012-20-March,Ive been here in 2007 it was my first trip to NY but wrong choice what becomes to hotel it was a very nice price to a very good location but that was the good part... the worst part... was that we had to change room for 3 times... because of... bugs... they call them "Night Bugs" when you enter the room everythings ok but after you asleep they come and in the middle of night we change of room 3 times the last one was in a higher floor so we dont had any problem we also saw a poem in back of the entrance door refering night bugs it was fun to read but not fun to experience it... lol. My sugest is pay a little more a be in a better place,BrunoVicente
UR126354435,2012-19-March,The hotel is located in the center of the time squar . It is very close to the attraction area. No hot water in the shower  no Fridge For two days no body clean the room No paper towles,Ghazi D
UR123237016,2012-17-January,I stayed at the Carter Hotel with my boyfriend when he was home on leave from Iraq last year 2011. We live in New York and recommend not to stay at this hotel. We were both so displeased with the hotel in every area. First of all its right by a stripper joint (which neither had an idea) so whenever my boyfriend and I came in they made us show our card for our room which for a hotel as dirty and disgusting as that is AMAZING! The lobby was dirty the soda machine would not give the soda that we put in for always something different press for a root beer and you get a ice tea. Our room was cold and we could not understand why till we seen that the big and only window was broken. The toilet leaked when we went to flash it. No internet so you have to go to the lobby to pay to use it. I don't mind paying sometimes for it but guest should be able to use it in their rooms. I recommend staying at the POD Hotel in NYC. Its much better its near many great locations. Its been a better experience for us while we stayed at hotels in NYC. I just don't think that people can have a good experience in a hotel right by Times Square unless they are ready to dish out the money.,Tabitha D
UR120377958,2011-9-November,Very dirty hotel when we complained about cockroaches in our room we were simply redirected to another room without any excuses whatsoever. Reception staff wasn't helpful at all rather grumpy and trying to get rid of customers as quickly as possible. Rooms themselves are needless to say very very dirty sheets didn't even fit the beds and everything in the bathroom was painted with ordinary wall paint.,Woudenberg
UR107543335,2011-9-May,My bf and I have spent 4 nights at Hotel Carter and seriously wouldn't recommend it to anyone! We made the mistake of booking the hotel 2 days before coming to NYC and since everything was already booked and the price was affordable we decided to stay here. The location of the hotel is great and very convenient - it is close to Times Square Theatre Distric bus metro... and it is still not too noisy. Apart from the location I also liked that our room was equipped with a bathroom and we didn't need to share it with anyone! The room itself wasn't "too bad" but it was really stinky! The floor was all covered with an old and dirty carpet. There was also a walk-in closet that we decided to leave closed because of its musty odor plus the ceiling was falling apart. The bed was big and comfortable and the bed sheets clean. The bathroom had a strong musty odor with an oxidized bath and very old structure coming apart. The towels were very used and kind of dirty (they didn't change them during our stay) and there was not gel/shampoo. And... if you want a low powered hairdryer you might be lucky and borrow one from the reception. Also we were told that our room would be cleaned every 2 days but nobody came to clean it. Besides that the staff weren't too friendly (like all of them in NYC!) - we had to go twice to the receptionist coz our room-card wasn't working! Conclusion the hotel is old stinky but in a great location. If you are planning to go to NYC book your hotel at least 1 month in advance and you will get some good deals in much better hotels. I don't know how the owner doesn't feel ashamed of having the hotel in such conditions.,inFortCo
UR117850117,2011-8-September,We arrived after a long bus journey on Saturday night so were looking forward to getting into bed. On the front door there was a sign to say 'no more check ins' but we ignored this as we had a reservation. When we got to the desk the rude man said he couldnt check us in and hadnt we seen the signs?! We explained we had a reservation and had already paid for 2nights online. He tod us to look around because lots of people were sat around the lobby all with the same problem. They had an admin error and overbooke by 400 people...! We kicked up a fuss but werent rude and all they said was that it wasnt their problem! Nowhere else nearby in NY had free rooms so we had no choice but to sleep on the floor in the hotel lobby with about 100 other people. 15 hours later...we were given a room key! The room had the weirdest smell...like something had died in there?! We checked all the cupboards but just thick dust and dirt. The room was filthy and the carpets looked like they hadnt ever been hoovered there were blood stains in the bed and up the walls there were dirty marks. The bathroom was dirty with tiles missing and the floor was flooded?!! We moved rooms and it was still filthy but the beds looked clean and fresh! We slept until 4am when we woke up to a loud 'drip drip drip'. In the corner of the room the ceiling had a bulge and water was dripping in..right above the electric socket and down the wall. We were scared about the water near the electrics so ran into the bathroom to grab towels initially...only to find that the bathtub was Full of soggy wet plaster. The ceiling had come away in the bathroom and fallen into the bath! We got dressed and checked out straight away... When we told the lady about the issues of the leak above the electrics and the ceiling collapsing...she just laughed and said...this hotel is old and cheap.. We were so angry we just got out of there! A couple over heard us complaining and followed us to say they had been bitten to death by bedbugs and found a cockroach in there wardrobe! We also got told by police that this hotel is known for hookers walking the corridors drugs and a lady was murdered in 2008!! If ONLY we had read the reviews before booking!! They are all true!!!! Worst hotel EVER!!! Cant believe its still open! Someone needs to shut the place down!! Sleeping in the hotel lobby was actually nicer than the room!!!!,traveller0205
UR99394963,2011-8-March,I was scared to stay here. But upon arrival I noticed it wasn't as bad as the reviews I had read. It's not a dirty hotel it's just 80 years old. And everything is original. It adds character to the place. I would stay again. Very affordable for NYC. And you get what you pay for people! You're not going to pay $99/night in NYC and the hotel look like the Marriot or Hilton.,Ceety02
UR115164411,2011-8-July,This hotel is perfectly located one block from Times Square. This is the only positive thing I can say : it was old and dilapidated. Our room faced a big wall no sunlight at all and the window was sealed. We never had room cleaning in four days in spite of our complaints and if we wanted fresh towels and toilet paper we had to ask it in the lobby and bring it upstairs. The internet costs 10 dollars per day and they can keep your luggage for 2 dollars per hour. The service was awful for check-in check-out and other queries : barely no answer from the staff and nearly irrespectful and insolent. The staff was barking at the guests. I don't recommend this hotel at all and for this awful service I won't pay even 5 dollars per night.,Mari187265
UR95904374,2011-8-February,We had to move out there were so many bed bugs! First we switched rooms and the lady at the front desk didn't seem to care about the bed bugs. The bathroom was awfull too I thought at first I will never shower there! The second room was the same PLUS some creepy little yellow worm like creatures that favored every soft surface of cloth. YEK! Don't go there sleep in the subway or under the bridge this would be cleaner and definitely cosier! ;-),gregjw
UR117773082,2011-6-September,We made a reservation 1 month a go and when we got there the receptionist told us that they had an overbooking and they don't have a room for us he told us that we have to leave! We had no place to go. So we waited for 2 hours in the lobby and they gave us a dirty and messy room! The bathroom was disgusting and the beds were dirty. In the next night there were about 30 people sleeping in the lobby because there were no rooms anymore. The staff was rude and irresponsible. Take a look at the picture in my review that is the ceiling of the bathroom!,CeciliaRinaldi
UR106976040,2011-5-May,This is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. I have stayed in a variety of different hotels all over the world some very basic and some very cheap but none that are as bad as the Carter. The staff were rude offensive and inept. The rooms were disgusting dirty and were not cleaned once. I could go on and on but my only advice to you is to look for another hotel. The fact its close to Time Square doesnt make up for how bad it was. DO NOT STAY HERE.,Cadeirydd
UR91904644,2011-5-January,First of all I would like to say what hotel doesn't even offer wash cloths? I called the lobby for wash cloths and they said they didn't carry them. When we heard we were getting a hotel a half a block from times square we knew it would't be the Westin. We also didn't expect BLACK MOLD in the showers BLOOD on the bed and RATS scratching ALLLL NIGHT.The light fixture was just a light bulb dangling by a couple wires and there was a HUGE hole in the night stand. I called to cancel the second night right after viewing the room. We continued to stay that night and just slept with our clothes on and above the sheets. We all had sinus problems after as well. Everytime we got on the elevator there was someone expressing distress from the hotel carter. There is no way I would stay here again ...I wouldn't even want Obama OR Hugo Chavez staying here.,AshleyVictoriad
UR121431999,2011-5-December,We stayed for 3 days in this hotel because we were travelling on a budget. This hotel is everything the review says a solid 2 star hotel. Hotel Carter gets a perfect rating for its location being steps away from Times Square and close to all other majour attractions. The front desk was relatively friendly and helpful. The four of us stayed at a room with two double beds. There is no fridge no microwave available in the room but they do have a microwave in the lobby the shower was fully functional and the beds were somewhat comfortable. No bed bugs experience thank goodness. There were a few disturbances with really loud guests beside our room which is beyond the hotels control. At one point I found a small cockroach in the bathtub. There is no room service as our phone was not even plugged in and there were no daily room cleanups. There is also no safe. We knew what to expect prior to booking this hotel and got what we paid for. I would not recommend it but it was a suitable hotel for me during my needs at the time.,rockandtravel
UR117679378,2011-4-September,I should have taken photos but it didn't register to me until reading revirws here. Just came back from NY with my husband and son he wanted to see the Statue of Liberty. My husband booked for it what a shock! Never seen any floor so disgusting in my life! We kept our shoes on the entire time. The phone and lamp were so dirty after afew seconds staring at the sight we went back to the lobby  pretty much to ask WTF. Customer service was horrible. Guests who had reservations were shocked to find the place was overboiked their rooms given away! People slept in the lobby - making my issue seem like a priviledge. They need to tear this building down. Learnt my lesson you get what you pay for. Horrible!,Trizah7
UR95478391,2011-4-February,Dont believe reviews with more than one star. Perhaps you may be able to find the needle in a haystack concerning a ok room but this is almost a fantasy. I have never ever in my intire life seen such a filthfy room or missrable. I was horrified. In the corridoor items for firefighting were totally out of order. Inside the room half of the ceiling were hanging in flakes and powdering the floor. Next to the bed were a big hole in the wall covered with a pad containing ratpoisen and it said that you should be at least 5 meters away from it. The aircinditioner didnt fir to the size of the window so all the space round it was plastered with old newspapers. In the bathroom there were big spots with mould. Under the toilet was a hole on 1x1 meter wich went all the way through to the neighbours toilet and actually I was able to se his feets and under legs and of course you could hear everything. The staff is very ignorrant and very very impolite. When we checked in there were thurmult in the reception area so they called a security guard he just advised us not to discuss with the staff and only pay for one night. The same evening we luckily got a room at the Cosmopolitan in Tribeca. So all night long we just sat up in the bed with our clothes on being afraid of bites from all the bed bugs. This hotel should be closed by the healthdepartment in New York City and I just cant understand why this not has happened yet considering Americans view of things like this it is not giving the New York City a very good reputation.,hoffmeier
UR119992851,2011-31-October,pieces of carpet remnants dirty bedding plumbing in bathroom doesn't work. not as bad as it was in the 90's with crack addictsdealers and tv hookers all over. strip joint adjacent to hotel. not a place for kids save your money for a better place.,BigBill24
UR121253309,2011-30-November,A group of us arrived at the hotel at 10pm after a long flight from London. The staff were rude and unhelpful and we were told that the rooms would not be ready for 3 hours. When we eventually got our rooms the rooms were dirty and were not cleaned during the entire stay the paint was peeling of the walls in many places one bed was held up by telephone directories What is believed to have been rat poison was found under one of the beds In one of the rooms there was a large hole in the door to of the toilet where the lock and handle should have been. Avoid this hotel at all costs.,Meilyr
UR117637471,2011-3-September,The good - Location The bad - Leaking toilet filthy bath bed bugs filthy carpet blocked sink It stinks key card that doesn't work half the time the imbecile called Saeed at the front desk. All this for $120/night This is easily the worst hotel I've ever stayed in.,Emp4
UR116207476,2011-3-August,I have business to do i have appointment for 8am so i called to my business partener who is on this hotel but the person who answered the phone barely speaks English and said the computer is not working and he cant find the number of the room. He told me to call in one hour! Imagine my frustationg i cant call in one hour i have to talk with the guest now. They let me in the phone for 20 minuts and never transfered the call to the room. Rude dirty confused unprofessional stay way. You will vomit in this place. Im very sorry that my partner in business got a stay there. Cheap means the worst in town. Zero is to much as credential for them.,Sue1100
UR119873495,2011-29-October,I mean if you are in your right mind do not book a room here rats and mice are in this hotel Here is a list of decent hotels to stay in that are cheap Herald Square Hotel on 31st and between 5th and 6th is good. Portland Square Hotel is good too. These are economical and clean forget the carter no way,mike s
UR110403030,2011-29-May,This hotel is in a total state of disrepair. Sure it's cheap at $100 per night for Time's Square but is it too much to ask for the room to be clean? This was the second time I've stayed at this hotel the first being fine and it was horrible. I stayed in room 1824 and the plaster in the bathroom was peeling off the walls. The hotel being the age it is there could very well be asbestos in the walls. I wouldn't be surprised if some of it was exposed. The tub was full of hair that wasn't mine I found a big crawling around on the floor in the washroom and there was a used condom under the bed. Can't forget about the dirty sheets and towels that weren't soft (this last point being minor). See pictures attached at the end of this review. I talked to "front staff" about all this and what they said was I could switch rooms leave early and get one night refund (still had 2 remaining) or have it cleaned. I was going to switch rooms when housekeeping came by to supposedly clean the room. Well they changed the sheets (which had black stains like grease on them) got rid of the condom and changed the towels. What didn't get cleaned was the hair in the tub - which I thought was judging by the smell of cleaning chemicals in the washroom. I didn't realize till later the tub hadn't been fully cleaned and by then I wasn't going to be there much longer so worked around it. Speaking of front desk staff - the girl who checked me in was a cold hearted [--]. Very rude. All in all not a good experience. PS. They don't have Wi-Fi that reaches up to the rooms. If you want to use you a) have to pay and b) can only use it in the lobby. PPS. I can't forget to mention how noisy it was. The doors are on a spring so they close with a loud bang if people aren't considerate enough to close them gently instead of letting them slam at all hours of the day and night.,cantraveller_11
UR115968218,2011-29-July,This hotel provides the bare minimum to stay for one night. Great location..middle of Time Sq. But the room itself lacks. We found a couple of dirty towels a used bar of soap and shampoo in the bathroom. The a/c worked great but no comforter for the bed...just a sheet. There is no iron or ironing board. No blowdryer. The towels are paper thin. The volume for the tv didn't work on the remote. No hangers in the closet just hooks. However if you plan to only spend time there to sleep at night and get a quick shower it's ok for just one night. I would invest more money and stay somewhere nicer.,God4me
UR106103738,2011-29-April,Okay everyone. Calm down for a second. I booked this hotel a few weeks ago for a last-minute trip to New York without really looking into it much. Once I started reading the reviews I was terrified to stay there but my friend and I decided to give it a go anyway and it's not that bad. Yes the lobby is grimy and some of the staff members are pretty shady looking. The carpet was pretty dirty and disgusting and I wouldn't suggest walking around barefoot. Bring flip flops for the shower or something. Anyway a soon as we entered the room we tore the sheets off the bed and flipped the mattress to look for bed bugs. We didn't find any and neither of us ever had any bites so I have no reason to think that there were bed bugs. We did however buy some cheap blankets at a Walgreens around the corner and we slept with those rather than under the sheets. There are basically zero amenities so if you were expecting the Hilton you should probably stay somewhere else. However not many people I know go to New York City to sit in a hotel room so if you're like us and just need a shower and a place to sleep this will be just fine. I wouldn't want to stay there for a long period of time but for just a few days it served its purpose. If you have a good sense of humor it's actually pretty hilarious. It just added more character to our trip and now we get to say that we survived the dirtiest hotel in America!,Shellbee54
UR94703929,2011-28-January,My friend and I were led here by a man in the bus station offering to find us a hotel...he grabbed our bags in the bus station and started walking so we followed him. Since we had not booked anywhere we took his advice (dumb I know). First he charged us $20 for his "services." We were kinda afraid so we paid him. The woman at the desk also gave him some money and he took off. We paid for our room and went up. It was REVOLTING....there was a cockroach taped to the wall above the headboard the place was DIRTy and the lock on our door did not work. Also the strip club is right beside the "hotel" - classy. My friend refused to stay there the night so we went back to the front desk and asked for our money back. The woman at the desk didn't want to give ANY of our money back but my friend was persistent so she charged us $60 for our ten minute stay. Run away - anywhere is better than that cockroachy scam of a place.,Ilovetrips73
UR94690872,2011-27-January,We stayed at Hotel Carter during a trip for the NYC Marathon. Location and price were the most important things for me at this tripso I was ready for some degree of badness given that we are in NYC. The place is right off Times Square. It is an old old building seemingly never renovated. The bathroom was actually newer but pretty dirty especially the tub. I was aftraid of the infamous New York bed bugsalthough the bedding seemed clean. The bugs never materialized so I think that at least our room didn't have any. No post trip rashes either! The bed was very old and springy but made for a surprisingly good sleep. Bottom line is for New York we got what we paid for. With that said I've stayed at other way more expensive hotels in the city and they were just as old and with small rooms. I guess as someone coming from the Old World I don't care all that much about new and big. But I won't be staying at Hotel Carter again either.,rony_bonbony
UR122140060,2011-27-December,only good location and nothing else....:-) toilets are horrible!,JoÅ¾ica L
UR101625273,2011-26-March,where do I start??? wow the worst hotel on this earrth and should be closed down shocking is a understatement.booked hotel online late as not much avail good price was not expecting the ritz however did not expect this! arrived at hotel to be given 3 room keys and each room we wnt in people were already staying there after four trips to the rude reception girl i asked to speak to the manager. who threw me in the lift and swore at me what a disgusting vile man. the rooms were filthy with millions of locks on the door i would not even get under the covers of the bed as i was afraid what i would find holes in the windows which made rooms freezing cold. taps fell off just disgusting. dont go at all the place is a old knocking shop murders have happened there scary place,081280
UR117295294,2011-26-August,Don't stay here. Don't listen to the reviews that say it is ok. It is not. I have backpacked EuropeAustralia Morocco stayed at youth hostels hotels with shared bathrooms. I am NOT a princess. I have low standards especially for a hotel in NYC that cost $100. If you want to believe the reviews that say it is ok then book it directly through the hotel. That way you are allowed to look at your room and you have 10 minutes to decide if you want your money back. Any hotel that has that as a sign in their lobby tells you something. Unfortunately for us we booked through a 3rd party. (hotels.com) If you can stand the smell of urine in the hallways that make me gag then power to you. I was mostly scared that I would bring bed bugs home with me!!! (I didn't actually see any though),MizMizrahi
UR115764887,2011-25-July,Check-in took just under 5 mins (!!). The room (10th floor) was quite ok: Floor was filthy some dried spew and never hoovered. Bed was cosy with clean sheets. No chair one table. A-C was old but it worked. One working wall socket for power. TV was "model '85" with no remote. Four channels signal breaking all the time. Room was quiet but it faced directly to a big concrete wall (no Manhattan views whatsoever). Bathroom's ceiling was covered with mould. (Could not be healthy) Sink & toilet were clean. Shower was ok with even some hot water! Bathtub was grimy. Hotel staff were friendly check-out took just 30secs luggage room was safe (with $2 extra charge) wi-fi was fast ($25 / week or $10 / day). Wi-fi works only on lobby level. Three fast elevators. There's also 24/7 deli/cafe downstairs where you can buy breakfast lunch beer water... etc. Hamburgers are great! Theres also ATM. Hotel staff can arrange airport transfers city tours etc. Carter's location is also very amazing! This is a good pick IF you get a decent room. Like someone said: Bring your own towel and soap! But remember: this hotel is a true russian roulette every time; With some crazy neighbours cold water and three hour check-in time -> this could be a true hellhole. And one more thing: Do not bring your kids here! I wouldnt.,AlterJohn
UR121005196,2011-24-November,The Carter Hoter 43rd street West NY State Well its no good going on about spilt milk you have probably by now read the other reviews about the Carter Hotel I would like to see the British tourist board fully investigate this place & make the holiday companies who have sold & continue to sell this vermin infested filthy place to us the British public for accomodation purposes pay us every penny back Someone really needs to stop these companies who still promote & sell this this dirty filthy place to us. Please If someone from the tourist board or anyone with powers are reading this then please take time to read the other reviews that have been posted & see the numerous pictures and do something about this place now!! You have to draw a line with what you are prepared to accept & what you get for your money but this place does not appear on the starting block for either. Yes the location was great but that does not detract from the fact of what the hotel actually offered as far has our accomodation was concerned location is not everything in NY and bear in mind not everything is based or built around the square in fact there is actually very little compared to the rest of the city. I have no problem with walking and anyway who intends to spend all their precious holiday time in Times Square anyway? certainly not me I went to NY explore the city & see the wonderfull sights of this city. I did though at least expect the basics from this hotel but did not even get these instead a week of shear hell with utter filth thrown in was what we got instead We never experienced any hot water it was freezing water every single day & every time the toilet was flushed the bathroom flooded with the force of the water hitting the pan there was no heating at all and the temperature was quite cool at night "Thought of putting the extra woolly blanket on the bed that was found in the flthy locker room but thought again & did not bother so we just chivered for a bit" Anyone who is thinking about going to the Carter Hotel in NY state please just do not take my word there are lots more reviews & nightmares out there to read before you actually make up your mind. One thing I would like to say is that I am very suprised about those people who say anything different about this hotel and in turn shout it's praises and to be quite honest if this hotel comes up to your expectations for both personal health & cleanliness then I really would not like to see the places where you may have stayed before. Why have I marked the value as terrible? this is because after already having stayed here & experiencing the nightmare first hand I would not pay them a single cent to stay here again God Bless America & if there is a God up there please help close the Carter right now !!!!!!!,copacabar
UR119622442,2011-23-October,After many years backpacking in Europe staying in almost any lodging available (young hostels rooms w/ shared bstroons bed and breakfast even overnight trains) this is easily one of the worst hotels I ever stay. First of all NYC is much more that Times Square actualy I think locals don't speed that much time here. The hotel is very old and need lots of remodeling. The corridor are dark and have a mold odor. The room has a queen bed no bedbugs bed sheets never change....this was actually better because a don't fill secure and don't want any of the staff on my room. I stay because a friend that live in NYC find this hole for me (thx K) believe you can't find great hotels for the same price at the city just do your homework.,charlierodz
UR109552872,2011-23-May,Beware this is a horrible establishment Staff was not helpful at all about this situation. I will say that New York Police Department has advised me after making my report that they have had several Homicides in this hotel. I was there on vacation with my daughter and i was amazed that a hotel key was used for the entry of my room while we were sleeping They took my purse and all of the contents which left me pennyless 1200 miles from home When I followed up with the manager her said that the security camers was not operational and they were there only for detterrent purposes. If you value your life and your belongings I would pay more and stay somewhere else. No maid service 3 TV channels No hair Dryers No Security And when you have a problem they will not be there to help. Not to mention the restroom in the lobby had a broken door with human feses all over the floor Gross! It is a complete DUMP!,Marshap098
UR114659761,2011-22-June,This hotel was sub-par. I guess you truly get what you pay for. On my next trip to NYC I will pay more to get better quality. I'm sure given the location and low rates this hotel is full every night. The room was more like that of a hostel than a hotel. The staff (particularly one Asian woman working the morning shift) was outwardly rude and not helpful. In addition to her being rude to me she was rude to numerous other customer's and staff in my presence. It wouldn't surprise me at all if she is actually the manager/owner's daughter or some other family member because she spoke to everyone as if she was above reproach. I'd called twice to ensure the check-in time was 1 p.m. because I was moving from one hotel to another. Upon my arrival the woman advised she could not locate my reservation and refused to look any further or reach out to customer service to verify confirmation. I offered to forward my confirmation email to her at the hotel and she refused. I waited for 3 hours and she still wouldn't assist. If I hadn't already been charged the money by the website I would have just found another hotel. In hindsight I wish I had. After three hours of waiting I approached a 2nd shift gentleman that offered to reach out to the reservation center to confirm. Unfortunately the one line that they had was already in use! I ended up calling the reservation center from my cell phone and handing my phone to the second front desk person so he could be told the same confirmation number that I had already been offering them for 3 hours! The same number that was also on the email i'd offered to forward. Upon my entry to the room I was horrified. Unfortunately I was gullible and jet-lagged enough to wait to check into this place! I would never recommend this hotel.,mick0623
UR115654712,2011-22-July,I like many others said "it can't be that bad." we checked in and immediately left the room to visit Time Square. As our plan was don't stay in the room other than to rest. This hotel was horrible and I will be writing the mayor to I form him of the type of service that is representing New York City. When we returned to our room we found a roach and called to request to check out earlier. We were advised that we would not be charged any additional fees. Unfortunately not true. Although my billing concern has nothing to do with the hotel it speaks to the type of service you will receive. The hotel staff was very unprofessional providing false names and nonchalant attitudes toward the guess. I truly was looking forward to posting that this hotel was ok but unfortunately I can not. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone and I am going to recommend to the city to consider Eminent domain as removing this hotel would be beneficial and in the best interest of the city. I am an American and know that New York is better than this hotel but visitors may not.,Travelingmakesmehapy
UR97587018,2011-22-February,I stayed in hotel Carter with my friend. We book hotel because of the location which is right on Times Square. Everything but location is a total joke ! I dont know where to start: rooms are completely dirty we had luck that sheets and pillows where clean carpet is spilled with everything you imagine walls are dirty.. blood stains on the walls windows are totaly damaged all electricity in room is a life hazard bathroom is like from year 1920. When we opened the water it came out completely brown so we brushed our teeth with bottled water all the time. Luckily we managed to look on the bright side and concider all this as a joke as we just slept there. I cant understand how come that this kind of a hotel is still open they bribed an inspection i dont know???? PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM THIS HOTEL!!!,damjanh
UR120861703,2011-21-November,not only did i get sent to a room that was already occupied--very embarassing - but when i returned to the desk ( carrying luggage and all) i was greeted rudely. My next room had no heat no phone to call the front desk ( what if emergency ??) and when i went to close the drapes the whole thing metal rod and all fell down on my head. When i did complain to front desk they were again rude. I was given the wrong email for the manager .I am a nyer who had to stay in the city for one night and needed to fly out early the next AM- calling from out of town the following day i was told this manager Erwin Lumanglas would only handle complaints in person and i needed to fly back- so meet with him! I said obviously most people who stay in hotels don't live local and that would never work --i was told the manager would never call me --ever-- he just doesn't -- this was stated by a female desk clerk whose name was supposedly Larry- another lie!,sue r
UR120836457,2011-20-November,This hotel is a real disaster!! When you arrive to the hotel the lobby looks amazing. However the reality starts when the elevator arrives to the room floors. The carper is very dirty. The door of the room looks like it was made more than 50 years ago and it has never been remodeled. The worse part starts when you get into the room. The carpet is even worse than the hallway ones. The walls have a lot of mold around all the bedroom and the bathroom. The sheets and the towels are dirty too. They include something like coffee stains.The toilet was leaking so the bathroom seems like a pool. I can't believe that a hotel like this continues operating in this horrible condition.,maria r
UR115589504,2011-20-July,Gross hotel. I read the reviews but thought a hotel cannot be THAT bad. It was. Actually worse than I could ever imagine. Location is great but that's about the only good thing. No remote dirty carpet unclean bath towels and blanket...room had a musty odor. We complained to manager and he said "if you want a nice hotel the Westin is down the block "...take my advice..spend a few extra dollars for something actually HALF decent.,rix611
UR104719632,2011-20-April,Read this carefully: I am type of customer who does not consider reviews so much. I like to see things with my eyes. As i did not care much about reviews on hotels.com i booked a room. First room was horrible. they didn't even change the sheets. We requested a new room. It was even worser. No lights no portable light were available. Blood on the sheet bedbugs carpets are 80 years old. It was extremely dirty. Restroom was horrible (i saw a human dirt on the wall). Also there is only one person is working to clean and help anything with room. He was okay with attitude but there was no janitors. Overall: it is such a hotel which build to make money until it collapse lol :) I will report them to health deparment and consumer affairs. Got my money back from hotels.com ( special thanks to them).,NevadaJames009
UR116188136,2011-2-August,WORST hotel I have ever stayed at in my life! If I could give it less than one star I WOULD. Cheap price SEEMS good online BUT -- staff was - unnecessarily - rude and charged us whatever price they wanted when we got to the hotel despite prices given online. Rooms were disturbingly old with no attempts to fix it up whatsoever Carpets were extremely dirty with doors that didn't close properly unless forced closed. No hot water bathroom had barely any space to move. REALLY strange and random smell in the room... TV was really old with only a few channels and kept going out every 5 minutes - get up to go to the bathroom and cable/satellite would go out. Only plus is it's very close to Times Square if you're a fan... otherwise stay further out at another hotel and cab in for shows/tourist attractions.,bailey1138
UR114406651,2011-19-June,Having toured america for a month we hadn't stayed in the nicest of places however The Carter Hotel was by far the worst in America. We were only staying at the carter for one night and we weren't looking for anything amazing we thought cheap room no worries we won't be spending that much time in there. We were greeted by rude staff who complimented on our appearances as 'rough' and 'hungover' so automatically we weren't really felt welcome reached the floor were our room was and automatically though we were in a horror film or a brothel. Got into our 'triple room' to find two double beds one with blood stains and the other which looked like stains from a couple who got lucky the night before. There were no towels or toiletries and the floor looked like it hadn't had a proper clean in years. We asked to be moved rooms as we weren't happy and our next room appeared better however we soon found hairs in the plug hole stains on the toilet bowel and stains on the bed. Luckily we had friends staying in New York so we decided to check out straight away purely for hygiene reasons once explaining that we wanted to check out we received from the front of house members a smirk and a laugh no sorry or refund. We approximately stayed in that hotel less than an hour. All round worst hotel experience EVER.,petermaidenhead
UR120761826,2011-18-November,I am so glad I read these reviews but I am so disgusted right now to think that any city would allow such a business to operate and how the state doesn't shut down this public health risk I mean this is a real safety issue and there needs to be a class action law suite and if someone had the time they should consider being courageous enough to help out in this matter this hotel makes enough profit to renovate and to think that NYC is allowing these greedy slumlords operate such a pighole is beyond my comprehension just because it's in a convenient location. Mayor Bloomberg is a billionaire and could afford to have a lawsuit thrown at him it just takes 1 person to do some leg work with finding a good criminal lawyer to fight the greed and disgust as we see fit at this Hotel Carter,Aquarius2012
UR108785755,2011-18-May,Wow is all I have to say. Their photos make it appear "do-able". This is NOT the case. If you want to feel like you are staying in a an impoverish drug hotel then stay here. I've stayed at inn's in 3rd world countries...that are literallly better than this. I didn't even open my suitcase. Slept in my clothes and checked out as soon as the sun came up. Your first warning should be the sign at the check in that say "A refund will be issued for guest who stayed less than 10 minutes in the room. Otherwise one night charge will apply" So in otherwords they have so many people that see the room then want to leave...that they had to impose a "10 minute rule".,jenbarker
UR114124826,2011-18-June,Really one of the grossest placest I've ever stayed at. It has "won" the dirtiest hotel award on Tripadvisor for 4 years in a row and they try really hard to win again. The location is amazing so is any bridge in the Central Park though. Comfort would be the same. It is extremely cheap (compared to the average price per night in Manhattan). This pretty much summed up the two pros that I had to keep telling myself every night before I had to convince myself to enter the room. Everything else is really just disgusting: The rooms have a disgusting smell that won't go away. There were hairs of different colors and sizes (if thats of different guests or different hair of one guest - I dont want to know) on our sheets and in the bath room. Im not even gonna start listing the ridiculous charges for Internet (which is only available in the lobby) or even for storing the luggage. Btw walk the 50m and enjoy free Wifi at Times Square. Another interesting fact to the right of the elevators (after the corner) there are flat screen TVs (probably the only ones in the entire hotel) where any guest can watch the live hidden security cameras of the hallways and elevators. Quite funny to see what people do in the elevators when they think nobody sees them and great activity if you need to pass time in the lobby. Not so funny if you are one of those people being watched. To sum it up: Don't go here!! (I know you won't be scared because the price is unbeatable). .,LeonTLV
UR115469157,2011-18-July,Honestly guys you who turned away when you saw the room did you ever wonder why this downtown hotel was so cheap comparing to other in central Manhattan before you book?! This hotel is only for travellers who intend to be out of the room throught their stay in NY nothing more nothing less. A/C worked sheets were adequately clean (brought mine anyway after reading so many bad reviews about blood stains hairs and monsters with big teeth coming through the curtains). I stayed for two nights and was going to the room only to have a shower and sleep for a few hours (I was so tired in the end of the day - and night- so the mattress felt softer than my own bed). Next time you moan about the paint on the walls think what you are asked to pay and how close you are to everywhere in the most expensive city of the world.,RebusGirl
UR116903565,2011-18-August,Worst hotel i've ever been! Everything was dirty and old. Bed bugs stains everywhere. You don't want to sleep here! When we came in there were used tissues everywhere around the room. Toothbrushes and empty bottles under the bed. They haven't cleaned here for weeks/months/years.,djowie
UR118243700,2011-17-September,Stayed here 9th - 15th Sept with my daughter. Our flight had been delayed for over 2hrs so when we arrived to check in I was shocked to be told that if we had been much laterour room would have been let to someone else. Don't know how they can do this if you have already paid for you room. The reception staff are polite and friendly but as for the hotel it is serious need of updating. I know they say you get what you pay for... but I am sure you are entitled to a clean room the only thing clean in my room was the sheets. The rest was filthy I took my own sheets and towels with me after reading reviewsglad I did as the towels are not that great. I also took bathroom wipes with me that is a must as the rooms are not cleaned thoughout the stay. Another bit of advice take coat hangers as there is no storage in the room we had a walk in closet but due to the state of it we would not hang our clothes in it. Also flip flops are good as the carpets are very dirty... We had no hot water throughout our stay only luke warm. I Know they are refurbishing at the moment and that some rooms have been done so maybe thay are cleaner. but as for our ROOM no 700... If given this room ask for a refurbished ONE you might strike LUCKY,cludasdulac
UR115434731,2011-17-July,I think the title says it all. When I got into the room the thick glass mirror on the back of the bathroom door was cracked (like someone punched it) and the bathroom was barely big enough to turn around in. There was some slight mold on the shower but nothing too awful until I laid down in bed and noticed a reddish brown stain on the wall. Then another. Then another. Three rather large blood stains on the wall. Needless to say I didn't sleep well that night. I stayed here as part of a college trip for a class I was in and none of my fellow classmate's rooms were any better.,MyFireInside4
UR120682761,2011-16-November,I was looking for an inexpensive hotel to spent one night in and boy did I get what I paid for. This place is dingy filthy dirty and creepy as hell! Upon entering my "room" the first thing I see is a scetch of a penis on the wall the door jam was hanging off and there was no heat. Other than making the beds the houskeeping in this hotel do nothing at all. The room was dusty the bathroom was ok but the bathtub was disgusting! I reported it to the front desk and I was told that the cleaning staff goes home at 5pm and they didn't know what to tell me. There was a decent view on the "terrace" but that too was dirty and full of cigarette butts. I wouldn't stay at this hotel again if they gave me the room for free. Save yourself the trouble.,J-A-M-40CT
UR108534474,2011-16-May,This place was disgusting. The room was filthy no toilet paper no bath towels. When we called the front desk they were rude and said we would have to come down to get toilet paper. Never did get any towels. Slept fully clothed on top of the bed spread don't think they know what clean linen is. Only thing going for this place is the location would never stay here again or recommend anyone to stay here.,jtb1956
UR96812320,2011-16-February,The worst hotel Id ever been. I went with my wife and simply cannot believe it. The only positive I remember is that the room is so nasty that it simply invites you to walk everywhere else in NYC and avoid spending any time back in your room!!! They charge you in advance so you got to be back at least not to waste your money. I had been in awful places in Mexico and in some other locations in Central and South America but NOTHING as this hotel...a once in a lifetime experience....,Alizama
UR113642898,2011-15-June,A $5000-per-room renovation is not enough for this hotel. The walls and doors were all just painted over even the wires were painted into the wall. The king size bed is in the way of everything that you don't have space to move around the room. You don't know whether the toilet's clean or not because it still looks dirty after being cleaned. I've been to old buildings that have been successfully turned into hotels and Carter Hotel will have to do a better job of renovating for its guests to be able to say that they have really renovated. Suggestion to hotel: get smaller beds or break down a few walls to convert 3 rooms into 2. The staff while friendly can't say anything else but 'just doing their jobs'. If you're on a budget don't get a room in the Times Square area. If it has to be Times Square and you can spend a little over twice more than Carter's rate on a room get at least a 4-star room.,FarmerOfTheDell
UR119312108,2011-14-October,I stayed here with 2 of my girl friends for 2 weeks. When we checked in they gave us a tiny room with 2 double beds when we booked the triple room which is meant to have a king bed and double.. we went back downstairs to complain and the man tried to tell us a triple room was 2 double beds when on the website it clearly says 1 king and 1 double. eventually he gave up and gave us the room we paid for. Also I bought a new pair of shoes and wore them once then left them near the door of the room and when we came back to our room one of the shoes were missing. We couldn't figure out how it could of gone missing until we saw the cleaners change our sheets. They pulled the sheets off the beds and threw them on the ground then scooped them up from the ground without a care of anything that could of been underneath them. I ask the front desk to speak to the laundry stuff to find my shoes but he said he would find out and call my room. he never called. I asked front desk 4 more times to find out about my shoe but no ones helped me or bothered to get back to me. I got frustrated and asked if i could just talk to someone from laundry myself. but the front desk said they can't speak English. Besides this terrible experience the hotel was in a great location and worth what we paid. Just a shame the staff is so terrible.,Shannonerae
UR120595264,2011-14-November,We have to give this hotel 10/10 for location but it was the scruffiest hotel we have stayed in. The beds were at a forty five degree angle paintwork chipping and we had no hot water in the morning or evening (we came back at 3pm to get a shower). It was very depressing to stay in but we did find our room clean even though the bed covers were threadbear. The worst were the holes between the air-con and the metal plates which let cold air into the room. It may have been cheap for NY but I resented the money we did pay for such a run down hotel.,jane q
UR119247266,2011-13-October,I booked this hotel and was impressed with the location and price so was determined to accept that it would be basic but acceptable. What I was not prepared for was the number of bed bug bites I with which I awoke in the morning. Check in was satisfactory and the room was simple and very basic but functional. The bathroom was OK however the bed was uncomfortable. I received a large number of bites from bed bugs that took a number of days to clear. DON"T STAY HERE!!!!!!,paul1967sydney
UR120543191,2011-13-November,Extremely filthy! Never mind 'you get what you pay for' - when you book a 'basic hotel' you expect clean and basic so expecting it to be like a 'travel lodge' we booked into this hotel. We were directed to our first room which was absolutely filthy. We complained and was found a 2nd room - this wasn't even made up dirty bedsheets on the floor filthy walls etc. We complained again. Our 3rd room was also awful. As we were staying only 2 nights we decided to put up with it. We didn't get undressed for bed or take a shower it was all too grimey. The bedspread had huge stains on it and had an awful smell. We asked for it to be changed. We were given another one more or less the same. The staff were rude and didn't care less about very unhappy customers who were lining up to change rooms. Disgusting hotel - never ever again! Please steer clear!!!,Lynda H

UR103714771,2011-12-April,Hotel is a total disaster no hot water no toilets (or damaged/dirty) looks like a slums no cleaning... it's like a 3rd world....,Akukaracza
UR112752719,2011-11-June,DO NOT STAY HERE!!! my boyfriend and I figured we just wanted a place to crash at night since we would be out visiting family and friends. Yet one deserves a clean decent place to sleep. We knew we were in trouble when we stepped out the elevator to on our floor. The smell of urine was everywhere. The room left little to be desire. The AC did not work the carpet was burgundy and one could still see ALL the dirt on it. The bathroom was ok but bring your own towels. The ones provided are at least 20 years old hard and linty. No guards on the windows so be mindful if you bring children. The cheap price about $120/night was NOT worth it. Go accross the bridge to Jersey and commute into the city the shuttle bus is only $2. STAY AWAY FROM CARTER!!!,bori8183
UR112608269,2011-10-June,In 30 years of business travel this was by far the worst hotel I have ever stayed at. My regular hotels were all booked and so this was my first and (ond only) time at the Carter. I thought that based on location near Times Square that it would meet a minimum standard of hotels in the area. It did not come close. The room was aweful. Brown walls no artwork or anything on the walls except a dirty/foggy mirorr. There was no soap shampoo hangers iron or ironing board. No glasses for water no coffee no desk 1 lousy chair that had to be used for luggage stand. I called the front desk to have an iron and ironing board sent up and was told I'd be "put on the waiting list." Unbelievable! I waited an hour and then I ended up buying an iron at a nearby pharmacy. No internet except in lobby and that was extra $10 per day. Never any space to work in lobby at any time. All seats for interent were always taken. Furniture was decrepit. Not fit to be sold at a junk sale. The room was not vacuumed. I stayed 2 nights and they never made up the room or replaced towels / sheets. The sink leaved onto the bathroom floor. Avoid this place at all costs. It is no bargain.,PKFRAM
UR118804391,2011-1-October,We were in Carter Hotel during 7th-11th of September 2011 and before going there we read all the rewiews here and were a little scared.. But the hotel was not bad but not luxory either. Clean sheets towels hot water from the shower no bed bugs... Old fashioned tv but so what we didnt came here to watch tv!!! Everything worked well check in and check out cleaner came once what is fine for so short stayig. Location perfect!! We are a normal working class couple aged 36 and recommend this for couples who love to travel and see different places like us!! Would definitely go threre again!!,ninza1974
UR121305120,2011-1-December,The location is Excellent. It's located just a few minutes away from the heart of Times Square. However the uncleanliness poor conditions of the hotel being given 5 different rooms only to end up in the worst one of them all the sheer rudeness of the manager on duty and the fact that we were given a room that was already occupied by a half naked man all equal...Never Again!!! The pictures below are just some of the pictures taken from "unfortunate adventure" at Hotel Carter. I understand that it's a cheap hotel and like I stated at the beginning of this review...the location is Excellent but the hotel and the lack of customer service by the manager on duty need to be revamped..completely. Just because it's a cheap hotel doesn't mean I as a consumer should expect anything less than a clean safe room without having to have switched rooms 5 times. I will never travel to this hotel ever again...even if they were paying me to review it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! If someone were to ask me where's the worst place to stay in NYC...this would be at the very top of my list!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,NotImpressedAtAll_11
UR58001656,2010-8-March,This hotel has an interesting history in NYC from a hostel to brothel to being used by the city as low cost housing the Carter has been around for a long time. The hotel is old and dirt but the things that actually count were ok. I checked the bed and it had clean sheet like they had just come from the laundry the bathtub and toilet were both clean altho they were old. Looks like the bathroom had a little work done so that was ok. The TV had horrible cable reception the phone did not work and carpets were disgusting. For me as long as the bed and bathroom are clean and im safe I dont care. If you are in NYC your not going to watch that much TV anyway. I have a cell phone so who cares if the phone didnt work. Overall if you are on a tight tight budget and want a clean bed and bathroom this is it. However the carpets are dirty history of the hotel is a bit scary and the room itself is old. Would I recommend it to finds NO. I would recommend it to those who are on a budget... I might stay there again. The staff was nice and the security guy makes sure nothing but guests enter the room are that made me feel good.,franciscomorales
UR89373785,2010-8-December,Ok so first keep in mind that this is the cheapest hotel in Times Square. Ever. Ranging from 100$-150$ this is incredible. Most hotels are 400$ and + for one night. I'd rather spend my money somewhere else. Carter Hotel has two qualities : cheap and located 1 minute away from the center of Times Square and subway stations. That's it. On the other side you'll find very basic accomodations. It's old dirty and it smells. The ceiling was leaking in the lobby and the odor was terrible. What a good start! The rooms are from the 60's and the carpet was cleaned late in the 90's. The toilet has blood stains and the bath was really dirty. Put your sandals on if you take a shower! Bring your towels too. No remote for the tv and I could hear people having a good time in Times Square. You'll hear taxis ambulances police and people all night long! Terrible. Bed sheets were okay although they smelled like old cigarettes... My advice wake up early in the morning spend 15-18 hours in NYC explore Manhattan and the surroundings then crash in your bed exhausted... then do the same the next day. Don't expect a romantic journey room service or a good movie while laying in bed!,jeffquesnel
UR74356985,2010-8-August,Now we have done everything! The doorman looked like a ghoul......the carpets were filthy we should have known. Our room had 3 different pieces of carpeting (stained and dirty) bathroom was beyond imagination - showered with a towel in the bath. The sheets were clean but the mattress was stained......... makes you think?? The staff have probably heard so many complaints that they just could not care! The smoke detector was in a drawer with no batteries - how can the "authorities" allow these people to continue running this flea pit! We did not see any "bugs" but rooms smelled strongly of insecticide. Awful!,Dot58
UR82491735,2010-7-October,My friend and I stayed at the Carter for a week. Next time we visit the city we are staying further away from Times Square. It is very very noisy and too many people!! The hotel is very old and should be torn down. There is a smell that about knocks you down upon entering. The only good thing was the shower worked well and we did have a new mattress. We only got 4 channels on the old tv and our carpet was kid themed with bright balloons!! Also it was super cold and there wasn't a heater. We are just thankful there were no bed bugs!!! I would definitely not stay here with children.,jodeci8
UR86129407,2010-6-November,I was absolutely mortified when we walked into our room. There was water damage on the walls a single light bulb hanging from the ceiling. It was totally unacceptable. A dirty towel was hanging in the bathroom which the door didn't lock. No soap or wash cloths. When we called down to ask for some the staff told us they provide beds and baths. Creepy. Really creepy. The phone was on the floor and the tv looked like it was from the seventies. This place is totally gross and should be condemned.,nycguysque
UR81575157,2010-30-September,Appreciate you get what you pay for but this place really doesn't justify paying anything. Judging by the photos online they are gradually renovating (in the loosest sense) however the room we got was akin to a very poor hostel at best. Room was dirty and the bathroom clearly hadn't been cleaned properly for years. Lights were broken AC didn't work properly and the room was so noisy getting any sleep was difficult. We pre-booked seven nights and bailed after one. If you absolutely have to save the pennies I'm sure you can get better for about the same (some of NYC's hostels have decent enough reputations). If you can stretch your budget a bit then I would definately do so. This place isn't worth the risk or apparent saving.,Steve123456789012
UR69256477,2010-30-June,Speaking as someone who works in the resort/hotel business in Virginia Beach I was very skeptical when my mother booked this hotel for a fun family get away for my sister's graduation present. We purposely booked Friday night because we were due to arrive around 6am on Saturday and wanted to get right in and sleep for a bit before being tourists. When we checked in not only did the lobby smell of mold and mildew but the hotel had sold our room that we had already paid for. The man at the front desk had the nerve to tell me the he wouldnt charge me for last night even though he SOLD our room that we had strategically booked! That was not the worst of it. The elevator does not work like modern elevators because the floor buttons are merely call buttons for the elevator. If you are on the third floor and want to go down and the elevator is going up to the 10th floor it will stop on your floor even though you dont wish to go upward. Once we got up to our room there was nothing on the bed but one sheet and a pillow with no case! In addition to that the stains in the bathroom tub/toilet no toilet paper no light fixtures over the lights wet urine stains on the carpet small animal droppings and the AC was in the window but there was no outlet to plug it into anywhere! So I guess the AC was just for show? There is a sign in the lobby that says if you spend more than 10 min in your room then you cannot get a refund and if there is a sign like that then you know that it is bad!! Please I am saying out of the kindness of my heart as well as my knowledge of good/bad in the hotel business do not waste your money because of the allure of the proximity to Times Square and the cheap price. It is NOT worth a trip to the ER for something nasty.,HokieHeather
UR91107598,2010-30-December,We chose this hotel for the cost and the location we expected budget we knew there would be no kettle and cups we knew there would be no complimentry toiletries we knew there would be scuff marks on the walls maybe a paint job needing and a few fix me ups here and there we never expected maid service or a fridge a microwave or mini bar...... what we did expect was decent basic cleanliness and sanitisation and to be able to sleep without the fear of catching a disease!!!!! Basic cleanliness is LAW in the USA I believe... I also believe there are Sanitisation Guidelines regarding MICE in your food and luggage!!!! We DID NOT EXPECT THE PLAZA before any of you start raving about "BUDGET BUDGET BUDGET" but we ALSO DID NOT EXPECT MICE!!!!!!! We had been there 2 nights and while it wasn't the cleanest of places we were grinning and bearing it as the cost and location were Ideal.... on the 2nd night we came back to find that all our sons powdered food had been eaten by mice and that mouse droppings were all over our clothes and in our luggage even in my daughters backpack with her pens and pencils!!! My 4 year old daughter ended up in NYU Hospital for a day as she had severe Gastric and was being sick continuously!!! After finding the mouse droppings we washed everything out packed our belongings and I spent an hour searching for another Hotel which we found a few streets away at only a little bit more per night than the Carter! I would not recommend this hotel to your DOG let alone any human there are probably hostels in better cleanliness than this place it is unacceptable by any standard and ANYONE who thinks that its budget and you get what you pay for should think about what they are actually getting crawling all over them when they are asleep!!!!!!!!!!!! Budget = Basic No Frills Carter = Squaler dirty & free mice to soil your food and clothes!!!! Stay at your own risk!! This place should come with a serious health warning and I will be writing to the NYC Sanitation Dept!,DebbieBrianHales
UR59860001,2010-29-March,The hotel is in a great location and I did not see any bugs in the room and the sheets did appear to be clean but that is it. Dirty floors - no one went without shoes no outlets no washcloths for the bathroom no bath mats no hangers in the closet very small room with 2 beds and an old nightstand between them a TV that had very poor picture quality and only had a few chanels no lamp - just a light bulb hanging from the ceiling doors with 3 different locks that slammed shut. Did not expect much at $100 a night but did hope for more than what I got. Was told at check in that I was given one of the "nicer" rooms.,LucindaWV
UR54683085,2010-29-January,Stayed at the Carter one night. I couldn't possibly subject my wife and myself to a second. The room was in tatters the bathroom pathetic with faucets leaking provusely and no towles (we had to ask for some) curtains torn overhead light fixture non existent except a bulb and...the bed bug that bit me that night left me a present on my belly that lasted six months before it healed! When I went down to complain to the manager the following morning the stoned-faced Asian woman - supposedly the manager - did not speak one word. She just looked at me. Furious English tourists received the same treatment. We are shocked that the New York health department leaves properties like these to represent their city by taking no action to close them down!,eagle1GrandLedge
UR77420544,2010-29-August,Worse Hotel in NYC the area is not bad at all but the service was really bad. Please avoid this hell hotel it is filthy dirty it smell so bad the room didn't even look like the pictures they have to view the rooms there was no towels hair dryer or ironing board in the room and the TV only had one channel. It was a nightmare we only stayed one night thank god.,Keyla24k
UR88414327,2010-28-November,This was just the worst ever. The rooms were just absolutely abhorrent. Here's the list: 1) There was just one electrical outlet. 2) There was one light in the room and one bulb was broke. Oh and it was only a 50 Watt bulb. 3) The carpet looks like it had not been vacuumed in years. 4) The rooms were never cleaned in 4 days of stay. 5) The bathrooms did not have curtains. 6) The bathrooms had mildew. 7) The tub was kept clogging. 8) No remote control for the TV. 9) There was no cancellation policy. After reserving the room on the Amex that was it. 10) The staff looked like they were trying to the best with what they could but still.....,NyManny123
UR81250074,2010-27-September,As I read this should be the worst place I ever been. And that is saying a lot for me I stayed in the cheapest places in all south america but never like this at least there I knew what to expect and the people there would never call that a Hotel. I made a big mistake trusting a persons recommendation (i would never do that again). Be smart (not as I did) trust this reviews is better to be a little further that spend the night in this let's say hotel.,gabyko
UR81081482,2010-26-September,This has got to be the worst place I've ever stayed in. I was depressed walking in there. The "hotel" as they call it was a mess. We stayed there 9/21 through the 9/23 the room was NOT cleaned durning our stay. It was like a flop house. HATED this so called hotel and would NEVER be back or recommend people stay completely away from here!!! I should have listened to the reviews. It was dirty and the halls smelled. Someone in the elevator told me that was roach spray. The place was HELL! STAY AWAY!!!!!,vbaez2
UR59617546,2010-26-March,if you want to know anything about this hotel just watch this video and you'll get a good idea of what it would be like. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgBE1L8_WUs&feature=related,thecrunkbabe
UR84828890,2010-25-October,First of all I knew I was not going to a top notch hotel. I needed a relatively inexpensive place to stay for a long weekend and the Hotel Carter was one of the few I found that I could afford. On the positive side my sheets were clean I had hot water and the place did not have bedbugs. Where do I begin with the negatives? The room looked like it hadn't been renovated in 40 years. My overhead light fixture was little more than a bare bulb hanging from the ceiling. The bathroom wall had a gaping hole behind the door. The sink was cracked. The comforter had "suspect" stains on it. The TV worked sometimes. If you are only looking for a bed to crash and don't plan to spend much time in the room go for it. But be warned that it's a dump.,JoeCamel199
UR84671760,2010-24-October,This "hotel" is so dirty. We found a mouse in one of our bags and rats in the room - twice! Fungus on the bathroom walls. The room was only cleaned (cleaned - ha!) two or three times during our 10 day stay. Had there been any rooms vacant at a affordable hotel somewhere else in NYC we would have checked out immediately! The hotel staff is a joke. This is a cheap hotel so surely you can't expect luxurybut this place is totally unacceptable. Someone call the authorities!,Marshady
UR71994206,2010-23-July,Why you should stay away..... bugs on the walls & ceilings in the rooms. what appeared to be menstrual stains on the beds.... either that or trace evidence left over from some horrific crime scene housekeeping (if they actually exist but I dont think they do) forgot to put sheets on one of the beds and when we called the front desk to try to remedy this they didn't speak english,Nessacery
UR84237954,2010-20-October,we walked in and walked right out of the room it was filthy moldy and the furniture was falling in on its self. we were then told we would get a full refund and 4 days later receive notice that they were not refunding the money because we had stayed there and that even if we didn't they were still charging us. Had to dispute it through our credit card. The Cheetah club is next door and I an sure that is where they get most of their business by the hour DO NOT EVEN THINK OF BOOKING,MrsScope
UR88869875,2010-2-December,i cried real tears when i first saw our room on the 11th floor. it was like something from a horror move but the hotel staff changed it for us quickly to one on the 18th floor . the new room was VERY basic and not very clean. However the sheets were clean and we didnt get bitten by bed bugs which was my worst fear. would never stay again!!,roamingjode
UR83878714,2010-17-October,My sisters and I visited this past weekend for my sister's 30th bday. Although I completely understand what some reviewers are saying when they say "you get what you pay for" it doesn't mean that the hotel shouldn't comply with all health and safety codes and standards. The room was absolutely disgusting and I wouldn't suggest it to anyone not even my worse enemy. The bathroom looked as though if I blew on it it would fall into pieces. I've never seen that much dirt and grime in my entire life. We were unable to take showers and we all slept in our clothes and slept with our bags on the bed to avoid possible critters. We requested heat and was informed that management wouldn't turn it on so we were freezing as well. We met someone on the elevator that informed us that she had mice in her room and requested to be moved or her money back and was denied. This place needs to be burned down immediately. Location is great like everyone stated but I think the hotel would do so much better with updated basic needs. Not fire hazards and asbestos!!!,Shanna416
UR64173003,2010-14-May,Location for the price you can't get any better that Hotel Carter I booked my hotel last minute so at that time the only other hotels near Times Square were over $300 which my friends refused to chip in for although I was willing to spend that much. We endedup paying about $115 a night for 3 adults. You are super close to the subway system and the Circle Line Boat Tours and of course Times Square. As far as the room I found hair that wasn't mine drawers that couldnt open no tv remote bed with only flat sheet no bottom (so basically sleeping on mattress) were told by front desk no more bath towels available a dirty maids cleaning rag in the corner broken shower curtain hair and bobbie pins that weren't mine (not my hair color & I didnt have hair pins) my other two companions were male so I knew it was from a previous guest. Front desk kinda had that snotty attitude but no biggie....as I work as a front desk girl here in Hawaii. What did I expect aloha spirit? No hello I was in New York....I wasn't gonna let anything get me down. I LOVED MY TRIP and will be back but more than likely wont be staying at Carter unless they fully renovate the rooms. We made friends with the nice Chinese doorman and the Filipino Bellman they were the nicest people in the whole property!! So bottom line location location for NYC and this is great for that but as as far as the room kinda yucky and I can put up with alot I was raised in a old plantation house with lil money and this took me back to my childhood....not so great. I can see why some people run away with disgust but hey I get what I pay for right?!!,alohagirly
UR70960055,2010-14-July,Even after reading the reviews I decided to give Hotel Carter a try because we wanted to stay in Times Square and couldn't afford an expensive hotel. BIG MISTAKE. The front desk staff was unfriendly and very curt. When we arrived on our floor the smell in the hallways was terrible (and no air conditioning in the halls). We entered our room to find: peeling paint on the walls and ceiling broken furniture filthy carpets that were stained and not vacuumed windows that were dirty both inside and out nails sticking in the walls fire alarm hanging from the ceiling a painted bathtub that was peeling and dirty and a live cockroach in the bathroom. When we complained about the cockroach the desk clerk laughed but did agree to move us to a "better" room. It was only slightly better because there were no roaches but still had peeling paint water damage in the bathroom no closet TV that was old and virtually unwatchable. We left after one night and will never return. BEWARE - when you check in your credit card is immediately billed for the entire reservation. If you leave they will eventually issue you a refund if you check out by their deadline. Although the location was good it was not worth the discomfort and disgusting accommodations. For a few dollars more check out the Comfort Inn.,debfidel
UR74988127,2010-13-August,This place is so bad I'm surprised that the mice and roaches that crawl across your sheets during the middle of the night haven't found a better place to call home.,obiland
UR70578005,2010-12-July,I have stay there for shopping in New York. The price related to the adress of the hotel it was ok. The carter hotel is 2 minutes from Times square. The room was not ok. The floor was dirty and the bath ugly. anyway the bed was clean so this was the important. if you have ask the reception you receive everyday clean bed and blanket...If you are really the hole day go shopping and only sleep few hours in the hotel it is ok.,Leyla_79
UR53260523,2010-12-January,I stayed at Hotel Carter last year for 3 nights. I made the mistake of booking a room before I had read the reviews. I spent hours reading reviews and I was simply terrified. Since I had already paid for the room I only hoped my room will be in the upper floors (most of the people were complaining of the smell in the lobby). When we arrived late at night the lobby was packed with Asian tourists. The woman at the reception desk gave me the room key without saying anything. I asked my boyfriend to wait in the lobby with the suitcases so I can go and check how bad the room is (I also knew from the reviews that people were changing rooms until they find something acceptable). I was surprised to find out that the room was not that bad. The sheets looked cleaned (I used the pillow case I brought just in case) the TV was working and most importantly there was hot water. For the location and price the place is not as bad as described. Its bearable. It depends how high your standards are.,StellaJinx
UR83048716,2010-11-October,My family and I stayed at the Carter from October 5th-October 8 2010. Location is awesome but there was mold on the shower curtain and we had to make several trips to the front desk for towels. Maid service is every three days. The room did not smell bad but it looked like something from a 3rd world county. And I do not mean a resort in a 3rd world country. If you go remember to bring your own towels and shampoo/soap. I would also buy Clorox and poor in the bath tub to kill the mold before you bathe.,marthagp
UR86673360,2010-10-November,This hotel or crack den as we nicknamed it was so far beyond awful awful was a dot! We went for NYE and as it was a late booking choices for accommodation were low. We got out of the taxi walked into the lobby and had to laugh (or we'd of cried). Think 70's decoration at it's worst - neon lights flower pattern carpet and a wall full of old tvs. As the lift doors opened to the 18th floor the first thing you saw was an exposed pipe and multiple holes in the dirty carpet. A quick list of issues: 1. Pubic hair EVERYWHERE. On the telephone in the button on the tv the bathroom walls (to name a few) 2. Unvacuumed room 3. No clean towels 4. No one cleaned the room or changed sheets for the 7 days we stayed 5. Mould on the sheet 6. Missing draws 7. Leak in the ceiling 8. Hole in the bathroom tiles We laughed the whole first night as the whole situation was like nothing we had ever experienced. The first thing we had to do was buy cleaning products - not that it made a difference. The carpets were that dirty I refused to walk on the floor without shoes on - choosing to jump from bed to bed or bed to draws. Flip flops were also worn in the shower as the thought of standing in the bath made my skin crawl.,USplease
UR77866896,2010-1-September,Apparently the hotels in New York don't have to comply with ANY health codes! This was the dirtiest most disgusting hotel room I've ever seen. I don't know where to even begin. No towels... we had to go to the desk and ask for them the carpet looked like the last time it was vacuumed was 1972 the day it was installed there were two beds that looked like they came straight from a flea market the walls were bare paint peeled the one outlet in the room not counting the one in the bathroom had one usable plug as the other was blocked by an exposed water pipe (nice) one light bulb hanging from the ceiling (the compact fluorescent bulb was a nice touch) the bathtub was full of dirty black stuff (I don't care to know what) the closet was stinky and disgusting and I was sure I would have crabs bed bugs or both by the time we left! They should be ashamed! This place needs to be condemned!,smilindog
UR46303801,2009-8-October,This Hotel has to be the bottom of the list. No housekeeping under a 4 day stay. No room service no extra towels 4 working tv stations mold all over the rest room nasty front desk people. Drafts from the window frames and Internet that is free in the lobby which doesn't work and be careful sitting on the sofas in the lobby you can crack your back since the wood frame is the cushion. Oh and all you hear at night is the topless bar near the lobby of the hotel if your below floor 8. In short  STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE.,mauihowie
UR37049679,2009-8-August,The Hotel I had actually booked didn't get my reservation in so I had to find a "cheap" hotel in NY fast! After a day of searching I found the Hotel Carter. It seemed to be all I was looking for: theatre district cheap internet access... The lobby actually looked really nice so I didn't really see it coming... When I checked in the next day I immediately knew I would be checking out again the next day. The Concierge showed me and my suitcases up to my room. The elevator was small and weird smelling. The hallways were really narrow and uneven and dirty looking. While walking the halls I could hear other people "do it" in the other rooms. The room itself was empty... one big room with a big bed with white sheets white bare walls and a small brown dresser. There was a really old small TV that had like 3 TV channels... The connecting bathroom was tiny and didn't look very clean to me either. a lot of the tiles on the floor and walls were broken and the only outlets in the room were in the bathroom which I wasn't even able to use since they were kinda pushed into the wall. So to use my blowdryer I had to unplug the TV. I just felt uncomfortable there. That night I spent as much time outside as possible and when I got tired I put my ipod on really loud before entering the elevator and started to sing along to the song while walking the hall. I also had the feeling that I HAD TO lock the door and use the deadbolt. If you really don't care where you're sleeping this is THE hotel for you since its location is perfect (around the corner from times square). But be prepared for no comfort at all untidy rooms and halls and a lot of things you really don't wanna hear out of other rooms.,EndlessFighter
UR23342620,2009-7-January,Do NOT go here. A kind warning. Im not going to go into more detail but we had bed bugs crawling all over us within the first hour of our afternoon nap. The bed bugs infested my luggage and now two weeks later I have a bed bug infestation in my own flat back home! An Austrian couple had been moved to their third room and the guy had bites in his whole face. Management's answer to the problem: "Thats what you get for living so cheaply just next to times square" and "There is nothing we can do about it". We checked out the same day we checked in. The Chinese woman managing was rude and did not seem to care ONE bit about the problem all she wanted was to make money.,andreas_denmark
UR29395865,2009-5-May,Trip advisors rated it as #1 to be the worst in US!! We had cockroaches and Bed bugs in the room.The lobby is decorated with Neon lights and has a funky old smell.During our compaint in the front desk.We witness hookers comming in and out from the building.I would never even think of recommending this place to my worst enemy.The man in the front desk was rude and didnt even want to step inside the room.He said he doesnt want to bring the bed bugs in his own home.This place totally ruined my trip in NYC . I know better next time to always check on trip advisor. Why has the new york health Dept havent shut this down? WIth the N1H1 (swine)flu going onthis is the worst place to go to and is not worth a penny. The store beside the hotel is extremely expensive. I washed and disinfected my whole luggage as soon as i got home in toronto.Stay away from Hotel Carter!,alex123467
UR25666462,2009-5-March,Sucks big time. If you want to stay alive DO NOT go.,BonBonman
UR29326556,2009-4-May,This is an appauling hotel. The electricity sockets are on the blink the decor is awful and the beds are unconfortable (I could feel every spring). You know you are not the first to find it so bad that you want to leave by the notice on Reception saying "no refunds after you have been in your room for more than 15 minutes". The location is good but the hotel desparately needs some money spent on it. The Ladies contained graffiti (see picture) "this hotel is crap". We visited in April 09 but the graffiti which clearly had been there in 2008 was still there!,sitdeus
UR25595057,2009-4-March,Stayed in Carter Hotel (not sure if it should be classed as a hotel) for 2 nights. The location was great you are within walking distance of a lot of the major sights & shops. The hotel was awful very run downdirty & smelly.The greasy restaurant next door did little to help. Didnt give a lot of time in the room as I had sights to see & shopping to do so I suppose the cost of the room did somewhat compensate for the awful condition it was in & the location was great. Health & Safety could seriously do with checking up on the Carter. I am surprised it is still open.,ddqueen
UR23246803,2009-4-January,The Absolute worst hotel in my history of hotel stays. I have stayed in many hotels mainly Westins Marriots Sheratons Hiltons many like those. But this one takes the cake. The place advertised cheap renovated rooms private baths and so on. But they forget to mention they are filthy and grotesque!!! The place itself is located right next door to a gentlemens club where strippers hang around outside all day. As soon as you enter you see neon lights and cheap old chairs. The men at the door who greet you are the only good thing about it. The woman at the front desk was rude and inconsiderate. She first told us we couldn't go up to our rooms yet because it was about an hour before check in. So we demanded and got our key. We should have just turned back when she said it was too early. But they don't give refunds AT ALL. So we get on the elevator poor excuse for one anyway when we get off it looks like one of those bad films shot in the worst neighborhoods of NY. The hallways are barely big enough for two people to walk close to each other the paint is chipped or gone the floors are horrible the lighting is scary and the door was aweful. Looked as if I could break it down without much effort. So we get into the room and we all drop our mouths. YUCK! Two double beds so close to each other there is practically no room to walk in between. Carpet that hasn't been cleaned in over 7 years Curtains which looks like I bought it from a man standing OUTSIDE of the dollar store and the bed and "comforter" are so old your completely grosed out. The sheets looked as if they were washed recently but the rest of the place was so disgusting that you didnt even want to take off your shoes let alone sleep on the bed. And the bathroom!!! WOW the bathtub is one of those that were painted so all the paint was off or chipped and the toilet was the same. Someone had actually used the bathroom (Number 2) right before we got there. GROSS! We stayed the night since we pretty much didnt have a choice. After a long day of shopping and eating we kind of didnt care anymore since we were stuck and it was only for one night. But then at night UGH! There was this loud noise that sounded at first like someone screaming then later we figured out that it wasn't but we still don't know that it definitely wasnt. I offered to pay for a stay at the Sheraton but we decided to stick it out. The next day we all had to use flip flops to shower with and threw them away after no one wanted to touch those things let alone bring them back home. And when we checked out it was the same RUDE woman. And they wouldnt even let us hold our bags there until actual checkout time since we got up early to shop some more. OVERALL WORST HOTEL EVVVVVEEEERRRR!!! DONT I REPEAT DON'T EVER STAY HERE. IT'S NOT WORTH ANY AMOUNT OF MONEY. PAY THAT EXTRA AMOUNT AND STAY SOMEWHERE ANYWHERE ELSE!!! PLEASE!!!! I WISH WE TOOK PICTURES BECAUSE THE PICTURES THEY HAVE OF THIS HOTEL MUST HAVE BEEN WHEN IT OPENED. SO DECEIVING!!!,cvbabygurl617
UR36196937,2009-30-July,This hotel was disgusting. My friend and I stayed here because it was cheap and we wanted to spend money in NYC on things other than a hotel. There was no air conditioning and creepy men in the lobby. The hallway smelled awful when we went to our room. Our room was dirty and I refused to touch anything. My friend and I decided we just weren't going to use the shower because there were stains all over in it. We only stayed one night. The door to our room had a flimsy lock. The comforter was stained. The carpet was stained. The air conditioner didn't really work. The room smelled like paint and the bathroom door wouldn't even shut because there was so much paint on it. Why would they need to paint so much - makes you wonder what they were covering up...The hotel "security" guard let anyone into the lobby. We saw a homeless people just waltzing in. Nice security... Please do not stay at this hotel for your own health and safety. I researched the hotel when I got home and found out that a little while back a dead body was found in the hotel underneath a bed cut up in bags. Yikes.,Twilightstar10
UR33845641,2009-3-July,Yes we read some of the terrible reviews of Hotel Carter before our trip and like many others we decided it couldn't be that bad we were only using the room for sleeping right? The man at the front desk was friendly enough when we checked in we got our room key right away and headed up to the fourth floor. The damp mouldy smell in the hallway should have been our first clue but we were optimistic. When we saw our room I was very disapointed to say the least. "No frills" just doesn't describe it the basic ammenities were just not up to the most minimal of standards. The carpet was so dirty I couldn't take my shoes off and the extremely thin bed spread had so many stains on it that I didn't want to sit down. The light above the bed was missing a lamp shade which we could have tolerated if the sound of water running out of the bathroom tap in a solid stream and the beeping of the smoke alarm weren't already testing our nerves. The water in the toilet was brown and when we tried to flush it even more brown water came up. We immediately asked the front desk for another room to which we were told they were very busy and there were no other rooms available but he would send someone up to fix the tap. When someone came 10 minutes later to fix the tap he took one look at the room and said "You guys didn't get a very good room I'll be right back" and left. 2 minutes later the room phone rang and the man at the front desk apologized for the room and asked us to come get our new room key. If a hotel employee didn't even want to stay in the room for 5 minutes to fix a tap what hope did we have??? Our second room on the fifth floor was an improvement with clear water in the toilet sink and shower however there was no hot water at any time during our two day stay. The new bedspread was still very thin and stained but atleast the sheets were clean and the bed was fairly comfortable. The air conditioner did work well but created a very distracting smell. We were able to open one window to air the room out but there was no screen. The bathroom door had so many coats of paint on it that it couldn't close. We weren't able to connect to any free wireless Internet on our laptop either. Both of our windows faced brick buildings so we never got to see the "great views". Bottom line yes the hotel is right in the heart of Times Square which is great but spending anymore than a few minutes awake in your room will just kill your excitement for the city! Next time we stay in NYC we will spend a little more money or walk a little further. It's just not worth it. If nothing else bring your own pillow some flip flops to walk around your room in and your own blankets!,Lets_go_26
UR23223299,2009-3-January,I am very frugual and I read all the bad reviews so I have no one to blame but myself. I thought to myself that even if it's really bad it's just a roof over my head and I'll be in the city all day. It's just to sleep at night. I have to say this is by far the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. It should be shut down by the board of health. I was spared but my friend got a rash even though we brought our own sleeping bags. The bathroom made me want to vomit. And I am by no means a clean freak - far from it. But when you see the tiles blackened with mold it's pretty disgusting. On a good note: We didn't see any cockroaches:-) I will never stay there again. Not even if they offered me a free room.,alysha781
UR50585817,2009-3-December,i should've known to leave when the guy ahead of me was trying to rent a room without an i.d. this dude made mohammed atta look like mr. rogers. though the clerk denied his entry i still believe it was because i was there as a witness to it. the room was worse than a being in a mexican laundromat with a toothache. there was no art no nightstand four channels no remote no view no breeze a broken a/c and a stench that reminded me of being inside an ashtray stuck inside a fat woman's shoe. i will never ever even walk by this place again. do not even with an uzi to your head stay here.,steveturnerx
UR33336865,2009-28-June,This was the absolute worst place I've ever been in. You walk in and the front entrance wreaks of oil the employees don't speak English the lobby is connected to something like a gentlemens club the elevators don't function properly... I could go on and on... on our level the hallways were very poorly lit it was dark and disgusting like something you'd only be able to see in a horror film. The trash cans near there were torn apart as if someone went scavenging for food. Our hotel room was a cramped 2 bed bedroom the decor didn't match at all our curtains were made from sheets with soccer balls on them. The bathroom door didn't shut there was no running water it was FILTHY. We had one outlet plug in the whole place. There was a large dresser blocking of the use of 2 closets with missing doorknobs... I don't even want to know why they would be blocked off. This hotel is the worst of the worst I wouldn't stay here again for free. We spent 3 nights here and on the last night my Dad's sheets fell off his bed exposing blood on his box spring. When we got home I looked up the hotel history and check it out for yourself there's no way that that won't change you mind about staying here... there've been deaths and murders and trouble of every kind. We made a 'crime scene' project for class and somewhat cheating we used a story of the prostitute who was cut in to pieces and placed in trash bags under the bed... using photos from the trip to recreate the room perfectly and we won best in class. The convenience of this place isn't worth your safety. Stay somewhere else please.,KatieBrady
UR23972307,2009-28-January,My husband and I needed to visit the city on a day hotel availability was scarce. We usually stay at 2.5 -3 star hotels in Manhattan (for example Holiday Inn and Hilton Garden Inn). Unfortunately all hotels ranging from $175 - $350 per night were booked that evening. Thus we had a choice between $130 for a one star and $350 for a 3.5 star hotel. The HOTEL CARTER was SO DISGUSTING we left at 8 pm without checking out. Though we're courteous people we didn't bother to do so as we had prepaid anyway and the lobby was littered with the following: a jumpy looking street hood making a rather obvious drug transaction and a sadly young prostitute whose infectious state was apparent from the lesions on her face. We ended up at the Marriott (the lowest price available room spur of the moment) charging on our credit card $380 for a box-like room. We're not at all wealthy -- are middle class parents of college aged kids living frugally. However we ended up spending over $500 that night for the two hotels because the small mountain of bugs in our room noshing on on some previous client's piece of banana in the garbage (yes -- they were red-tinted and appeared to be blood suckers)  the brown-stained bed cover (it looked as if someone with uncontrolled diarhhea had sat on the bed previously) and the rat racing in the hall outside had us thinking we'd need medical attention the next day if we stayed. Please don't stay here.........perhaps if they lack clientele they'll shut down. Honestly even if my husband and I were homeless we'd prefer to sleep in Port Authority than here.,Scubapal
UR25307120,2009-28-February,We were a party of nine staying in four rooms 4-8 Dec 08. Reservations were made online from Denmark. No problems checking in. The staff is friendly probably unless you act as if you expected a four star hotel. One of the assigned rooms was not made up (we arrived noon) and another assigned immediately. In one room the toilet wouldn't flush; but it was fixed the same afternoon. All rooms were very worn down the carpet scruffy the walls bare and the bathtub surface repaired with paint. But the sheets and towels were clean and there was plenty of hot water in the shower. None of us experienced bed bugs but a mouse appeared in the bathtub in one of the rooms - no harm done. In one room the window couldn't close completely so the room got quite cold (PJs and sock are recommended). There is free wireless Internet access in the lobby. If you look past the scruffiness you can in fact see some of the thirties charm the hotel once had. The entrance suffers from odors from the (overpriced) grease-joint next door The hotel is 1/2 block (200 meters) from Times Square - all said! The location/price-ratio can't be beat and we had 6-700$ more to spend on shopping per day we stayed! Regard your stay in the hotel as you would a camping trip with regard to comfort and facilities keep your expectations down be friendly to the staff and spend your time and money in the City.,DalleJensen
UR45026614,2009-27-September,Hotel Carter in Times Square is a great place to rent a low cost room for an hour or two. The girls in the 'Cheetah' lobby bar are always willing to party with you back in your room. The girls are all beautiful and range in age from 16 to 28 They are mostly foreign tourists and illegal aliens from Eastern Europe working for cash tips. Hotel management can not legally say that the rooms are for rent by the hour. So the flat rate room rent will actually cover you until checkout time of 10:00 AM. The room rent is negotiable and you can expect to pay $50 to $100 which is a bargain by midtown Manhattan standards,XL4U
UR23963068,2009-27-January,STAY AWAY!!!! This place is the worst hotel in the world! It makes a crack house look like a Hilton. There are mice roachesBed Bugsand crack heads all living at this Hell Hole! The hotel itself smells and is filthy from the disgusting bedspread to the filthy bathroom. Just stay away!!!!,jerseyguy10
UR25245091,2009-27-February,Our only requirement for a room in NYC was cleanliness not amenities. Our first room had vomit still on the wall. The 2nd room we were given had a chair that was broken and dark brown (actual color green) from grime and filth. The bedspread was filthy. We slept in our clothes. We saw fire hazards of old wires patched with duct tape. We should have reported this place to the fire department and health department.,ydujg
UR26855356,2009-26-March,Honestly I hated New York city because of this hotel! I remembered the movie derailed stay away from this place! Pennsylvania hotel same or similar rate way better,Javier_Castegnaro
UR23911385,2009-26-January,Please just stay away from this Hotel its like a HORROR movie in reallife its so bad that its just not for real Barack Obama please shut it down! ;) We went for a new Hotel The Pod excellent small rooms but great value for money,qbrick32
UR25068217,2009-24-February,we stayed at the carter hotel because the price seemed reasonable $140.00 not cheap but reasonable and the location was great i should have suspected somthing when i asked to see the room before we paid we were told that was not hotel policy it was late afternoon so we decided to go ahead and book one night the room was totally smelly the bed was surprisingly good but we itched all night ( bedbugs) nothing worked the hall way reeked of smoke couldnt wait to get out of their the next morning wouldnt recomend this hotel to anyone it should be closed down,snoopi48
UR47428550,2009-21-October,The front desk person was polite but did nothing about our disgusting nasty carpet. Our TV only played 4 channels. It was a broken down hotel making it by disguising itself in the heart of Manhattan. The pictures definitely doesn't represent this hotel. This was the worst hotel I have EVER been in. I wouldn't recommend this hotel.,hdmassage
UR32842678,2009-21-June,Trying to check in to this hotel was pretty difficult since none of the staff had ever heard a Scottish accent apparently and they were running 700 rooms on paper - no computer! The room was disgusting with tiles smashed on the shower floor and stained sheets. Had to check in again the next night as our key stopped working. While waiting in the reception full of impatient and disappointed patrons a body bag was pulled out of the elevator and news teams were streaming into the lobby. One word - AVOID!,FJGuitar
UR23744840,2009-21-January,* Rodent infested * Telephone in room didn't work * Room not made on a daily basis * Ceiling leaked * Bathroom door didn't shut properly * Built up hair clogged shower drain * Wall socket powerpoints were ancient & plugs would fall out of them,Gresch
UR24892144,2009-21-February,I should have known that when I got a hotel in Manhattan for 100 a night that it would be a nasty bug infested experience! The downstairs bathroom in the lobby has graffiti that says "if you want an STD stay here!" It was the worst experience of my life and I ended up checking out that night and promply calling EVERY hotel in the city to find better accomodations. I ended up at the crowne plaza for 450 and it was worth EVERY penny! Do not stay in this place if your life depends on it. I wouldnt reccomend this hotel to my worst enemy of fear that they may die with some horrible disease.,rent69me
UR38406946,2009-21-August,I can't imagine why they would even term this place a hotel. It's just a room with an attached bathroom. There are just too many disgusting things to enumerate about this place. 1) The bathrooms were filthy. 2) The bathtub had terrible stains 3) The bath towels - ugh - don't even get me started 4) The carpets look as if they've never been vacuumed 5) They had a threadbare excuse for a blanket & filthy sheets 6) The T.V had just one channel 7) There was no remote And this after changing rooms! And all this for $ 100 a night - UNIMAGINABLY BAD!!!! And 100 bucks just for the location I have stayed in way cleaner student hostels for a quarter of the cost in Chelsea in Manhattan! PS: I also think there were hookers waiting around inside the hotel in the evening!,SheenaK
UR23177954,2009-2-January,It was the Obama and The McCann Election We arrived at the hotel not looking for perfection.. Floor 21 room long dark corridor room at the end... no place to stay alone always bring a friend.. We were tired we had had a long flight on checking in our senses were not aware of our plight five minutes in the room we began to sense the gloom the hotel was a hellhole cockroaches mice rats bedbugs that could eat your soul drug barons and women of the night it was a scary moviefull of fright we spent some dollars to stay in the hotel full of horrors.. The hotel should be called "at your own peril" where you can meet a girl or a rat named sheryl if you want to tell a story for years to come stay in this hotel of hundrum we stayed five nights that says a lot we shared a room with a rat and we tolerated the grot only because we did not want to waste precious time we were in NY a city sublime... but we now have learnt you must read the reviews to avoid the hotel carter and avoid the blues for the ones who say its ok... it really is not if you want to enjoy New York... this is Not the Place to Plot!,HappySueUk
UR47146763,2009-18-October,one of the inexpensives hotel in new york. no glamor and kind of onfresh. i get bedbugs bites over my hole body.,NiklasP
UR23677097,2009-18-January,i went away for my 19 birthday last weekend and booked the hotel online. arriving i was greeted by the men working there hitting on me and my best friend. then the elevator door wouldnt shut...we get upstairs and the walls are filthy the room had a cockroach in the sink and the sheets were gross. the hallway had hairballs like tumbleweeds in a desert the man at the front desk was rude and tried giving us two other rooms before us leaving then he would not fax over a paper to the website we booked on saying we had arrived so we could get our money back he tried denying we came. all in all we got our money and stayed at another clean hotel. this place was filthy!!!!!!,jilliie0x
UR51312377,2009-15-December,the personnel was helpful & friendly. towels were soft & plentiful. beds (we had 2 rooms-and stayed 4 nights) were comfortable and the sheets & pillowcases were clean. shower was good and the water was always hot. price was also great. location is PERFECT near everything. adjoining deli--sandwiches were yummy. would I stay there again? ABSOLUTELY!! however and this is a HUGE HOWEVER I highly recommend you bring a wash cloth or two and slippers as I do not believe it was vacuumed in a very long long long LONG TIME. and bring a plastic cup. also even though toilet was forceful it leaked every time we flushed so we put a towel behind it. and bring flip flops or water shoes for your shower as the bathtub needs a cleaning. our bathtub wasn't too bad but the other gals had mold along the wall to which one gal said she was worried about Legionnaires disease. and our TV didn't work but actually we didn't seem to miss it. and the only electrical outlet that worked (besides the air-conditioner one) was the one in the bathroom but that was a little loose so we had to prop up some boxes of crackers on top of a suitcase to plug in our cell phone chargers. we found this to be very humorous. the outlets & TV worked in the other room. "they" even had a picture on their wall ours was behind the dresser. and my point to all of this is: great price GREAT LOCATION and if ever we go again you can bet that we will stay at the Carter Hotel. we had a fantastic time and at the end of the day a comfortable bed to lay our heads with no aching back in the morning. just needs some TLC and a REALLY GOOD CLEANING.,chickqueene
UR37753673,2009-15-August,I can only assume the they have a relative or "client" who runs the New York City Health Department. It is almost unimaginable that one could find a single hotel bad enough to reflect so very poorly on the largest city in the US but there you have it. That this place is still in business (which must include something other than Hospitality) makes one distrust everything that is New York! Suffice it to say we would not even use the shower or sit on the toilet. God only knows what made those animal sounds in the middle of the night.,beauTexas
UR46767860,2009-13-October,We were worried about the hotel because of the terrible reviews yet a friend went there and found that it wasn't bad. So we took a chance not expecting much. The location was outstanding steps away from Times Square and the theatre district. The bed was firm the sheets were clean and the front desk staff was pleasant. The lobby was old and shabby but reasonable . The elevator worked. Everything else was absolutely terrible. We had to laugh when we entered our rooms. A single bare lighbulb hung from the ceiling with remanents of what had been a lighting fixture. We were told we had an updated room. I guest that meant that the bulb was a compact flourescent rather than the old fashioned bulb. The two dressers and tv stand were broken and barely standing the telephone didn't work the carpet was filthy and had some gooey stuff in it. The bathroom was clean but the attempt to cover the mould with white paint wasn't successful. There was a leak somewhere and the floor had puddles of water that never dried up so we had to wear our crocks to keep our feet dry. It was the worst room I had ever been in including my travels on the "$5.00 a day guide" of 30 years ago. But I had been warned. What bothered me most was the attitude of the hotel. I've been to some old and shabby motels but the staff at least try to be accommodating. Like others have said there is no maid service the rooms are not cleaned during your stay towels and bedding isn't changed. There was debris in the hallway which had not been cleaned in the four days we stayed there. There is no interest on the hotel's part to do repairs or proper cleaning. At $139 a night you should expect some cleaning and basic maintenance to be done. While we didn't encounter the horrors that others suffered I can believe those who have dealt with bugs rashes dirty sheets and worse. We put it in proper perspective - it was no worse than tent camping in the dirt but with running water (that wouldn't stop running),travelmench
UR24490591,2009-12-February,I wouldn't bother staying at Hotel Carter even if you paid me. My safety and health are worth much more than any price! Having inspected hotels all over the world for American Airlines for over a 15 year period I've seen my share of what a budget room should look like. I wouldn't expect anything other than a comfortable and clean room! But if I had to worry about bed bugs black mold umpteen safety and electrical codes not up to standard I would gladly stay elsewhere even if the price was higher and I would even consider sleeping outside with the homeless for a cardboard box must be safer than this place. This VirtualTourist.com review says Hotel Carter is 'free from infestation'. I would beg to differ as most of their reviews stated. AOL just yesterday did a front page expose on this property calling it the worst hotel in America. Wikipedia says it has been voted the filthiest hotel in America for FOUR consecutive years. You can read all about the hotel history here. wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel_Carter_Manhattan If words do not convey enough just take a peek if you dare at the 263 candid tourist photo's taken and posted in a picture gallery shown right here on the tripadvisor.com website. www.tripadvisor.com/LocationPhotos-g60763-d93421-Hotel_Carter-New_York_City_New_York.html Someone once said a photo says a thousand words. I wonder what 263 photo's say? I would hope the city of New York would want this eyesore torn down. Perhaps at one time this was a respectable hotel. But that was then and this is now. Considering this hotel was used as a homeless shelter sometime during the 1970-80's I would think that once turned back into a hotel some serious money and consideration would be the main priority for the proper renovations and updates to safety codes be made. I guess not. I am just glad in my many years in the travel industry I never booked a room there for any of my clientele. If they wanted such a budget property I would have suggested an area YMCA or a hostel over this hotel in a heartbeat. I don't wish this hotel on my worst enemy....Ok enough ranting. People educate yourself as much as possible when booking your own trips. Listen to what others have to say. Budget is budget - do not expect pools spa's and restaurants. But expect a clean and comfortable atmosphere certainly not a place where dead mice are laying on the floor black mold surrounds you in the shower and beds infested with bedbugs as you will awaken with a bad rash all over you. Save this place for the quickie-prostitutes and their clients as this is who the hotel really caters to. You can't compare this budget property with others as it is like comparing apples and oranges. These are the wisest words I can give to anyone considering this hotel and I've inspected hotels for 20 years.,vudubabz
UR49009066,2009-11-November,Google dirstiest hotels in america and this one wins. Hope you have fun but i think your taking a big chance. I was thinking of hotel pennisavan but it was rated # 2. I think i can afford this city.,snltickets

UR40724473,2009-10-September,I honestly cannot fault this place for its location. That said the place was atrocious it was very unclean and the service was non-existant the lifts kept sticking when I complaned the staff suddenly decided they couldnt speak English (although they could when they were taking my money!!) We decided on this place for somwhere to get our heads down for the night but woke up feeling itchy and dirty. Again that said its cheap and cheerful but do not expect The Ritz or the Hilton you WILL be disappointed trust me! MP-UK,pipkins-uk
UR25360375,2009-1-March,Horrible hotel filthy room furniture broken smelly room and lobby saw room and went down to desk to leave they wouldn't give us our money back! Said we checked in...how can you check into a rat trap? The price you have listed is ridiculous should be 29 bucks even that's not worth it! Plus there is some sort of pimpy-looking guy in the lobby at a desk (i found out this hotel is a former brothel) A nice man told us to go to the Milford Plaza Hotel we got a great deal we told them what happened to us (we were there to see the Macy's Parade and they were very gracious and the Milford was fabulous!,gailslist
UR21673365,2008-9-November,We stayed on the 4th floor and were very relieved to be there and not the 17th as the place is a fire hazard and my husband had a getaway organised out the window if such a catclysmic event occurred. there are water sprinklers but with everything else very mickey mouse have doubts these would work. The bed was good and I am fussy if it wasnt I was off around the corner to the Best western and so was the shower the room wasnt cleaned once in 3 days and rubbish sat outside the lift for all the time we were there. The room was quite big with a disgusting outlook a wall ok I accept that in NY but several stubbed out cigarette stubs outside the window and a whole lot of coke cans and rubbish on the roof I dont there were dirty cotton buds behind the toilet. The smoke alarm was constantly blinging so asked to have it fixed before we went out for the day by the lady in the middle of the foyer who gave me a short shift as if to say what is your problem!!!! 6 hours later nothing had been done so asked again so the batteries were removed after they moved the dressing table for the front doorman to stand on to reach it. No batteries were replaced but wait for it  because of time change and exhausted we were sound asleep at 10pm someone knocked on the door 2 days later to replace the batteries  and were of course wanting to move the dressing table to stand on . We declined and said we would put it in the next day. HOT water well this interesting they turn it off to save money I guess I wanted a shower at 7am and it was freezing so rang downstairs every morning between 7 and 8 am and they would say 10 mins and it will be warm. the third morning I rang down and was told to run the tap for 15 mins and then it will be warm in this day and age can anyone believe that you waste water for 15 mins x 700 rooms it doesnt bear thinking about. There are serious problems with the management here there is a lady in the foyer has an air of expecting complaints all day as she collects the money but seriously you would have to have psychological problems to have to endure this day in and day out. When one just counts the money and doesnt do anything to the hotel this is sacriledge the hotel was packed in Oct 08 for the weekend with young travellers Its position is sensational my attitude was we were only sleeping there and having a shower which was good pressure albeit cool to warm to hot at about 9am. One good thing was that we arrived at midday we got a room immediately which was a plus.,2kiwisathamptoncourt
UR17726423,2008-9-July,7 of us stayed for 5 nights in 3 rooms on the 12th floor.Sheets were clean but not changed while we were there.Bathroom and shower in 1230 were hot and clean.Only 2 small towels were supplied.Walls need painting and new carpets would be nice but at least the tv and air-conditioning worked. You get what you pay for and it was the cheapest we could find when we were booking. We did'nt see any bugs or roachesor rats or mice. If you want a cheap place to sleep in New York right next to Times Square and Broadway then the Carter is ok but only just.,joe_publicManchester
UR12459159,2008-9-January,On our first trip to New York we booked this hotel directly from their web site. When telling the cab driver at JFK where we were staying he instructed us not to leave anything in our rooms. (bad start!) On arrival at the hotel at about 7pm there were 3 prostitutes standing outside. Nevertheless we checked in and went up to our room. The hotel decor is a throw back from the 70s with graffitti on the lobby and corridor walls. On getting to our room we immdeiately noticed the 4 locks on the back of the door (why on earth would we need 4 - worrying!) On inspection the room was dirty the sheets were not fresh and there was obvious evidence of vermin. It was on entering the bathroom when we decided to leave due to a filthy toilet and a dirty pair of ladies briefs hanging on the wall. At this point my girlfriend was in tears and I went down to reception to ask for my money back. They tried to fob me off with another room which I looked at but was equally as bad. When returning to reception I demanded my money back and in fairness to them they refunded the amount. We ended up paying 250 per night to stay at the 5* Westin Hotel next door but boy was it worth it as when we told them about the Carter they upgraded us to a suite free of charge. Please take my advice and do not stay at this hotel.,Tory126
UR22588023,2008-9-December,I own a Bed and Breakfast. and you cannot show pictures on the web site that are from the time your buisness was restored 25 years ago??? The rooms are not even close to being that nice. eat cheaper and spend more on a nicer hotel. you will thank me. Its sad because this hotel could be a swing nice 40s style hotel that would be hot to go to. Could some one buy it and restore it. I feel it is worth it. Its in a prime location.,Hallplace
UR14903074,2008-9-April,This "hotel" is the worst experience I have ever had. We made a reservation in advance and when we got to the hotel the reservation was not found. We were charged for the price of a suite but we got some singe bed room. We were three guests.... The room was not cleaned it had used sheets... When our key didin't work it took an hour to get someone upstairs to open the door. This person could not open the door either except after knocking at the door.... I don't know what was the deal with that because the key suddenly worked perfectly after the "knock".,Boosteri
UR21640445,2008-8-November,First of all the website we booked with is Lastminutetravel.com. If you check out their website the pics they have of the Carter Hotel show a nice clean room small but with actual furniture and a lamp and headboards on the beds. We went to NYC for my girlfriends 40th birthday. We wanted a clean place to get dressed and crash for a few hours before driving home the next day. We booked this hotel in September on-line. I cannot believe that the City of New York actually lets this hotel operate. It would have been cleaner to stay on a bench in the subway station or on the floor of a public bathroom. I cannot imagine that this hotel is getting away with renting rooms. There must be some codes that the city enforces. I have filed several complaints with the building inspector and will be notifying the Board of Health. This hotel has safety issues and cleanliness issues that need to be addressed. The Carter Hotel should have been condemnd years ago and I will write to anyone that I can to see to it that the place gets shut down asap. Tourists are putting themselves at high risk if they stay there. What has this world come to that a hotel like the Carter Hotel can every day of the year rip off unsuspecting tourists and ruin their New York experience. Owners of the Carter Hotel should be ashamed of themselves and Last Minute Travel.com should be ashamed of themselves for falsely representing this absolutely horrendous place!!!!!!!!!,thebadone69
UR20702931,2008-7-October,The only good thing about the hotel is that it is right in Time Square. T he rooms are filthy and old and there is no maid service. So no matter how long is your stay your towels will not be changed and your bed will not be made. You will be lucky if at the reception they remember to explain you how to get warm water for your shower (a stupid combination of turning on the tap in the sink and the shower at the same time). The price is ridiculously high if you think what you get... Terrible place.,Sonia_Garcia
UR14860048,2008-7-April,Absolutely the worst place I have ever stayed in my life. My girlfriend bought me tickets to see a yankees game and it was my first time ever in NYC so I wanted to stay the night and do some shopping along with the game. We looked at the Hotel Carter website and the room looked nice. I didn't bother reading reviews because I just didn't feel the need. I wish I would have. The only nice thing about the place was the doorman who was polite and nice everytime. We entered our room....1704. And the bed was made and looked clean. The sheet had a greasy looking stain on it when inspected at close range. The bathroom sink was constantly dripping which was annoying I got in the shower right when we got there so we could go out and do some site seeing and shopping and noticed some long black hairs on the wall. Looked behind me and realized that they nicely left me the bar soap from the last person who stayed there. I looked above and in the vent above the shower there was tissues sticking out of it who knows why and I wasn't about to take them down and find out. My girlfriend and I made a complete joke of the place normally right away I would complain but we just wanted to enjoy the day and I decided that I would complain later that night when we came back. When we came back I told the guy at the desk nicely about the problems. He had nothing to say other than "oh Shi*" you tell me earlier i change you room....he then told me to talk to the manager in the morning. So we woke up and we left and did some more shopping I came back to check out and complain. HAA what a joke! The chinese lady acted like it was no big deal and wouldnt even listen to my complaints. Just before this a lady with her family told us they had to be moved from a room on the 8th floor to the 17th floor because of a rat in their room the night before. All in all. Avoid the place. Yes price is great and location even better but its not worth the filth and they don't care about the place let alone their customers. It was an experience and I have found myself laughing at the reviews now that I'm back home in my clean apartment. The placed should be condemned and shut down.,jt3315
UR19824270,2008-6-September,This hotel is the worse hotel I ever saw. I have been travelling even in a third world country but this Carter hotel is really one of its kind. The carpet was so dirty and dusty the toilet door is not closing the towels were stained and doesn't smells good the tub is very dirty overall the smell of the room is terrible. It's a smell that tells you that the room hasn't been cleaned for a while and i got a lot of bites and itchs. The time we arrived in the hotel we were assigned our room and as soon we entered our room we complained because it was so dirty and the whole room smells like a the smell of the toilet so they gave us another room. ALSO staffs are not accommodating and never listened to your complaints. It seems that they are all brain-dead. All you can hear from them is you get for what you paid. And don't be ever fooled or mislead with the room ammenities provided in their website. There is no hairdyer the remote of the TV is not working (no batteries) and the telephone in not working. For the three days that we stayed there the sheets were never change even if you keep on putting the sign "Maid Service" in your door. Good we brought with us a couple of sheets and pillow cases and wipes. So guys don't bother to put this signs in your door it won't work. And bring wipes with you to clean the place as what we did at least it will helps. I never recommend these hotel to my friends and hoping that the management will do something about this. They should not sacrifice hygiene for everyone. I hope the Health Ministry also finds time to inspect this hotel. Except for the LOCATION nothing is good in this hotel. .,kapanalig97
UR15702299,2008-6-May,I'd read the reviews on this site prior to booking so was kind of expecting what I got. I got a last minute cheap flight to NYC for the bank hols and was travelling alone so thought I'd look at budget end of market to save money for shopping! Only other centrally placed hotels with availability were 3 x price and hostels were pretty full so plumped for the Carter. This is a very budget hotel stress on the "very". Check in was so-so staff not very helpful or friendly but not too problematic. I had a double room with own bathroom but both the room and bathroom were very dirty. There were 2 very used and wet towels left in the bath when I got there (and remained there through my stay) and the sink was filthy. Carpet looked like it had never had a hoover near it. Single lightbulb swinging from ceiling and window about 6ft from another wall so no natural light or air. Cupboard to hang clothes was filthy so kept everything in backpack for 3 days. On the plus side the location is great (literally 1 minute from Times Sq and main subway) and at least the doormen (or were they security...) were friendly enough. So in short you get what you pay for. I've stayed in many hostels and budget places all around the world and have stayed in better places in 3rd world countries. But this is NYC and you're not going to get a bed for 2! I may consider staying again if travelling on my own with limited availability elsewhere but it would be last resort!,natster
UR13335376,2008-6-February,It may have been 3 years and 3 months since we stayed in 'THE WORST HOTEL IN THE WORLD!!!!'but the experience has been embeded in our brainwe still wake in the middle of the night sweating!!!!!A stay in the CARTER HOTEL is not an experience you are likely or ABLE to forget!Our room was like a science experiment.We believe the 9th floor is the point of origin for every bacteria known to man.The staff were ignorant and unhelpfulthe bed sheets were dirtythe a/c unit at the foot of the bed measured 9 on the richter scale there was mould on the bedroom wallsgrime on the bathroom floorsharp broken tilesleaking pipestaps that didnt shut off and the original 'prototype' tv that did not have a single channel you could watch.when we requested a hairdryer and iron we had to fill in an order form and were told there was a FIVE DAY WAITING LIST! Not only that but in two weeks(yes 2 weeks! everywhere else was fully booked because it was thanksgiving!) did anyone make our bedchange the linenprovide clean towels or toilet paperwe were told that the chamber maids were ALL ON STRIKE!!appartfrom the unsavoury staff on reception who we confronted hourly with a multitude of complaints the only other employee we were unfortunate enough to meet was a porter when he knocked on our door to provide us with three packets of rat poison instructing us to place them on the floor along the window walls as the guests in the rooms on the floor above made reports of vermin! if after reading about our absolutely honest account of the Carter Hotel you still desire to book a room may we recommened you get yourself inocculated first! we would rather let the rats have the room and us sleep in the sewers than set foot in the Carter Hotel again truthfully!! absolutely awfull wouldnt recommened it to our worst enemy!,kevinWestMids
UR14064102,2008-5-March,I was in NYC for the Holidays and missed my greyhound bus to PA . I was stranded in NYC with nowhere to stay . I shopped around the alternatives for a few hours until i was so tired i opted for the Carter Hotel . Well let me tell you the place is actually quite scary  the rooms were dirty and damp . My duvet cover had a black mould on it and the windows are far from sound proofed . I personally didnt feel safe here . Not for the single traveller All in all i will not return,kevinoneill1978
UR14028824,2008-4-March,I just got back from three nights at Hotel Carter just today. Apparently I got lucky....the room was relatively clean though I would have liked some showers shoes. Never saw a bug and also never saw a maid. Luck plays a big part in this place. Yes the hallways were dark and weird and I had a gnawing feeling that I could go around any corner and see a junkie nodding off but I didn't. I jammed the door at night with a random chair that was in the room to be sure. Had I brought along ANYTHING of value like my laptop I would have never been able to relax while out and about. As it was I just had clothes and bathroom stuff so I left stuff in the room without worry and had no problems. The staff as a whole weren't dying to help anyone but one guy was alright. Location was ridiculously awesome. On another note.....Places like NYC need budget options for travellers that just want a bed and a shower. And the building has 700 rooms! All they have to do is keep it clean!!!!! I don't understand why they even go to the trouble of being open if they are just going to upset people! Hire some damn maids!!! I think a homeless guy was sleeping in the lobby but there weren't shady people hanging around that I saw. I came and went several times a day and I kept my guard up a little while there but never had a problem. One other weird thing...The shower was hot and POWERFUL. That thing was blastin' hard! It could easily knock over a child. Man that thing was like a firehose. Jeff from St Louis,jharper
UR22442975,2008-4-December,Welcome To Hell. The Hotel its self what a place short walk to times sq that a plus side of it. The hotel thats adiff story the room was cold and damp window as about to fall out held in with old news paper the hot water not worked at all the 5 days i was there.The door staff if you could them that was rude to people whe complained about the rooms they had been give by the man behind the counter. But then its cheap so you take your pick of the room i sat by the main desk and watched and listen to the complants come rolling in people changing rooms for something slighty better HAHA.,webrunner1957
UR18609164,2008-4-August,The location was really good: it was near both Central Park and Downtown and the metros and busses were easy to use. BUT from the first night we had little visitors.. The mice came the second day and the Heteroptera (bed bugs) even before. In the sheets we found little bloodspots and after a week one of our group had an allergic reaction (or something from the bugs) in her hands neck legs and arms. After a week they are still sore. They look like little bites but no way the bugs gould'we done all that so we guess it's some kind of reaction. We stayed for 10 days and they didn't change the sheets or empty the garbage the whole time not even when we asked.. The staff was nice and willing to change the room the minute we had complains they weren't even suprised of the mice or the bugs. I would probably go there again because of the location and the price. Hotel was also very quiet we had no problems with other clients. We had overall 3 rooms: in 1 there were ALOT bugs and some mice in room 2 we had little bugs and 1 mice (that we know..) and in room 3 we had nothing so I guess it depends from the room what you get..,Heteroptera
UR21417048,2008-31-October,Seven of us stayed in this hotel From October 24-27 2008 The staff were rude and not helpful. the rooms were dirty small and service is almost zero. I have 30 bites from bugs from Room 919 and we had rats in our room as well that ate our pizza during the night. Disgusting!! You can get online in your room only if you pay . In the dirty lobby there are several computers that you can get online but it will cost you five bucks to use 30 minutes. I made the reservation two weeks before we arrived and I made phone call the day before we arrived to make sure they have room for us but it turned out that they didn't give us the twin rooms at all because they told us they have overbooked. We ended up having two single rooms and one twin room which they call it a tripple room. More over the price they charged us is more than they advertised online. Discusting!!! You deserve a good trip in New York. Don't go to this place.,kingkingking2008
UR13152209,2008-31-January,The location of this hotel is amazing but that's about the only good thing. It's right in the middle of Times Square and everything you want is nearby. The staff are rude and not very helpful. The internet is very expensive. The rooms are old and the only thing that looked clean was the sheets. The bathroom was falling apart and the door was very rickety so I didn't tend to leave valuables in the room. It's also overpriced for what you get. I also read in the paper that a dead body was found in one of the rooms...but not sure if that's true. Anyway I wouldn't bother staying here you could probably get somewhere a lot better for just a little bit more money.,Angel1712
UR17382014,2008-30-June,this hotel is the worst hotel i ever stayed in . this hotel looks like the kind of establishment that rent the rooms fot hours  it was dirty our room was never cleand up there were cocoroches in the bathroom wich by the way its door does not close and the door had no knob. going to this hotel was the biggest mistake ever.dont let any one fool you into going to this hotel i think it would be better to add 60 to 70 dollas more to your hotel budget ans stay in some place else at least youll be sure that yur stuff wont get stolen. the carter hotel should be close down.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! carter hotel is a hell hole,diego25spy
UR13119381,2008-30-January,I have been meaning to review this hotel for some time. Travelled with two girls to New York for a conference. Luckily we had a heavily discounted student rate at the Marriott in Times Square during that time. But as we landed early we used the nearby Carter Hotel. -Staff are rude -Even though we pre-booked we had to wait 2 hours for our room. - Interior looks like its from a 70s murder mystery film. - There is only 2 functioning lifts which are near impossible to use during its peak use. and they wont allow you to use their stairs. - on arrival to our room it was messy un-made bathroom was worse the door didnt close or lock and u wouldn't like to use he bath there. it was only one night stay but a very uncomfortable one. the girls and I felt very insecure there we even slept in our clothes it was that bad. And we used the amenities in the Marriott hotel that day. I have been to New York before and know its an expensive place to stay. If you want to enjoy your time there it worth spending a little more on a comfortable hotel that you would be happy to sleep in. I would avoid the hotel unless you are travelling in a group on a budget and dont mind roughing it its mildly on par with a youth hostel I stayed at on 23rd street few years back.,aut0
UR15486365,2008-30-April,With the price I wasn't expecting much. However I got less than that. Our room had significant water damage a filthy shower with very little hot water (as in none) and a window that was jammed open. Additionally the room was lit by a single bulb hanging from the ceiling... with no shade. AND the toilet refused to flush. Classy. Suck up the fact that you'd have to share a bathroom and look at the Americana Inn instead.,particularwave
UR19714532,2008-3-September,I was in new york and needed somewhere cheap to stay last minute and the hotel carter was all i could find. I think I paid about 120 dollars a night (think i lasted about two) for the room which wasn't exactly cheap. I strongly recommend to try and find something better. Even if you don't stay long in the hotel room just to sleepit's just not clean enough. i've stayed in a lot of places all over the world but this was definately the worst. It's a very depressing place. It is in a good location but definatley not worth it. How much money must they be making though with all those rooms?,novotnaquinton
UR12312242,2008-3-January,First off I work at a hotel and am slightly picky when booking a hotel. We wanted to find a hotel in time square & in our price frame- We were not looking for a 4 or 5 star hotels by any means but when you get quoted 400 LESS than 99% of the hotels in the are you do begin to question why? You get what you pay for. A bed & a shower. After reading multiple reviews on here we still braved ourselves and ventured to Hotel Carter. The only MAIN complaint- MANAGEMENT they didnt honor their OWN hotel reservation & rate quoted on the email i brought with me.. We book 2 months in advance for new years eve & the manager literally told us to "get lost" if we didnt pay the NEW price posted even tho we had a reservation from 2 months earlier.. Considering there were 5 of us on a budget in NYC we had no choice but to stay...thankfully the staff (not management) worked with us but that was the ONLY problem we encountered. Yes the decorations are awful & old-fashioned..the sheets are not satin and the carpet isnt in the best conditioned but being 1 block from Time Square & the Subway you honestly cant complain. We found various things wrong with our room NO tv our window was taped our curtains fell off the light flickers only 2 plug outlets but we didnt let that RUIN our trip. We hardly spent time in that room we were in the city 90% of the time. We slept & shower that was it. Thats all its really for. We did bring our own sheets towels and plastic bed covers & bug spray.... the reviews really prepared us.. we saw no bugs & little mold. If you're a complainer dont bother. If you're looking for cheap & close.. go for it. Its not really that bad and if you have a sense of humor the things that are wrong & that do break will make you laugh. It was an on-going joke with our group. "Hotel Classy" :),FLGirls
UR22405702,2008-3-December,We checked into a small room with only a little window like a prison cell that was totally overheated and the TV was almost coming off the little board and was not plugged in because the cord was too short to reach the power plug; the bath tub was full with spots of some paint and hot water was not an option after 8.00 pm; after I discovered true bugs (bedbugs - hemipterans) and squeezed a few and they were full of blood I insisted next morning on changing rooms; we switched two floors down to a friendlier room but had the same problem with vermin this time some other bugs as well; so we moved out of the hotel - this is inacceptable!! Worst thing we booked over agoda.com and agoda wants to charge us for one night more like it is our fault that we had to move out of this hotel! Now they even want to have me get the confirmation of my checkout! Agoda has no customer oriented service at all! This was definitely the last time I booked over agoda! And I definitely never return to Hotel Carter and spread the word to avoid this Hotel under every circumstance!,gregjw
UR18351427,2008-28-July,This hotel was absolutely horrendous. If I'd have had the money I would have left in the middle of night for next door. Our room was ridden with TICKS and they crawled everywhere. I decided it was easier to keep watch and sit with the most covering clothing i had on the bed keeping watch and watching TV than dare to sleep there. It was absolutely horrendous. Every room was liek that and it's right next to a strip club. Under NO circumstances should you stay here... I'm not just someone who is mad at the hotel; it's legitimately a place not even fit for the worst of people. Should you stay here be prepared for ticks to spring from the walls and crawl over you while you sleep. Where long clothes and check your bed when you wake up for blood spots from where they bit you.,theredwonder
UR13917776,2008-28-February,Quite frankly it was the worst place I have ever experienced. The rooms were filthy and looked like they had never been cleaned there were used tissues under the beds and the walls were crumbling and mouldy. There were also carpets stapled to the walls and the whole place had the feel of something out of a horror movie. The curtains had holes in them and there were inexplicable noises coming from the heating/pipes. The carpets were filthy and clearly hadn't been hoovered for some time and there were layers of dust about an inch thick on the radiator. The sheets were stained and had hairs on them the bedspreads were also stained and threadbare. The plastic wrapping had been left on the mattresses from when they were purchased. The heating didn't even come on (and it is the middle of winter). There were cables in the room and a hole in the wall to the outside. The bathroom was equally dirty with enamel peeling off the bath and sink damp and mould on the walls. When we moved the toilet roll and there was a ring of dust left. The room also smelt musty which we couldn't do anything about as the windows did not open. We were also shocked and distressed to find our beds were infested with bedbugs. After the first night we were covered in bites which made us very uncomfortable and as a result negatively affected our holiday. We have also had to spend money and time dry cleaning and fumigating our clothes and luggage. We changed rooms on arrival having been appalled by the first room we were given but it seems that all the rooms were of a similar poor standard. We also complained directly to the hotel at the time and were told that there was nothing they could do in terms of a refund. The man we complained to admitted that the rooms were 'disgusting' and said that other people had also complained of bedbugs but was powerless to offer us any compensation. On our return we undertook some research into the hotel and found on tripfinder.com numerous other people who shared a similarly horrendous experience. They also reported bed bugs filty rooms and we were also alarmed to learn that there was a murder in the hotel last summer numerous room thefts and sightings of prostitutes in the foyer. This compounded our belief that they hotel was not a safe environment to stay in. Although we were prepared and happy to spend our time in a very basic budget hotel we certainly did not expect to stay in somewhere which was filty and infested with bugs. Hotel Carter has been classified by lastminute.com as having a 1 star rating. The definition of a 1 star hotel taken from the English Tourism Board is 'Practical accommodation with a limited range of facilities and services but a high standard of cleanliness throughout'. Hotel Carter did not come clost to the mark in terms of cleanliness. Although this hotel was not in England and I appreciate hotels are classified in various different ways we were expecting a reasonable standard of accommodation bearing in mind New York is one of the world's most modern cosmopolitan cities. On return we were horrified to discover that we had brought some of the bedbugs home with us and are now in the process of fumigating at great expense. If you have had a similar experiece please write to Watchdog and complain as we have. This place needs to be taken off UK websites. DO NOT STAY HERE!!,Becks17220
UR15341279,2008-28-April,This was the most disgusting place I have ever slept in. The room was filthy. The whole hotel stank. The staff were unhelpful. There was nowhere to hang clothes. The window was cracked and broken and a pair of mens socks were jammed between the sash. If you touched the walls the dirt came off on your finger. This place should be closed down. I didn't photograph if just being there was bad enough.,Scottishbarbara
UR21265019,2008-27-October,Upon taking the advice of an acquaintance (big big mistake) we decided to stay at the Carter hotel while in New York we were attending the Ashrae show. The one and only thing that is going for the Carter hotel is the location yes it is next to Times square and that is great. However that being said everything else and I mean everything else goes downhill to hell after that. The first thing that attacks the senses is the disgusting smell when you enter the lobby it turns out they have a small falafel shop attached to the entrance and day in day out you have this stench that permeates your clothing and body you'll have to spend money at the cleaners to get the stench out. Then we have the staff best way to put it they simply don't care!!!  they do NOT care. They also have a funny thing they will charge you to keep the luggage safe understandable but it would be nice if they didn't ask me to haul the luggage personally into the storage room. I can't add anything else because no matter what i say it won't make a difference. Then we have the rooms the rooms are filthy old smelly the sheets are old smelly and i wish i had blue light with me i'd probably see stuff that would make me want to pack up and leave for central park there at least you know what to expect. Another funny thing they have an old airconditioning unit in the room during the night the howling wind keeps you company we're talking January in New York (very very cold) and don't even ask for an extra blanket the phone doesn't work and don't take a shower after midnight no hot water!!! TV is busted no soap nor shampoo I took my only shower in lukewarm water with my slippers on yes the tub was that dirty. I was surprised when we were woken up at 8AM with costruction going on the same floor hammers banging and drills working no problem we left at 8:30 and came back at 11PM the floor were still dirty with the plaster and that plaster stayed on the floor for the next 2 days. Dear Readers I can truthfully say that the only highlight of my stay at the Carter hotel was when i checked out.,RAZOYANI
UR13033964,2008-27-January,If you live in a dump you're going to love this place but to all you decent people out there be warned. The ceiling was coming down the damp was rising up none of the doors in the room had door handles on and as for the rudenss of the staff don't get me started on that one. My advice to all of you reading this work harder so you can afford somewhere better or go and sleep on the subway it's cleaner.,Basil4545
UR20395760,2008-26-September,I know it's weird that I didn't even stay here and I'm writing a review. BUT I did book the room and cancelled within 15 minutes!! I only wanted to stay one night in NYC.. a place just to sleep this was a bargain hotel. I saw some photos... I only saw dirt and bad decor...I could deal with it.....so I booked the room. Then I continued looking at photos and reading reviews on TripAdvisor and saw all the BUGS... and worse... BED BUGS!!! How can someone stay here with BED BUGS?! If you get infected it travels all over your clothes your belongings. You spread the bugs all over and you bring them home with you. What a nightmare!! WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?! OK so after I decided to cancel I called Hotel Carter. The lady who answered didn't speak English. So I was very polite and said "Sorry I don't understand. I would just like to cancel my reservation." SHE HUNG UP ON ME!!!!!! I am stunned but I have to call back to cancel. She picked up the phone again and put it on the counter no "please hold" no "hello one moment". After 5 minutes of no one picking up to take the call I got someone who spoke English. I asked why the bad service and he goes "I don't know what do you want?" PLEASE SAVE YOURSELF THE TIME YOUR HEALTH AND YOUR MONEY. DO NOT STAY HERE!!!!!!,melissajwong
UR16412547,2008-26-May,The worst hotel we have EVER been to! The whole place was dirty - the Maid only comes every 2 days (and when she does she obviously doesnt do a great job - I dont think they even know what a hoover is!) Looks like it was decorated by a balldoser - cracks in the walls flakey paint....bla bla bla Then the ancient TV which had no more than 3 channels had a remote control....with no batteries. We got ill at this place & Im sure it was the dirty skanky room NEVER EVER GO THERE IF YOU DONT WANT TO DIE OF SOME DIRTY ILLNESS!!,FishCakes99
UR20377773,2008-25-September,Really a bad experience. The hotel is more like a cheap supermarket than a hotel. Better to stay in a youth hostel (which are pretty good in New York).,otterLondon
UR19344076,2008-25-August,Disgusting terrible very bad. My family and I went to this hotel I sincerely would not let my dog live in such condition. The room stink the walls are filthy the carpet is very dirty words cannot describe how bad this place is,lalubye01
UR22151595,2008-24-November,its so funny you just have to say something. I'm from uk england and on my first trip to NY. The location is unbelievable for the money. The first room allocated should have had crime scene tape and an outline chalk mark where the body was found! Good news is that we were transferred to another room and whilst it wasn't great with no towels and bedlinnen ever changed we did manage to get some sleep. The hotel does encourage you to spend time sight seeing NY which is exactly what we did not returning until late and getting up very early. Expect nothing and your expectations will be exceeded. Must mention that the horse and carriage guy at central park told us that the hotel was formerly a hostel for the homeless which explained a lot. You'll never forget it,shabba1964
UR17189283,2008-24-June,When searching for a Manhattan hotel for my May trip I came across the Carter offering an affordable rate good location en-suite etc so promptly booked it. This was without doubt the dirtiest scruffiest hotel I have EVER stayed in. The carpet was so dirty in the corners you could not make out the 60's pattern filthy windows curtains and dust so thick in the bathroom you were not sure what colour the paint was! The curtains were fixed closed to avoid seeing a window covered in grime 6 feet from a facing wall. Economy is one thing having to inspect the bed every night (no maids in 5 days) is another. 2 security men on the door nice chaps Osama Bin Laden could have walked in they would have nodded as he passed.,Duffy01
UR19276470,2008-23-August,One of the most disgusting hotels I've ever seen. The bathroom door didn't close. The toilet had a shoe print on it (meaning it was not cleaned). The bathroom window was wide open without a window screen (and we were on the top floors). Definitely sketchy hotel with the lowest possible standards. Not only that we were suppose to get TWO beds and they gave us ONE king sized (a take it or leave it attitude). I was so grossed out that I couldn't stay the night out in the hotel. The only plus was the central location.,y3ll3k
UR21096863,2008-22-October,I wanted to stay in NYC for cheap but we all know now that is/might not be possible. I came accross this hotel in the website lastminutetravel.com and booked it with out reading any reviews. After having reserved for Oct 18-21st. I decided to look at pictures of the hotel and reviews from other tripadivsor members. I was stunned by the reviews they had given this hotel. I was expecting the worst. I was afraid that I was going to find roaches rats bedbugs women of the night on the hallways etc roaming the hallways and room. I was really expecting the worst of the worst of the worst. But that was not the case. I mean I would not take my wife on a honeymoon here no matter how poor we might be but this might be a place you would stay with with friends for a bachelor party in NYC. Don't expect much of course for the price is fine if you're not picky. I would go back to this hotel only with friends.,djcnone
UR15219145,2008-22-April,It's been nearly eight months since I stayed in the Carter Hotel and my experience there most people wouldn't believe. - 3 hour wait for check in - ignorant and antagonistic staff - labour day weekend murder - dirty rooms I had been working in San Diego for the Summer on a J1 visa and finished the Summer with a few days in New York. The parents of the friend I was travelling with offered to pay for our hotel in New York as we both had little money and some of my family had helped us out at the start of our journey with hotels and hostels. When we arrived at the hotel I allowed him to deal with the receptionist as he had the bookin details. We were both tired from a lengthy day of travelling and were looking forward to getting washed up. We were made to wait for three hours on our room. The receptionist spent the three hours giving us a variety of different excuses why we couldn't be given a room. At first he was suggesting that we had no booking made yet we had proof (admittedly we had to search our luggage to find it) he then suggested that we only booked the room but had yet to pay for it that the cost of the hotel was not charged to the credit card over the internet and then when we had contacted my friends parents and gotten the credit card details to pay there and then and possibly again they proceeded to inform us that there were no rooms available for us at that time. Throughout this the receptionist was excessively ignorant and antagonistic. In the time we spent waiting in the reception there were numerous other confrontations between members of staff and guests. I recall one Scottish couple leaving the hotel in disgust marginally over the thirty minutes for a refund as they couldn't get back into their room as the key wouldn't work. Before I get to the room I should make it clear that the night before I was to stay there there was a murder in the hotel. I would include a link to a report about the murder but i am going to assume anyone interested can use a search engine and you'll see that I am not lying about it. It was Labour Day weekend 2007. There wasn't even the sense amongst the hotel staff to get the cops to take the body out through a back exit instead it was removed through the main lobby of the hotel. Like so many have said before me the rooms were disgusting never cleaned old and shabby the bath was disgusting the tap didn't work well there was food on the floor of the bathroom and we generally didn't feel safe or comfortable in the place.,prongs-d-red
UR14424634,2008-21-March,We walked in the lobby and like one of the other reviews overheard the person behind the desk asking a woman if the room she was in now was ok with her. Went to our room and nearly had an anxiety attack. The hall ways were like being in a really bad 70's movie. In the room the rugs were torn away from the walls the place obviously had not been vacuumed in sometime the sheets had burn holes in them there were the remains of a bumper sticker on the wall the phone cord was cut the bathroom was dirty but the single light bulb hanging open from the ceiling and the four locks on the door really made up my mind that we were out of there. Luckily they have a policy if you stay less than 30 minutes you get a refund...should have been the give away. The clerk was nice and when i said it looked nothing like the pictures on line he smiled and when i said you probably hear that a lot he just nodded. I should have took a photo but i was afraid to put my bag down to get my camera out. If they renovated they would make a killing great location.,5485

UR19156548,2008-20-August,My sister and parents stayed at the hotel just last week. They took lysol wipes just in case and cleaned the bathroom themselves. The room looked okay upon their arrival and they were having a great trip however on the last day my sister developed a rash and is now home off work for a week with a severe allergic reaction to what her doctor says are bed bug bites!! My parents were left unscathed. She is pretty miserable. Thankfully they washed their clothes/ luggage before taking it in the house and vacuumed their car right away. Hopefully none of the critters followed them home! Please do your research before booking any hotel I know my family and I will from now on!!,novascotiacanada
UR16621264,2008-2-June,My sister and I and some of her friends wanted a weekend in New York as their annual trip. We took the advise from one of the girls in the group as to where to stay for less money and we were sooooo wrong. When we got thier the people were rude short with my sister who made the reservations. We got to our rooms and they were on seperate floors it looked like the building had not been cleaned or updated since it was built and I found a map in our room that said the hotel dixie so you know that they don't go through the rooms very well. our room was cleaner then the other girls room but we had a revolting bathroom and the coax cable for the tv was broken the tv was unplugged and all the outlets looked like a fire hazard from the turn of the century. The other girls room had a nicer bathroom but the toilet was behind the door and was not only hard to get to but the door did not close all the way. They had a nice whole in the celling with mold and falling plaster. We we arrived we saw one of the bell boys drinking out of a paper bag. We left the second day but didn't get any of our money back.,ErinfromSR
UR16197596,2008-19-May,This is the absolutely the worst experience ever.the worst hotel ever most disgusting place there is this place should be made into a moseleum. there were drug dealers and drug addicts everywhere i felt like i was in prison and i actually paid for it too...... bugs bugs bugs felt like i was in a roach motel BUGS BUGS BUGS FELT LIKE I WAS IN A ROACH MOTEL HAD TO SLEEP IN MY SLEEPING BAG,nyustudy
UR17063270,2008-19-June,Anyone considering this hotel should think very carefully. The walls are filthy the bath unusable and there are holes in the window frames.

NEVER EVER going back even though it is cheap for NY I was glad to go home...,Katrienbb
UR20988059,2008-18-October,I was not asking for much. All I wanted was a clean bed and room.... i don't even need a television. The Carter hotels first impression was appealing due to the fact that it is in one of the best locations and it was cheap. From the minute I rung up to get directions I received no service. I got the response from an Asian Lady "Just get here!". Once I got there by cab i checked in and to my shock there was blood on both my beds in the room. The room had not been cleaned and there was still soap left behind from the previous guest. I went to complain to the service desk and the response was that they clean every alternate day and the cleaner is not here. I was burning up! I was listening to one of the guest next to me complain about a similar issue. They turned around and also said to him that it is not a 5 star hotel. The arrogance displayed in the hotel staff left a very sour taste in my mouth. The service clerk then gave me two bed sheets to change myself and that was the best solution according to management. The list of things that went wrong just piled from there on and to some up what happened I will wrtie down what happened to my 6 day stay on the hotel; 1) Blood on the Sheets the first day 2) On the second day the whole hotel completely ran out of toilet paper 3) Day 3 still waiting for toilet paper. 4) They never cleaned my room the 6 day i was there 5) I developed rashes form bed bugs and it was the same with my friend who was travelling with me at the time also sleeping in the same room but different bed. Doctors confirmed that it was bed bugs. This ruined parts of the trip and made both me and my friend irritated from scratching the whole trip. Bottom line is that I have photos that i was going to post up of the hotel and rashes. But after checking all the serious negetive reviews and warnings you have to be pretty brave to spend your money here. I am quite a simple chap and my advice is that it's hard to come home from travelling a hard day in the crowded city to an absolute rat hole. If you had just a little more money just spend it on a slightly better hotel.,Mr_Black_8
UR12768436,2008-18-January,i was really worried after reading the reviews for the hotel but it really was'nt that bad.The greasey smell comes from the shop attached to the hotel ok it was'nt the ritz but come on what do you expect for the money.I took my bleach and clean bedding and thats all me and my daughter neededyou go to New York to shop till you drop so basically we were in the room for a few hours a day.I keep an extremely clean house but i can say next time i go back i'll use the carter again,Biggerbund
UR22837197,2008-18-December,this was my first time in New york and in USA. I stayed at The Carter...it was awful.. this hotel should be closed.. I saw a RAT!! in my room. The bathroom was so FILTHY there was damp everywhere on the walls.. how can this hotel be allowed to operate in its present state.. something needs to be done..,tabitha41
UR15124515,2008-18-April,My parents came from France to see NY and without reading any reviews I booked 2 rooms for the 4 of us at Hotel Carter. This was the worst stay in a hotel I had ever. And we travel a lot all over the country and internationally. The hotel was a dump. Our next door neighboord looked like a homeless guy covered in pee. They gave us 2 rooms that were already occupied. They never cleaned the rooms. My parents had some cookies in their room and some rats or mice ate it during the first night. The bathroom were covered with black stain. It was horrible! What a way for my parents to discover NY. The staff was rude and non helping. It was a big mistake. Even for the price it is not worth it. I will never go back there.,mininoune
UR16099413,2008-16-May,You really get what you pay for here. The worst hotel (if you can call it that) experience ever. The beds actually had Bugs! Very disgusting. The room and bathroom were very dirty and they didn't even have curtains/blinds on the windows. I definately do not suggest staying here even for the price!,Luv2Travel8995
UR14311627,2008-16-March,their service is the worst I have ever experienced!. On the phone at least their front desk don't understand/answer your questions but instead keep saying "bye". I asked this front desk person's name for future reference he somehow got scared and stopped answering my calls. I called back many times. Later on while cancelling my reservation the other person from front desk finally answered my call but does not know anything about cancellation policy or how to cancel and like the last person he interrupted me by a "bye" and hang up the phone. very irresponsible no wonder there's only ONE Carter Hotel and I wonder how long can this ONE survive based on such service.,aspdof
UR20898597,2008-15-October,This is simple the most disgusting hotel I have ever seen or stayed in. There were no blanket on the bed just sheets and a bed spread. There were only 2 towels and one hand towel in the room no wash cloth. The carpet was torn on the floor full of stains and at least 25 years old. There was graffiti on the walls in the room and in the hallways. There were no lights in parts of the hall way and any one can walk off the street and in to the hotel there was no one to checking people coming in. Certainly no security and certainly not very safe. And when I left I checked under the bed for any belongings I strongly recommend that you do not do this. (It was full of garbage) If your on a budget stay in Jersey City and use the Subway. This Hotel Looks like something from Taxi driver. This Hotel is an Insult to all upstanding flea bag and flop house world wide. The 4 star ratings reviews on the Net have to be a fabrication from the hotel. This is simple Internet fraud. It looks nothing like the photos they give on the Net. Can you give a minus rating? How about a -5,stm
UR12639330,2008-15-January,I was very excited to get a hotel just seconds from Time Square for what seamed like a reasonable price $250. Unfortunately I was very disapointed. The staff had a can't be bothered attitude. On arrival I found that there were various small bugs in the room and paint curmbling off the walls in the bathroom and bedroom. The staff said there was nothing they could do about it as the building is being renovated so these thigs can happen! Never before in my life have I had to go and get roach spray for may stay at a hotel but this I had to do. When I went to bed I saw hairs and bits of fluf in it so I am not sure if the sheets had not been changed from the last person or if they had fell on the floor but it was very unpleasant and so I had to sleep fully clothed. My final grip is that for the 5 days that I stayed there my room was not claeaned so I had to take my rubbish bags to the street and make my own bed. It is such a shame that it was so bad as I was hoping to go there regularly as the price and location were great. But it felt more like staying at a bad hostel. I hope they get it sorted out as it would be a great place to stay if clan and tidy.,Ann2008
UR22735237,2008-15-December,cheap hotel next to times sq .clean new bed we most have been one of the lucky ones .air con was sellotaped to the window .room was not the cleanest me and my partner have stopped in but its new york .worst thing about it was the smell from the take away in front of hotel.porters and staff freindly and help full would go back next time we go to new york and hope we get a clean bed again,davecoggill
UR18979532,2008-15-August,Besides its location this hotel offers nothing good. When we checked in and went to our room our room was filthy and there were toiletries and bags all over. We told the front desk and got a new room. This "improved" room was disgusting--a broken tv and air conditioner barely room to place a suitcase and peeling "wallpaper" that was carpeting glued to the walls. The bathroom door didn't shut and the shower curtain was disgusting. The shower faucet had one attached knob-- so to adjust the hot or cold water you had to physically remove the knob and place it on the jutting out gear for the opposite. Simply disgusting. Had I known all of this I would have paid the extra money to stay anywhere else. This hotel clearly violates health codes and I wonder how it has stayed open and not been shut down by authorities.,peachrayz
UR16028037,2008-14-May,If sold as a cheap backpackers hostel it would be just about acceptable - but as a hotel no way. As previous people have said very dirty but amazing location. If you simply want a bed and a private bathroom with running water it is OK as its location is great just off Times Square. BUT If you want/expect any more then you will be very disappointed. The worst bit wasnt the room the front desk staff or the rubbish in the hallway but possibly the rudest female ( I refuse to say Lady as she is not) that guards the loby with her huge handbag ready to be rude to you at a moments notice. Good luck all who meet her!,carrymat
UR16924831,2008-14-June,My sister and I wanted to stay in NYC for a good price and judging solely by the Hotel Carter website this looked like the place for us! Boy were we wrong... We got there and while we were checking in five different people came up to the front desk to either asked for a refund as they were not staying there after viewing the room clean sheets and towels as they had neither in their room upon checking in or asking for housekeeping to clean their room again. That should have been our first clue. After checking in we went up to our room and found a ball of someone else's hair stuck in a hole in the wall someone else's dirty towels on the floor change on the unmade bed bugs crawling everywhere... this was all after we waited for it to be cleaned for over an hour and were assured that our room was "ready" for us to stay in. We refused to sit anywhere in the room immediately went back down to the front desk and asked for a refund (which we received without anyone asking us why) and promptly found another hotel in a better location for only a little more per night which we loved. I've stayed in a lot of hotels and I'm not a picky person but this place seriously should be shut down by the state - it's truly that bad.,ucfddd14
UR13544000,2008-14-February,I am amazed that this hotel is still around and they are still allowed to fleece people. I also complained to the Mayors office and this was 3 years ago! Since then and probably before they must have millions of complaints - so why is it still standing? We were there as part of Kenyan delegation from the hospitality industry in Kenya and we just could not believe what we saw and experienced - and all this in a super power country developed intelligent people etc etc. We are from Third World and I can assure everyone that there is no hotel in Kenya no matter how cheap that would operate this way. We literally could not bring ourselves to stay there and moved. I had to really shout at the rude orientals to get the deposit back on my room key but eventually she threw the money back from her little hole in the bullet proof glass! Our rooms were beyond disgusting. There were used condoms under the bed the sheets were filthy the trash was still there from I dont know how many people before the bathroom was absolutely disgusting the door to the room did not lock properly very fishy characters hanging around the corridors. We felt unsafe and felt so dirty just from being in there. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!! If anyone knows someone of authority in the US Tourism Industry they need to shut this place down because it give the US a very bad name!,Mujuaji
UR18967106,2008-14-August,One word... Disgusting! I can't describe the smell of this place. It's incredible. My girlfriends and I stayed there 3 days and we tried our best to never stay more than 2 hours in the room. We barely slept and when we did we slept we were extremely dressed - I had baggy sweats and a hoodie over my head!!. We took showers with our flip flops on and the air conditioning was noisy and smelled soooo bad. Yes it is definitely right in the middle of Times Square but really just too nasty. The service is inexistent and it is really really NOT clean!! You can't just walk in the hotel lobby to check it out you have to show the key to the security guard... and of course No visitors allowed either so you can't be accompanied even during the day - wonder why? Really not chill at all!,BeautyK
UR20041675,2008-13-September,The Web site claims "renovated rooms". While you do get a private bath with each room we had to see 3 rooms before we found one we could stand and we do NOT have unreasonable standards. Most of what we saw dates from the original building time probably the 1920-30's. The bathrooms had been redone probably 40 years ago with some limestone tile in the room we chose original white tile in the ones we didn't not in great condition in any. Each room has a window air conditioner and they all looked rather old but worked. Our room had double window with both sides having broken panes on top! One window was even duct-taped shut!! The bed was nice though even though the sheets were too small to even tuck in under the mattress! The windows were so dirty that we could not see too well out. Doors often did not fit well enough to close paint splattered carpets awful bare bulb on all lights in rooms we saw. We stayed on the 16th floor of 24 so we could see daylight at least! The rooms are rather small only a bed or 2 and an old Tv on a little table (no remotes). Recommend getting room with 2 doubles not a king as there will no doubt be more room to move around in there. We would probably stay again only because of the price and location which is definitely its best selling point 1/2 block off Times Square and easy access to everything. There was no sign of any insects but all in all it is pretty shabby. The clientele seems to be average tourists and we felt comfortable and safe. Internet for rent in lobby not too bad.,gljorge
UR21772128,2008-12-November,his place is complete trash. The room was dingy we only had hot water on one of the three mornings the tv was ancient and didn't work. However the bed was clean and I had a pleasent sleep. The bell boys/security guards are scruffy and a little creepy. As for location it cannot be faulted. Only 50 yards from times square.,Stevenhammond
UR13509348,2008-12-February,I stayed at this disease during gay pride week. when we arrived the lobby was full of asian people at first I thought I was in the Orient but anyway me and my partner checked in. We took our key and went he our first room the window was broken so we went down to the lobby and we spoke with the famouse rude asian women she gave us another room which was not any better so where do I start....the room was dirty and smelly my partner asked the maid in the hall to clean our room and she did after I gave her $20.00 we asked her to come and clean our room daily she said she would but we never seen her again (maybe she was the dead body that was found in one of their rooms) As we walked down the hall we saw a guy in the hall and he seemed to work for this dump but boy let me tell you he was a tweeker(looked like he was high) I felt very uncomfortable. we complained about all the things that are in all these reviews to no avail as for trying to get lucky at gay pride no way I would never have taken a guest to this room.well what more can I say oh yeah near the elevator the grafitti on the wall said Hell Hole and that my friends was an understatment. The maid never cleaned our room I started throwing my trash in the hall only to have to climb over it every time I came and went so for five days I had to do this.Anyway I can go on and on and on but all I will say is never stay here ever ever ever ever.....,fairway1
UR18881912,2008-12-August,Me and my girlfriend booked this hotel in April 2008 thru the Internet. We where going to New York to have a great time and we found Carter Hotel to be reasonable cheep and very central. According to the pictures on Carter Hotels website we found it to look nice. We do not demand much more than a nit and cheep hotel. When arriving to the hotel we found the reception to be reasonable but not good. The check in when nice but the staff was short in words and did not welcome us to the hotel. We got a room on fifth floor. Already when we stepped out from the elevator we found the corridor to be in a bad shape. Opening the door to our room made us laugh. The carpent was very old and we could see that it was very worn and the dirt was stuck deep into it. The wall painting was falling off and the sealing painting in the bathroom was also falling off. There was a TV on the room but not working. The air condition worked though. Under the bed we found ciggarett butts and 05 inch dust. The bath room was also worn and some days we did not have any hot water. We stayed for 9 days. There where no cleaning of the room during our stay and we had to ask for new clean towels and toilet paper our selves. The sheets where clean when we arrived but not replaced despite our stay for 9 days. If you are going to New York and want to stay at at cheep place Carter Hotel can be someting for you. But you must accept a room in poor shape and no service at all. We only used our room to sleep over night and was out in the city all day loong. Carter Hotel is more like having "roof over your head" while you are sleeping. Carter Hotel is in a very bad condition and it can not have been renovated for at least 20 years. Elevators worked fine during our stay. Our view was a brick wall 15 yards from the window.. Carter Hotel offers a very good location only 2-3 minutes walk to Time Square. At the corner 43 Street and Times Square there is a very nice Europe Cafe that offers nice food. The store wall to wall to the hotel does not offer the same quality. We are not the persons who needs a high classed room. I who writes this have stayed in many places and the only place worse than Carter is a youth hostel in Tokyo with cockrouches running on the floor. Normally I would not accept the standard that Carter Hotel offers. The standard is more like a place for people that has no money and no other place to go. For a tourist that rather spends the money on sight seeing and can live with a room in poor shape this hotel can be an alternativ. The pictures Carter Hotel has on their web site does not match the reality at all. If you like to have a normal standard room Carter Hotel is not for you.

UR20807265,2008-11-October,I went to Hotel Carter on a study-trip and it was absolutely horrible. In our first room there was a stank there were hairs in the bed which was also broken the tv and the bed lights did not work and the door to the bathroom couldn't even be closed. After complaining we got a new room which was dirty on the floor but better we thought... But no when we went back after being out all day we discovered that we had had a visit from rats. They had been in our bags and suitcases they had eaten our food peed and [--] in our luggage. My friends who were the ones cleaning after the rats also got flea-bits all over their bodies including their faces. The employees of the hotel thought this was normal and claimed that we also had that in Denmark. They even laughed of us. But fortunately (or what to call it...) they offered us a new room but after lookng at it we would rather switch with our teacher. Cause the new room had a big hole in the wall with bits of food. It felt like an invitation to the rats. Our 4. room was rat-free (so we think at least...) but was still dirty and with cockroachs. Two nights after others from our group experienced rats in their rooms and our teachers decided to move us all to another hotel. Other visitors saw a rat in the hallway and haunted it down with a shoe. The only good thing about this hotel is the location but is not worth it at all. I would not live their for free and will not recommand it for anyone it is health damaging and so disgusting.,Sallos
UR21749580,2008-11-November,DON'T stay here - it is so disgusting. Carpet in a really bad state hairs all over the bathroom blood on the wall a nipple clamp under the bedside table no bedside light. Noisy - kept up all night. Only good things were warm shower - in a dirty bath - and the location which was very central. Huge beds for a single room too. Had internet and Wifi which was useful.,travellinggirllondon
UR19947607,2008-10-September,In a word - BEDBUGS. Dirt grime stench broken appliances and damaged furniture is one thing. But getting completely monstered by blood sucking bugs that leave you with a severe and painfully itchy rash over your body that lasts for days sucks. This place was bad even compared to the hustlers at the 'time square hostel' down the road (48th st) who charge the same price (around $100) but for a bunk bed in a dorm room.,DinkieDi
UR14186722,2008-10-March,a friend of mine booked this hotel for our girlie holiday to new york- a word of warning this is the worst hotel i've ever seen!!! the wallpaper was peeling off the walls it smelled damp looked dirty there was a hole in the bathroom ceiling and had carpet on the walls in the hall- yuck!!! we stayed half an hour the time it took us to find a relatively cheap hotel elsewhere. i wouldn't recommend this to anyone. only plus point the staff were friendly- but they obvisiously didn't care about the state of the place...,cooper06
UR22619240,2008-10-December,DO NOT STAY IN THIS HOTEL! The rooms are dirty there are beg bugs! My friend has bites all over her body and I feel terrible about it! The service wasn't the greatest and the manager a little Chinese woman was less than accommodating! DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT STAY HERE! Spend your money somewhere else it will be worth it!,Toochi721
UR13959029,2008-1-March,When I saw the heading of Dirtiest Hotels in America immediately the Carter Hotel came to mind and I laughed when it was the first on the list. We booked a bus tour through a montreal tour company for a weekend trip to NY city. The hotel's location was great a few steps away from times square. But that is all the hotel has to offer. When we got there we checked in and as we were walking up to our room we saw fellow travellers opening our door...we got a new room We brought our own sheets and I showered with my flip flops on as well as never taking them off in the room. There wasn't any shampoo and the soap we were left was that of the previous guest--used. Sitting in the lobby I felt like I was on a bad acid trip. Honestly for the price I'm not sure you can't find much better in Manhattan but then again I havn't tried. I'm sure the hotel was nice the year it was built.,AshGlobetrotter
UR13167152,2008-1-February,Look at the pictures. The rooms looked terrible upon arrival and had not been cleaned for a long long time. Some of the room doors had marks after break in and the whole place felt very very unsafe. It is not all about location and price. Stay away !!,AngeloBergen
UR22350081,2008-1-December,We want to give you a big WARNING about staying at Carter Hotel! There are bed bugs in this hotel and you dont easily see these bugs but after one night you see the bites and they itch terribly for many days! If you get bed bugs home with you youll have a hell of a time getting rid of them and youll need an expert. They are about 10 millimetres and brown and there are small ones about 2 mm. We collected a few of the bugs (see the pictures) and went to the lobby to show them to the hotel manager (the lady in the middle of the lobby that doesnt seem to have a single feeling in her body) she hardly reacted at all she just told us to wash our hands!!!!! But obviously it was no problem to her that the bed was full of them. We went to the police station at Times Square and the police were chocked and told us to contact the Health Department (in US you dial 311). They also told us to show them to the other guests at least so that we would get our money back but we did not want to spend more time of our visit on this so we just left the hotel (and our clothes). We will be contacting international media to inform and warn people about this. Sensitive people could get an allergic reaction to the bites and it could be dangerous. Its not worth the price at all (even if it would be for free to stay there)! Then there is the dirty rooms and arrogance of the staff and in case of fire it is a death trap. This hotel is a shame to NY and should be closed down NOW and every responsible NY politician should stay one night there (and then it would be closed down for SURE)!,NYlovers
UR14698650,2008-1-April,I stayed by myself in a King Room on the 18th floor on kind of a corner overlooking Madame Tussauds Wax Museum. OK so it's old. It ain't fancy. It's rough around the edges. There's no hairdryer no coffee no clock radio in fact my end table was a lawn chair. The one dresser in the room was small and old. The TV was old but I never even turned it on. However there were also NO bugs and NO mold in my room. The sheets were clean. There was no blanket on my bed when I went in so I went back downstairs and asked for one and got a brand new one fresh out of the plastic. The mattress was firm so must have been relatively new. The fixtures had been re-done in the tub/shower (but the old ones just capped). The bathroom had been re-tiled floor and shower walls with "marble". The shower curtain seemed new and was clean and mold-free. Things were not "finished off" so there was putty around outlets pipes etc... The carpet was relatively new and basically clean except around the edges. It appeared to have had a "lick and promise" type vacuuming. I had 3 windows so it was nice and bright with the curtains and shutters opened. It was a little warm but the bathroom window opened so I was able to let fresh air in. I stayed 3 days. They didn't clean the room during my stay but there was a cleaning guy around in the hall when I was heading out the one day and I asked for fresh towels and he was more than generous with them and asked if I needed anything else. I'd asked for fresh ones the day before at the front desk and while they didn't have face cloths once again they were more than generous with giving fresh towels and they were clean. OK so it had it's quirks...and it's old and kind of rough around the edges but you can't beat the location or the price. I got a single for $99 plus tax came to $116...unheard of in the Times Square Theater district. I'd booked online for a little more than that but I wasn't going to argue with the man! One drawback was no internet in the rooms. They have 6 public computers with stools. You can buy internet time for $5 for 1/2hr and proportionately less for longer periods of time. The elevators had been re-done with similar "marble" to what was in my room and were quite fast and ran smoothly. The doormen were friendly and helpful. The small deli downstairs was handy. If you aren't planning on lounging around your hotel room and you're on a budget and it's just a place to sleep while you are doing Times Square or seeing Broadway shows you can't beat the location or the price.,OntarioFlylady
UR7818453,2007-9-June,We had reservations for one price I knew it wasn't the best hotel not even an average... but for the price it seemed OK. When we arrived there were signs saying that the online reservations were invalid and the price increased like 80 dlls. I told the receptionist it wasn't fair because they never sent an e-mail or anything... and she told me: "Do you want the room or what..." We didn't have anywhere else to stay so there was no choice... After that some guys got stuck in the elevator screaming desperatedly asking for help they were like half an hour inside... Our room smelled pretty bad the bathroom was with many stains and the water was all stinky and dirty. I'm from Mexico and I swear I've never been in a worst place in my entire life.,Camo23
UR11426361,2007-9-December,This is absolutely the most disgusting place! The room was dirty with stained carpeting sheets walls etc. No towels were provided and we needed to ask for them at the front desk. Once I received the towels I realized I would have been better off asking for a cocktail napkin!! There was only a stained top sheet on the bed and I had to ask for a heavier blanket at the front desk. The "blanket" they gave us was an old bed spread again with stains holes mold and overall rather scary to put my body under. I used my winter coat as a blanket instead. There were no lamps in the room; just an over head light bulb with out a fixture covering it. There WAS a TV however no remote control and a picture that left me seeing double. There was no heat the first night and the second night it was too stuffy. I was upset that I didn't have my flip flops with me as I would have used them when I took a shower. And speaking of the shower or lack thereof... the temperature at best was lukewarm and even though I only took a 3 minute and 47 second shower the water was ice cold when my boyfriend jumped in right after me. The conditions were so bad that we spent half of our first day in NYC looking for other hotel availability... we were ready to spend anything at that point just to get out of the squalor that this place calls a hotel. Unfortunately being the holiday season every hotel we went to was sold out. And we really would have paid anything just to get out! I am honestly shocked that the department of health hasn't condemned the place!,ubd12c
UR10055721,2007-8-October,You can't beat the location of this hotel. 2 blocks to the subway 1 block to Times Square 2 blocks to the half price ticket booth for Broadway Shows. The sheets were clean. It goes downhill from there. There was garbage in the drawers (beer bottles food wrapers garbage ) of the only piece of furniture in the room. There was no cable hook up for the TV and we had to run an extension cord from the bathroom to the TV in order to get it to work. The carpet had not been vacuumed in years by the look of it. We only stayed here as there was nothing else available in New York City. After the first night I tried to book something else in another hotel but there was still nothing available. I'll book much more in advance the next time to avoid having to take this hotel out of desperation.,CanadianIslandMan
UR7567904,2007-8-May,I was there in the middle of tourist season. I read all the reviews and I still gave it a chance. The place was a very old hotel. It is in need of some renovations. I did find a pillowcase that said "I"M YOURS" in the middle of a heart which you will not see again it is now in my new york collection. But do not expect room service: sheet changing toilet paper changes or room cleaning unless you make a huge fuss. If all you want is a place to lay your head go if you are looking for the hilton pay the extra 300 per night .bring your own linens if you are very picky but the place is good for traveling friends. OH bye the way we were switched from a very small room and the reviews were right you have to leave your luggage at the door cause you can not roll it around the bed it was very tight just a little leg room in the middle of the room. and there really is carpet on the walls but the heat works great we were sweatin to the oldies literally.,kissncuti
UR6565139,2007-8-January,Carlsberg don't do hotels but if they did ... this would be the farthest thing from it. OK before I begin what is most definitely going to become a "rant" I should mention the one good thing about the Hotel Carter. That would be its location; its in a fantastic place close to Times Square the bus terminal and a short stroll to 5th Avenue. Ok now for the "rant". I read a mixed bunch of reviews before I went on my trip about haunted rooms thefts and it not being the best of hotels. But I thought "hey Ive stayed in some pretty cr*ppy places how bad can it be? Well let me tell you it can be BAD!!!! We (my girlfriend and I) arrived at the Carter late on Thursday 14th December 2006. We were greeted as we opened the door by the delightful whiff of the greasy cafe that is for reasons unknown adjoined to the hotel entrance. As we climbed the hotels steps tastefully decorated in Technicolor patterns set off by the various tones of dirt grime and trodden in chewing gum I took the opportunity to admire the strange dolls that are displayed in glass cabinets around the entrance. As I admired them and the 3 working Christmas lights that surrounded them I enjoyed the tasteful out-of-tune music that played in the background. I can only compare it to a musical Christmas card that was low on batteries. Not put off my girlfriend and I made our way to the reception. The first thing that struck me about the reception area was the fact that it had clearly been designed to stop people leaping the counter and attacking the hotel staff. This being New York I thought perhaps these sort of things happen. When I met our "Friendly" night receptionist I soon learnt that all this security was in fact to keep her in. To say this woman was rude is an understatement. She had clearly attended the Adolf Hitler School of charm and passed with honours. After we received what I can only assume was the standard level of abuse and rudeness (and were charged for the pleasure) we made our way up to our room. We were on the 19th floor and let me tell you a ride in the lift (which I believe was last serviced upon the buildings contraction) is an experience in itself. Will you make it? Wont you make it? Its all very exciting. When we got to the 19th floor hallway the first thing that strikes you is the lighting or rather lack there of. There is a 40 watt bulb once every 40ft so its kind of like staying in a poorly lit multi-storey car park (but dirtier). We made our way to our room and arrived at our door that was tastefully decorated a nice shade of green/dirt with a few dents and smashes for good effect. On entering our room we saw that it was last cleaned some time in the mid thirties. The linen looked relatively fresh except for a very suspicious stain and the bathroom  well lets just say if the room was cleaned in the mid thirties it was by a lazy cleaner who forgot to do the bathroom. But still as Ive said Ive stayed in some bad places and was not about to let a few decades of dirt an abusive receptionist and dodgy lift put me off. I was in NEW YORK BABY  Having emptied our stuff into the spacious wardrobe (ooh another good point sorry there was two) my girlfriend decided to have a quick wash before bed. As she did this I lay on the bed and decided to check out the wonder of American television. No sooner had I turned on the TV then came a yelp from the bathroom followed by the door opening and my girlfriend in fits of hysterical laughter. I walked over to see what was going on when I noticed what was coming out of the taps. Now Im not too sure how to describe this but it was kind of like lumpy gravy with flecks of grey. Thankfully we did have both hot a cold running versions of it. I was going to phone reception to complain when I remembered that this may mean I would anger the receptionist and god forbid they set her free to come find me. So we left the taps to run for 10 minutes or so and they did eventually run clear. So I went back to my laying on the bed and watching TV when something caught my eye on the wall. I looked and with the reviews of this being a haunted hotel ringing in my head I saw a pentagram had been etched into the wall. Fan-bloody-tatstic! Immediately wanting to get this out of my mind I thought I go to the window pull the curtains back and have a look at New York by night. I was quite impressed with the 5 square foot of Times square I could make out from our window and watched the bits of HUGE advertising boards I could see light up and change. As I stood there I became aware of my right leg starting to get cold. Assuming the ghost of the Carter had come to get me I slowly glimpsed down to take a look at it. But instead of a gruesome spectre I instead saw that there was a hole about the size of my fist in the wall leading directly to the outside world. I was all set to complain when I realised there was actually a better view of Time Square from the hole than there was from my window. So that was my initial experience of the Carter and frankly in the 2 nights that followed it didnt get any better. No doubt you are now reading this thinking well if it was so bad why the hell didnt you change hotels? And the reason for that simply was we were there with another couple and the chances of getting 2 rooms on the weekend before Xmas were not good. Plus I wouldnt have been able to have such a good rant had I stayed somewhere different. So in summary  would I stay at the Carter again? NO. Yes it is cheap but not cheap enough to warrant the state the place is in or the rudeness of the staff. I would highly recommend more spending a bit extra and staying somewhere where you dont need several inoculations before visiting.,the.lonely.traveler
UR7293063,2007-8-April,I took 30 music students and several adult chaperones into this hotel for a two day stay in New York - at the end of our Great American Bus Tour. It was booked by a travel agent. We walked into a dirty cheaply decorated lobby. Miserable looking people sitting all over the lobby. A drunk with a bottle in a brown paper bag staggered off the elevator as we were going up to check on the room conditions. We get to our floor and there's a crime scene investigation underway - an overdose - and the body is still in the room. The beds were stuffed into tiny rooms dirty roaches no decor whatsoever. Yes it's cheap but you need to know that you are getting exactly what you pay for. Needless to say I got my students out of there pronto and found another hotel.,moonchild658
UR10657834,2007-7-November,One would generally not go to New York city for a hotel experience and especially not the Hotel Carter. The location is fantastic and the area is safe but aren't you lucky that you are only staying for a few hours per night! The shower water was hot the toilet flushed OK and it had beds just. Included with the beds were welcome visitors... bugs and they welcome new visitors with relish yum yum yum and leave one with their calling cards. The 1970's style TV had sort of a picture on a couple of channels and there was an air conditioner of some sort. The reception was OK. If you could find another hotel as convenient do so,travellers92007
UR6762420,2007-7-February,Our room was dirty and the hallways did not look safe. The hotel's hallways looked like those from COPS or NYPD blue TV show. The Chinese clerks at the reception desk were rude. Customers were made to wait in long lines at the reception desk. I demanded a refund and left this hotel. Then I went to the Doubletree at Times Square which was a million times better.,FrugalDude
UR8665938,2007-6-September,Dirtysmelly..For a couple of dollars you can get a better place at least clreaner...It is easy to travel in New York cityyou don't need to be close to Times Square...It was a nightmare the halls smelled so bad and when I saw the room(that was not made because the service is non existant0I rushed downstairs to get an immediate refund..Don't be fooled by the picures on the website...To avoid!!!,BEAUMEC18
UR10044907,2007-6-October,Surely nothing i can write about this hotel has not been written here already never been anywhere worse. As soon as we walked across the tacky lobby with piles of carpet in the corner and up to our room with bottles and bottle caps on the floor we knew why it was so cheap. A TV that didnt not work a window that didnt close and some suspicious white stains on our bedclothes all added to the ambience!!! Luckily there was so much to see in the city we only spent about 2 hours in the room we did not sleep just sat and admired the dump. The shower would tear strips off you a single jet of water like from an industrial power washer needless to say we didnt use it the sink had to suffice. We knew the management didnt care so we didnt even waste our time looking for a clean room or anything else. The room next to us put a towel out in the corridor at about 22.00 and as we were leaving about 1300 the next day the towel was still there where are the most basic of standards?? The only positive I can muster is the location right off Times Square but I would recommend paying a little more for some basic human rights,droginexile
UR11280026,2007-6-December,My brother currently lives over in New york city and was going to run in the Major Marathon just gone. So myself and my father decided to visit him for a few days. As my brother currently lives in times square he suggested the hotel carter just off times square.Now i must admit i do not generally read the reviews but if i had i probley would have stayed at home. I was absoulty taken back at the appearance and street where it was located. The bed was broken down the middle + dirty the T.V was left on and seemed to turn off on its accord. Beds were not made and bathroom had looked like it just been used. I was under the feeling the guests had already "occupied" the room. The 1st nite did not go any better I felt like i crawel into a barrel of bugs and woke up bitten all over.Now on complaint to the management we were moved to another room located looking over the street.I must admit it felt like we moved hotel.There were two beds a double and a King size bed made up room just funished. Bathroom few holes but nowheres perfect. I must say it was not the best place i stayed in but the location and price are a story above them all!,PauloGalway
UR6555883,2007-5-January,It boggles my mind how people can give this anything but a terrible rating. DO NOT STAY HERE! If you see reviews about rats roaches broken toilets theft and a non-english speaking staff why would you risk it just to save money? Well.....I did for New Years Eve. The hotel boasts FABULOUS ball drop view rooms! Its an outright lie. I had our room guaranteed for $150 (amazing price for new years) but they jacked the price up 80-90 dollars at the front desk. Their reasoning? Well first he said another company runs the website and they screwed up. When I told him that its their fault not mine he told me that "Someone hacked into our system and changed the rate it's supposed to be higher". Riiiight. that makes sense. What a mastermind that hacker must have been. I explained to the "manager" that this did not make sense at all and he kindly told us "if you dont like it then you can just leave". I work in the hotel business and travel a ton and this is the FIRST experience I've had that was this bad. Please I'm begging you not to stay here the good reviews were probably written by the same guy who will steal your luggage. It's not worth being stuck with no place to go in the middle of times square!,chaub
UR8356357,2007-5-August,Homeless people in Times Square would not take the offer to stay a night in this place. We were greeted in our room by a dead cockroach that has probably been there numerous stays before us. We had 1 wet towel in our bathroom for 4 of us. The television is from 1950 and the cable wire was cut and laying on the floor. This is and will be the worst hotel you have ever stayed at if you do decide to try it. Its not worth the cheap price unless you wanted the filthiest horrible experience on your NYC trip. Don't think people are exaggerating on here! Go somewhere else!,nowocke
UR8654378,2007-4-September,After waiting an hour for them to clean the room (two hours after check in time) the room still had hair and stains on the toilet no towels used soap trash under the bed and no window (yes the window was actually busted out). We quickly got our money back and moved on to the lovely Gershwin hotel which was well worth the extra money.,WhatInThe
UR10469581,2007-31-October,The worst hotel i've ever seen. sleep in Central Park but don't stay there. It's a really fetid place don't consider such horrible place I didn't sleep for 4 nights  because have fleas in the bed when i come back i had a alergic crisis. It's incredible how New York give a permission for this kind of thing someday will have a tragedy there the place is ruining. Bye,Mefistoteles
UR7260284,2007-31-March,I had this hotel booked for 5 days but when we arrived they said they are overbooked. We had to spend 4 hours in a very dirty lobby with 2 kids. There was about 12 other families who couldn't move in because rooms where not ready. Staff was very rude. Twice in 4 hours police had to be called in to settle disputes between staff and guests. When we where shown our room it had no quilts no pillows no towels. The door to the room could not be locked. We ended up by walking out and moving into another hotel.,OzTank
UR8264005,2007-31-July,This hotel is disgusting. I can't believe that places like this are allowed to exist. Just because people are on a budget doesn't mean they should have to stay in absolute filth and decay. The lobby is full of disgusting couches that have gaping holes in them and do not match--I see better furniture on the side of the road. Our room had 4 small hand towels and that's it. We asked for some more towels and the man at the front desk told us that there would not be any clean towels for 4 hours. The room itself is also disgusting. Only one of 3 outlets worked. The bathroom door did not fit into the door jam. The bed was made but covered in hair. There were crumbs all over the carpet and who knows what else--possibly some mouse feces because I have heard that this place is a rodent hole. Does anyone know where one would report such a place? This is a serious health hazard for tourists and needs to be shut down. Though seeing as they manage to find paying customers every day I doubt something would be done.,DeeDee2525
UR8613539,2007-3-September,Location is excellent!! Then it is all down hill from there. With paint peeling off from around the bath tub and Mould over the tiles. There was a bent coat hanger in the plug hole to allow the water to flow down as the was so much hair it was completely blocked. The tub filled up to about mid calf level for a very short shower. As well as hair around the tub filthy carpets and a dirty Blanket shoved behind a shutter to the window. About 6 inches between the beds and the furniture you had to walk over the beds to get to the other side. The staff were not polite except for the lady at the travel desk who did what we asked. A wait list for a iron that never arrived and carpeted walls throughout. You are only paying for the location on this one.,Livindreams
UR10564554,2007-3-November,we arrived at the carter apprehensive to say the least....worried! scared! as we'd read the TA reviews we expected the hotel from hell and we were'nt dissappointed. the lobby was so funny have never ever seen one like it .neon lights patterned carpets..... we took all our own sheets pillowcasestowelscleaning stuff and flip-flops etc but when we went into the room the sheets were brilliant white! so were the towels! what a suprise.... we checked the beds for bugs only to find that the beds and mattresses were brand new.! amazing! we didn't use the wardrobe or drawers (kept our clothes in cases) as they didn't look clean. the bathroom door wouldn't close as we had expected the tin bath had been painted and was peeling and the hot water tap in the sink ran constantly!!! tried to turn it off and it came off!! hilarious! it kept us awake at night so we wrapped a hotel towel round it to stop the noise of the trickle (not drip) only to wake up the next day to find the towel had turned a lovely shade of rust brown!!! you can't make this stuff up. we have never laughed so much at a "hotel". on the plus sidethere was plenty of hot water the location is great ..and that's it! oh the doormen and staff were friendly. we stayed there for 8 nights and i got bitten on the 1st three. i blamed mosquitos (not bed bugs ha ha) as i was sleeping next to the open window as it was hot. we also swatted a few mozzies on the lovely white walls! (knew the flip-flops would come in handy) the maids only came in once (clean towels sheets) which suited us. you can ask at reception for more. we only used the place to sleep there it's not a nice place to be awake in. when you wake up go out. when you come in go to sleep. we took the carter as a huge joke but if you can't see the funny side of this UNBELIEVABLE hotel don't stay there. if only they would spend some money on the place......cos its location is great. would we stay there again?....NO! we've experienced it!! one last thing if you can get a hold of some "anti-depressants" before you go it will make your stay much nicer! wish we had then we wouldn't have to be on medication now!,tomthecat
UR7542261,2007-3-May,This hotel was disgusting. It may be one of the cheaper hotels in Manhattan but it was still pricey for what you got. They charge $1 for each room key. The room was nasty; it looked like it hadn't been vacuumed in 10 years. Service was slow and unfriendly. Do yourself a favor and spend an extra 50 bucks and stay somewhere nicer.,Traveler090
UR6544673,2007-3-January,My husband and I stayed at the hotel last october and although it wasn't the worst place i've ever stayed in it certainly wasn't the best. Price being a major concern we booked our room having read the negative feedback and it was with some trepidation that we walked through the doors. Tackiness was the only discernable decorating scheme and curtness was the order of the day from the staff. We headed up to our room which was mostly clean but very basic. the TV didn't adequately work only discovery channel and no one came to our room for the duration of our 4 night stay to clean or replenish supplies. That being said the experience wasn't that bad. we bought a replacement roll of toilet paper in duane reed brought an extra towel from home and learned a lot about how the pharoahs built the pyramids. The location of this place truly can't be beat you are really in the thick of things and this was the cheapest place to stay that i could find online with a private bath. I've stayed at other nicer places previously in NY but this place was ok for what you spend. Basically if you possibly can afford to stay at a nicer place and aren't willing to rough it a bit stay elsewhere. If you'd rather spend your cash hitting the town and seeing the sights and are willing to rough it a bit this hotel is just fine. If you want the Plaza stay at the Plaza.,sarahkat
UR7712698,2007-29-May,I made a bad mistake of deciding to go to NYC at last minute for a long weekend. I booked this hotel. While I was checking in there was a fight in the lobby...not by the guests but employees. The bellman told us to make sure we lock our rooms because theft is an issue. We went in December during the holidays and there was actually a snowstorm that happened right before we arrived. THERE WAS NO HOT WATER!!! The toilet broke like 3 times we saw two roaches in our room and we think at night we heard a mouse. The room was just gross. We tried to find another hotel but no luck. DON'T DO IT!!!,thorionthei
UR6710066,2007-28-January,My company had a contract with this hotel to put up its traveling employees while we were in new york city I have stayed at this location many times and not once did I feel safe while in my room I would here my door handle being shaken from the otherside as if someone where checking to see if the door was open so they could rob or still from me if I were out of the room so I made it a point never to leave the room my company eventually switched us to another hotel around the corner The milford Plaza which is also a dump...beware you get what you pay for,Railroadguy
UR11087332,2007-27-November,yes the hotel is cheap and next to times squarebut that's it!! i was there with my parents for 4 days.i was first in new york and had to wait for my parents who had a long trip from europe..at the time i was waiting in the lobby was a women(she worked there but she looked and spoked like a sleeping pill)talking to a police man.she told him that a women who cleaned there stole a lot of stuff from the rooms..hhhmm.after thatpeople came to this women and told her that their room looks terrible they were really angry! okmy parents arrived really tired and they were happy to take a shower and relax somewhere...untill we saw the room!the carpet was really dirtythe cover from the bed was also dirtythe bathroom door didn't close.they never came to clean.and we had always to ask for more toiletpaper at the lobby and take it up in our room.so when you ask mealso this less money you have to pay them is too much! in this hotel you think twice if you really go to take a shower and you look that you are just for a couple of hours in the room to sleep otherwise your going crazy! at the endwe saw that some mouses began to eat the swiss chocolate which my parents brought!so what do you prefer?to pay a little bit morefor a clean room(it don't have to be very luxury but this was not even standard!)or do you want desgust if you have to go to your room in the evening?i guess just the youth hostel is much better...,priskaSwitzerland
UR6849605,2007-27-February,When arriving at this hotel they had conviently lost our booking which turned out to be a blessing. We only had to endure the rotten place 1 sleepless night. It was unkept and unclean. The beds were not even made up from the last occupants of the room. Would never stay there again.,xienc
UR8518641,2007-27-August,Well where do i start. From the moment you walk in you know you should have walked out .(especially when a staff member said he's family was staying and he will clean the room himself) Our room was booked for four people we had two double beds ( with someone elses short and curlys over them) but only two pillows and two towels. We asked for two more towels and pillows but was told they had no more pillows left and they would try to find more towels we are still waiting. The furniture was from the local trip i am sure it was that old and dirty. The bathroon was disgusting slime all the way down the bath mould all over shower curtain and missing tiles. We went out and brought disinfectant it was that bad. When we turned on the light switch a blue spark came shooting out which blew out the light and left us with only light from the bathroom. Having a shower was bad enought with all its mould but turning on shower the handle fell off right into the slime we couldnt get off. When i told management they didnt care at all. I dont know how NY health department hasnt close it down. ITs a health risk to all that stay there,ollie07
UR10009417,2007-26-September,The main reasons why I booked a room at the Carter Hotel are as follows; I was on a budget I wanted to stay in Manhattan and finally I had not read any of the reviews regarding the hotel. When I booked the hotel I informed them of my late arrival and they told me that this would not be a problem. However on the night I arrived I was greeted by this very annoying employee basically telling me that there were no available rooms because I was late. I was shocked obviously. We had a bit of an argument at the reception. The annoying manager whose English was terrible told me that they would refund the money I paid into my credit card and that it would go back into the card in a few days. Now I was so angry with the hotel at that moment that I would have happily accepted this offer but the problem was that they were not going to refund me with cash. I didn't have any other source of money. If I had the amount of money that the average Manhattan hotel requires I would not have stayed at the Carter in the first place. Anyway after about 10 minutes they found a single room where me and my two friends had to stay for the night. The following day they put us into a double. If they hadn't found that single room we would have literally be homeless during our 10 day stay or we would have had to put all our spending money to book another room and have a miserable holiday stuck in our hotel without anything to eat. Other problems included - - Constant police surveillance. Now. You might think this is a good thing and I guess it is but you just feel awkward when the lobby is constantly watched over by police officers. - The sheets were not cleaned. - The walls were crumbling - We stayed at the hotel for 10 days and the towels were changed just once and that's only after we asked for them to be changed on the 3rd day. - The people at the reception were rude inexperienced and were behaving in such a way that you wonder whether they're slaves working without pay. - The television sets in the rooms are a complete waste of space. You can't see anything and barely make out what is being said. Advantages - - Spectacular location - Cheap - Decent size rooms I will not stay in Carter again. I'm just a student so I don't have a lot of money and I cannot afford a Manhattan hotel but I love NYC and I've decided that from now on I will stay in hotels in one of the other boroughs and travel to Manhattan on the subway.,SamBerk88
UR6700246,2007-26-January,The Hotel Carter is probably the worse place in the world to stay. The bed mattresses are torn and filthy; and raw sewage runs from the hot taps from time to time. There was almost no enamel left on the bath and the shaver/hairdryer plug sockets were situated right beside the shower - approximately six inches away and were very badly damaged. The carpets look as if they have never been vacuumed since they were fitted - probably around 1950; and the hotel constantly stinks of stale food and goodness knows what else. The heating stayed on - full overnight two of the nights we were there and there was no way of turning it off and of course the air conditioning didn't work. The staff are unhelpful and unfriendly; and when we asked to speak to a manager about the state of the place we were told 'he is not available at present. On the day we checked out we left a written message for the manager to contact us - that was six weeks ago; and guess what we've received no communication from them whatsoever. Unfortunately we had booked and paid for the hotel through their own website and when we asked for a refund so that we could go elsewhere to stay we were told they do not give refunds. Don't let this put you off going to New York it is the most amazing place and we had a wonderful time despite not wanting to go back to our hotel. We have visited New York before and stayed in a lovely hotel the Metropolitan on 51st and Lexington and it was no more expensive than the Carter.,Brendazzz
UR11049533,2007-25-November,I have just returned from NY after staying 6 nights at hotel Carter and I am all over bitten by bed bugs so if you can please avoid the hotel. It is everything what other guests have described already; filthy smelly..We stayed in 5th floor however our toilet was "clean" no bugs there but otherwise the room was smelly carpet filthy (haven't been vacuumed in moths years maybe..) and the worst thing was the bed bugs..I only hope that I haven't brought any bugs with me at home.,Stinde
UR7982224,2007-25-June,I went to New York for a funeral and I decided to look for a hotel online to book. Went to [--] and of course being in a rush and the fact that it was their "Pick of the Week" ?? I decided to book a room for a couple of nights. When we first get there my friend pointed out the ripped couches festooned about the lobby & really well ground in dirt theme decor. The front desk looks like you should be cashing out your chips not booking a room. I asked to see a room - "No I don't let anyone see the rooms".... says the guy behind the bullet proof glass Alllllrighty Then!!??? My girlfriend and I thought to ourselves "How bad could it be? and she being able to speak Spanish asked a Mexican family all ready to leave in the lobby how the rooms where. Next thing I heard was "that's it! -- three of the family members said "there were bugs in the room and try to get a room high up" making little critter movements with their fingers hmm guess it takes a while for the bugs to catch up with the new hosts" Oh well "- I'll take the loss on the booking rather than show up at the funeral with itchy rashes all over. Thanks [--] for recommending perhaps the worst hotel in NYC.. Astalavista both.... Patric,PatricFitz
UR8885476,2007-24-September,This is a terrible hotel!. Budget does not need to mean dirty but this hotel is. We had bed bugs in our bed and I was bitten all over we changed rooms only to find cockroaches!! We would have changed hotels except everywhere was booked! The carpets are filthy and paint is peeling off the walls not to mention there was a murder there in 1999. It's a central location but not worth the hassle!!!!,lotte24
UR8227096,2007-24-July,Here's the good news the Hotel Carter is right in the middle of the action. It is literally right around the corner from the wonderful Times Square. Unfortunetly thats about the only thing going for the hotel. The bad news is that yes there is a very noticable and distinct smell to the entire hotel and it is not a normal smell that you get use to. It smells like pee mold and like its never been cleaned. The lobby is decorated with torn furniture neon lights and some very shady residents of the Hotel. The office staff was ok they were quick and efficent didnt lose our reservation or give us any problems. However if you get offended easily I wouldnt even bother going there because the front desk are young kids who repeatly said "hell yes"  "[--] no" and "word" when asked questions. The hallways have mismatched wallpaper with old flat carpet that is bumpy and had lifted up. So make sure to pick up your feet and bags or they will get caught on the carpet. The room was small but mostly clean. I never saw any bugs or critters. There is a lot of "gunk" on the walls and the paint is chipping everywhere. The windows had a brown film and were cracked so bad I thought if we touched them they would fall outside. The beds were hard as a rock but after a long day of walking its not hard to fall asleep anywhere. The carpets are flat dirty and if you walk around barefoot you get a black film on your feet. So we refrained from putting anything on the carpets. The bathroom was actually pretty clean and the shower worked wonderfully. There was also an air conditioner that we had to plug in ourselves but it also worked wonderfully. Bottom line if you are just looking for a very cheap hotel to stay at this is your place. It is ideal if you are going to spend most of your time outside if the hotel and just sleep there. Also because of the dirtyness tackyness and a large number of strange guests and residents I would try to be in the hotel itself as little as possible. I wouldnt walk around the hotel alone and I never did without husband because it just seems like a lot of bad people and shady business is around there.,rebelandsaint
UR10258632,2007-23-October,So you're thinking about staying at the Hotel Carter...Well DON'T! My girlfriend and I have stayed here twice because of the budget price that comes along with the hotel. There's a reason for it. Everything you've read about is true...and then some. I for one have never noticed any bugs or rats and am grateful for that. But seeing all of the other reviews and having stayed here twice I can honestly believe the other reviewers. For one the front desk people can barely understand English. I understand maybe having a little trouble speaking English or whatever but when you are in the hotel business and over 90% of the clientele will be speaking English it should come into consideration when hiring front desk people. However at the same token check in is fast but bring reservation confirmation! The lobby is something straight out of a dance club with blacklights and the such in the lobby itself. There are unused carpets stacked high in the right corner of the lobby as well. Very unappealing. The elevators take forever to come down but are realtively quick once you are on them. Now to the rooms. The hallways are very dark and creepy looking as if you are about to enter your own horror movie. Upon entering our room there was a very musty smell. The TV barely worked only getting maybe 3-4 channels that worked properly. We can hear some other channels but the picture didn't come in at all. I had to physically move the TV around the room to try and get better reception mind you this is cable reception NOT rabbit ear antennas! As for the cleanniness of the room it wasn't too bad but did notice alot of dust in corners and some fallen debris from the ceiling. The bathroom door does NOT shut. I've stayed here twice and neither door has been able to close properly. Unbelieveable. Next the lack of maid service. We stayed for 2 days and never once did I see or at least HEAR a maid cleaning the room. We had to get more towels from the front desk and make our own bed. Probably a good thing seeing as how I wouldn't want any of the people that worked there in my room to begin with. The only good thing I can report about this hotel is the Lucky Star Cafe which is next door adjacent to the hotel. Good food open 24hrs a day and relatively cheap for New York. Last but not least a murder has recently occurred there so now the police have stepped up their presence. This place should be condemned. I've read it used to be a homeless shelter in the 80's and after seeing some guests in there as well as in the elevators with me I believe this place is still used for such activities. Please...Anyone wanting to stay here take heed and follow everyone else's advice. It's not worth the money (even if it is cheap) as the risk to your health is overwhelming in comparison to the price.,BigPTrain
UR7210198,2007-23-March,world record cockroach infestation-i pulled back the bed headboard and there was hundreds on the wallall sizes. they changed my roomnever stayed there again. dont forget your video camcorder-my biggest regret.,goodlay
UR8223529,2007-23-July,do not stay here. words cannot describe how bad this place is. find somewhere else quick,mallowman
UR8852496,2007-22-September,This hotel is the worst hotel on the planet and i do not know how the place still exists. I have to admit it is a fantastic location and it was quiet cheap however that is as good as it gets the staff are rude and swear at you if you dare to complain i was given 4 room keys and every time there was already someone in the rooms totaly unsafe. The rooms are filthy and have never been updated since the 60s and have not been cleaned since then either. there were holes in the windows the locks on the door should have said it all as there were at least five. I did not dare get under the covers of the bed slept in clothes went out and bought cleaning products to clean the bathroom. just a bad experience full stop which is a shame as ny is a fantastic city .,vmac69
UR7966744,2007-22-June,The place is a dump. It is a hotel that has not been maintained for decays. The rooms are filthy and the bathrooms are worst. My wife and I made it through by staying out of the room as much as possible. Here are some problem areas: receiving personnel are not friendly and accomadating rooms are not serviced by staff(we did not dare walk bare- footed on the floors.) room appearance was gross room and vistor's area smells from lack of up-keep hot shower difficult to come by furniture in room has already served its intented use years ago was charged for room card key after returning it TV is just as old and has only 4 outdated channels with lousy reception. You are better off paying a little more and getting a better hotel. This hotel is not even a one star rating. New York is a great place...don't let scams like this hotel rob you of your money and enjoyment of the big apple. We learned from this experience to check internet hotel reviews before we book.,TexasTravelingTwo
UR6641336,2007-22-January,ok where do we begin?!?! after a 14 hour flight 2 hour wait in the airport and an hour journey to the hotel we couldnt wait to finally get to the hotel to end our journey little did we realise the worse was yet to come!! The hotel didnt look like any of the pictures but hey we were in new york!! As we walked in we were told by one unhappy family to turn around and walk straight out to find another hotel! there was one couple in the que in front of us at reception who although had a reference number did not have a room we went on to wait a further hour listening to the high pitched screech that was coming from behind the desk we then saw that it was our receptionist!!!! she seemed to love the misery of this couple and was doing nothing to help. we finally got served and lets say we were scared! im so glad there was a barrier between us and.... lets call her it! she took our money then insisted we pay a further 50 each were still unsure why but you do not want to mess with this woman for the worry that she may be unleashed! We kept telling ourselves " were in new york were in new york" we kept our spirits high and travelled up in the wee scented lift ....mmmm! we couldnt help but notice the carpeted walls that hadnt been cleaned since the day they were put up in the 1900's! but nether the less there was a bed waiting behind a door calling our name! however it should have been calling for the cleaners name! our room and our friends room had unchanged bed sheets over flowing rubbish and oh yeah cant forget the previous which now seemed like existing occupiers belongings still in the room! we then nervously approached the receptionist who was yet again participating in her favourite hobby being unhappy and yelling at anyone in sight (great customer service skills may we add!) after we explained the problem as nicely as we could we were given new rooms these werent anything special but they were at least semi clean and not in use! or so we thought a couple of days later at about 11pm a confused woman walked into our room with her luggage after just being handed a key to our room! if we hadnt been there or she hadnt been nice she could of taken any of our belongings due to the hotel not supplying a safe or any form of security! In the ten days we were there we changed rooms twicethe second time being because we returned from a long day out to find our toilet overflowing with lets just say a lot of runny number two's beautiful!!! our room was only cleaned once they also managed to steal all our unopened food! Thanks for that! From reading this please dont think were moany hard to please people because were really not. Were students who have been to a number of low rated hotels but this is by far the worst and even though the location was great and we had a good time it still slightly put a damper on our time in new york because we knew we had to return to the hotel every night and walk sometimes run past the caged scary lady in the hope we weren't seen! At the beginning of our holiday all the things that happened to us at this hotel were laughable as this was the only way to cope but at the end it was tiring and fustrating and we just wanted to go home! if your thinking of booking to stay in this hotel please dont unless your a sucker for punishment! if you already have keep smiling its the only way to get through it and we wish you good luck !!! :-),xhappyholidaysx
UR7416242,2007-22-April,This place was very disguisting. There had to be at least 2 inches of dust on the walls and floor. The bed was described as being a king size bed it was two twin beds put together with a big gap in the middle. The beds were terribly uncomfortable. There was a drunk crazy man running around the hotel and nobody seemed to be do anything about it. There was no soap in the room. There was paint falling off of the walls and ceilings. The smoke detector had been taken out of the room and the back piece of it was hanging from the ceiling. As soon as I walked in the room and sat on the bed the enitre dresser fell apart. The front of the drawer fell and hit my roomate's foot. The staff was not friendly at all. All of ther television channels were in spanish whatever channels were in english didnt even come in clear. The toilet was leaking water all over the bathroom. This place is a five star roach hotel. It WAS NOT worth 117$.,wow777
UR7958820,2007-21-June,I checked into this hotel alone about 6:00 pm put my suitcase in the room and left to have dinner. When I returned at 10:00 pm I noticed that in my absence someone had been in my bathroom and defecated in the toilet and left without flushing!! When I told the desk clerk his response was "Why was someone in your room?" (Exactly my question to you Hotel Carter). When I told the "security guard" his response was "What do you want me to do? It's late." I checked out immediately. I went back the next morning to ensure that my credit card wouldn't be charged. The desk clerk told me that the charge slip was ripped up when I checked out. Three days later $232 in charges appeared on my credit card for two nights stay at the Hotel Carter. Calls to the manager Abdul (no one knows his last name) have gone unanswered. For the cheap price I didn't expect luxury but I did expect to feel safe. And I don't expect to be charged for a room that I didn't stay in and then to be lied to about it repeatedly. The behavior of the staff of the Hotel Carter both on that night and since then has been criminal - they stole money from me as surely as if they had gone into my wallet. Steer clear!,kallen344
UR6629916,2007-20-January,I stayed at this hotel and had a pleasant experience. However I had an idea what I was getting into. My room was old but clean. I had no bug problem and all the pluming worked fine in my room. The bed was even comfortable. The TV only had a few channels that worked among them were the History Channel TNT and USA so I was happy. There were not enough towels so I took it upon myself to grab a bunch from the cleaning cart in the hallway. They have free wifi in the lobby and paid computers to use if you dont have a laptop. You really don't want the help in your room cleaning because there is a big theft problem at this hotel. I kept that in mind and took my laptop with me in my back pack. I also kept the TV on while I was out. When I stayed there in Dec the hotel claimed that their credit card machine is broken and will only accept cash. I suspect that is because of all the refunds and disputes. Anyway if you use this hotel with the proper information you should have a nice stay.,LadyInLexington
UR10029866,2007-2-October,Myself and two of my friends stayed at the Hotel Carter because of the location and the price. A week after we left the hotel we all broke out in what looked like mosquito bites on our hands arms feet and legs. My doctor can't be sure what caused the outbreak but I am currently under treatment for Scabies and Bed Bugs.,SassySara
UR7540374,2007-2-May,I have to say that I took a chance on staying at this hotel and I really regretted it. I'm someone who has a pretty high tolerance and I don't need to be staying at the Ritz but this was really dirty and depressing. The first room was so bad that I asked to see a second one and that was only slightly better. It was just for one night so I suffered through it. I slept with all my clothes on and couldn't wait to get out of there in the morning. I kind of knew what I was getting into but it was worse than I had imagined. Also the cost of a cab to the airport was cheaper than the private car that they encouraged me to reserve in the hotel lobby.,jpdorning
UR6539303,2007-2-January,warning dont stay here! this is why: *bed bugs (see pic) *non english speaking staff *cockroaches *changing prices when chacking in *warm dusty rooms with no air,skeppis
UR10123734,2007-18-October,This hotel was so bad words can not begin to describe! I was travelling with friends and even though we were on a budget it was worse than we could have expected. They made us pay for our entire stay upfront and we soon found out why. The room was disgusting. It was still dirty from the previous guests...dirty sheets with wet towels on them lining paper (not even wallpaper!) hanging off the walls hairs all over the bed sheets and all over the bathroom and in the shower mildew and insects in the shower the list goes on. When we went to reception to complain they ignored us at first then said if we wanted something done about it they would give us a note and we could go and find the housekeeper to let them know! The place has 700 rooms it would have taken all day to find them! Eventually they gave us clean sheets and towels however they room was not cleaned and still looked disgusting. My friend was also bitten repeatedly by bugs during the night. I understand it's cheaper to stay here than other New York hotels but it is not worth the money!,bumblebee5
UR10907776,2007-18-November,I have stayed in many hotels in the United States and Europe ranging from luxury hotels to really low budget places. I can honestly say that the hotel Carter is THE WORST of the lot! Please ignore the room picture that they post on their web site after staying there I can only qualify that picture as a deliberate scam! When you arrive at the hotel you have to deal with their desk attendants there is a particular Chinese lady who is positively THE RUDEST hotel clerk I have ever encountered in my life. My room looked like it had been last renovated sometimes in the late 60's with a renovation cost of maybe $10 tops. The walls were dilapidated and dirty the carpet completely filthy. The closet had no hangers or drawers to speak of and it looked more like a very dirty tool shed than a place where you would like to leave you clothes in. The bathroom was a nightmare. The TV remote didnt work there were no lamps and the bathroom light was broken. The bedsheets were torn and the whole room had a musty unpleasant smell. When I tried to reason with the lady I mentioned above she repeatedly tried to walk away from me. After I stopped her a couple of times she pointedly told me that they did not cleaned the rooms or changed the towels. After a heated discussion she gave me two towels (I refused the first she gave me because they were fithy and had burn holes in them) and a light bulb for the bathroom that I had to change myself. I would have gladly walked out and tried another hotel if my stay hadnt been paid for in advance. When I returned home and set out to write this review I was further apalled to discover the horror stories from other guests (or victims?) of this place. Do yourself a favor and NEVER book this hotel. New York is a great city and staying there shouldnt have to be a nightmare. There are other options in the budget end for Manhattan hotels that provide at least a minimum of cleanliness and comfort. If you still decide to contemplate the Carter (for whatever reason!) at least read beforehand the New York Post articles of August 31 September 1 and September 2 of 2007 that describe the dead body of a young woman discovered under the bed in one of the rooms by a maid!,MexicoCityOrfeo
UR7638856,2007-18-May,This was terrible. i mean horrible. i mean nasty. i mean it was the place from the shining... I went to New York on a business trip and a travel agent booked this hotel because of the prices. nothing like production houses looking for the cheapest deal... and boy did we get one. on the outside looks fine. we checked in late and there was a BOUNCER in the lobby to throw people out! i mean what kind of a hotel has a bouncer employed in the lobby?! i traveled with the group we checked in went up a tiny lift to my floor and it has been a long time since i've seen a hotel with the tiniest corridors. my room i would have wagered was not cleaned and i too ended up sleeping in my clothes. it was so run down. the windows were paper thin and did not keep out the noise of the street below. the tv did not work even for local channels. there is internet in the lobby but it is so antiquated i really hated to use it and the keyboard was gummy and sticky - really gross. also in the lobby was an immigrant from africa who lorded over the place even tho he admitted that he did not work there. he also admitted that there were travelers in the past who leveled assault charges on him when he was an employee of the place! before i left the computers he then grabbed me and would not let go. thankfully my colleagues showed up and i managed to get away. i cried all night long. my colleagues were up til 4a getting our reservations canceled and in the morning we packed and left this hell-hole. i even needed an escort out of the lobby because my nerves were shot and i needed to work that day! i've been reading more recent reviews and there are no mentions of this man so hopefully he has moved on. I am a tv personality and the kind of person who attracts attention even when i don't want it. if you are that kind of person too then avoid this place. I did not feel safe here. we were supposed to stay 4 nights here. we did not last but 1 and i'm glad for that. also in a closing note i was part of a travel show with many men on the crew. we have stayed in some real dives in our travels. even they were disturbed by this hotel and demanded to leave it before i did.,ljbp31
UR7925670,2007-18-June,This is the worst hotel that you could possibly have the misfortune to stay in in any city in the civilised world. it is cheap and well located but that is where the good news ends. This hotel has probably never been cleaned or decorated since the 1950's. There was a dead cockroach in the middle of the room and it stayed there for the duration of our stay. The plumbing is ancient and a joke. The shower just filled up the bath and the water was still there when we returned to the room 12 hours later. The door to a neighbouring room had been kicked in whilst we were out and the occupant repaired the damage by hanging up a towel. The best motivation you could ever have for getting out of the hotel early in the morning and seeing the sights of the city. Do they do food? I hope not for the sake of mankind.,Mark4625
UR8141324,2007-18-July,Spend some more money and go to reputed hotel. This is the worst hotel you can ever imagine. Carpets have come off. Furniture is all broken. Looked more like junk yard of some kind. Just dont even go near. I can not really explain  just would like to say You will die of shame after staying in this hotel.,onceuponabear
UR6800711,2007-16-February,I stayed at the hotel carter in January. It started with the check in and the $1 'Key service charge'. I was scheduled to stay in for 3 nites but decided to check out the following morning blame the jet lag for not checking out immediately. No heat in the room. The receptionists were really rude who cannot even speak English. An old man sleeping in the lobby. A Chinese guy seating at a desk in the lobby oblivious of everything that is going in the hotel. When you asked him a question he states "Not my problem". I moved into the Milford Plaza the next day. I paid a little bit more but it was worth it. I noticed they had no security at all at the Carter Hotel. Be careful for what you pay for!!!,DBosworth
UR6596721,2007-15-January,I regretted that I did not saw the pics that other travellers posted before I make any decision. The website was having some difficulties uploaded the pics but I managed to see some pics from other website uploaded by the hotel and those pics seems alright for me for the price. However when we arrived we were shocked by the conditions of the hotel; the staffs werent friendly at all especially the old lady whos in charge with the Expressed Check out. When we went up to our floor we were speechless when we saw the mismatched uneven and dirty carpet. It become worse when we went into out room absolutely worse that I expected. Because I was the one who organised the trip and booked all the hotels my husband go really upset and angry of the hotel I chose here. The carpet is the most disgusting the bathroom taps were leaking at least it was still acceptable. The bed is still acceptable but I saw a few pubic hairs from whoeveruuwww. Most TV channel were bad reception the table would be something they took it room a junk yard the chair was dirty all kind of stains on it. We stayed there a total of 6 nights room service only 1 time and the cleaning lady throw my pillow I brought on the floor!!! I had the washed the cover. One night we were awaked by noises from people arguing on the corridor my husband heard the lady screaming at the hotel staff or security that someone stole her bag from the roomscary!! Everyday we saw a lot of people checking into the hotel a lot of them looking around either with their jaws dropped or shaking their heads disbelieving what they have got themselves into. There are also some graffiti saying pig hotel and others. One last thing you wouldnt want to bond your luggage there. They charged $2 per luggage and into the room with a broken lock half open door that everyone can walk in. The lady who I mentioned earlier dont give a [--] who walked in there. Overall she got a bad bad attitude. There is one thing that I do agree with everyone it is situated on a great location. If you dont mind to pay a bit more and enjoy your holiday there I would highly recommended Westin Hotel which is just 2 doors down from Carter hotel. Very nice decoration great staff and free spring water everyday from the lobby.,John&Penny
UR8713135,2007-14-September,So we arrived at hotel carter after reading many negative reviews on this site and expecting the worst. Me and my friend were traveling around America after working at a summer camp. We booked into the Carter for the same reasons that i suspect 99% of its clientel does its cheap alot cheaper than (at first glance) most other places in this great location are. As we were expecting the absoloute worse when we arrived in the lobby we were pleseantly suprised although obviously dated the lobby isnt what i was expecting ie. crawling with cockroaches and transexual prostitutes. The staff were "new york friendly" (no niceties but not overly rude.) When we got up to our room things became a bit more like we imagined. There was beer bottles and pages of porno under the beds from whoever 'used' the room last. The bin in the bathroom still had rubbish in from the last guest and the bathroom definately wasnt clean. All of this i can deal with at least it had its own bathroom we said to eachother and the location is undeniably great being a 40second strole from the infamous times square. So we went out soaked up our first day in the city and went back to the room at about 1 in the morning. I went to bed in my sleeping bag as the sheets wernt clean and i didnt fancy sharing a bed with our previous beer swilling porn reading guest. When we woke in the morning i went to get my wallet from the TV table to find it open and cashless. When i went to sleep my wallet contianed $260 cash it most definately didnt in the morning. What is particularly worrying about this is that the doors on the hotel rooms have the credit card style swipe entry thing which means that it must have been a member of staff who came into our room whilst sleeping and stole from us. This is a rather worrying thought. When i reported this theft to the reception as we were checking out of our 3 night stay 2 nights early we were simply greeted with a shoulder shrug and a "what can i do?" not a helpfull response. I would avoid this hotel like the plauge no matter how cheap it is it ended up costing me an extra $260 a night than i expected. If you are looking for cheap accomodation in this area check out the Super 8 Hotel which is very near by. Its prices are much better if reservations are made in person and the facilities are in an entirely different leauge to that of the 'hotel' carter.,reasy3088
UR7605202,2007-14-May,This hotel is a SCAM! I read the reviews too but thought that I could deal with a dirty hotel for a couple of nights given that the location and price were so good. But as soon as we arrived we were told that the price had now doubled! This was despite the fact that we had a confirmation from the hotel itself and their response to us was 'Well don't stay here but good luck because it's New York and New Years'. I refused to stay on principle because they did this to every person who walked in then they changed it for some but not for all. We ended up findinf\g a beautiful room at the Radisson right around the cornor from the Empire State building at New Years and it wasn't that much more expensive than the new price that the Carter wanted to charge us. We were lucky and we have also lodged a complaint with the NYC Consumer Affairs Dept and I encourage all other people in the same boat to do the same. Here's the link: http://www.nyc.gov/html/dca/html/resources/complaint.shtml,LillMS
UR6787856,2007-14-February,We booked for 9 nights we were able to survive only 9 hours!!! that means once the attack from strange instect started. Never had such a bad impression about an hotel. We had to escape at 7 o'clock in the morning. ONLY ONE SUGGESTION: STAY AWAY!!! the money you save and the good location will never ever worth the dirtyness of the rooms and the "strange" attitude of the armoured-glass (wasn't just a b-movie story?) reception's personell.,Manlio72
UR11560162,2007-14-December,This was the worst hotel I've ever been. It was dirty it smell and it did not have air conditioner. The bathroom had cockroachs and death mouse inside the toilet!!! You cannot even dare to sleep in the dirty sheets or use your bare foot in the room carpet. After one night (without using the bathroom of course) we had to change of hotel. But what can you expect for 100 bucks in NY during Christmas?,Klauser
UR10799080,2007-13-November,When we arrived and were given the keys to our rooms which were both on the 6th floor (where the murder had occurred-we found out about the murder afterwards!) we were horrified when we went in. The bedlinen was stained and filthy and the bathrooms were disgusting. The smoke alarms were in the drawers and obviously not working! When we went back to the brothel-like reception they offered us 2 alternative rooms which were also no fit for animals never mind humans! We demanded and refund and they charged us $25 for inspecting the rooms which I will demand back from my credit card company! The staff were unpleasant to be polite and that IS being polite! If you have no alternative but to stay in this 'hotel'- I suggest you buy a cardboard box and sleep on the streets-it would be cleaner and safer!!,cbyrne8
UR8112090,2007-13-July,My flight was canceled I needed an emergency hotel but none was to be had. I wandered through Manhattan hearing "All booked sorry." Then I found the Carter. I hit 43rd Street and saw the huge Hotel sign. In the lobby Im so tired I don't really absorb the crowd. It's a dive but I'm not thinking straight. I go up to the desk and the guy behind the window tells me he has a room. "I'll take it." "OK. It's $116 plus one dollar nonrefundable room key deposit." "Fine" I say and pull out my credit card. "No. Cash only." He sees me look at the Mastercard and Visa signs. "You can pay by credit card only if you have a reservation." "Well give me a reservation." "It's too late for a reservation today. Cash only." I pull out my money. He passes me a plastic room card with 1031 written in bleeding red marker across the front. I get in the elevator with some teenagers reeking of alcohol. The elevator door creeks opens on ten and I know I'm in trouble right away. The exterior room doors are all badly painted a vomit-teal-bluish hue. I put in my key and open the door. It gets worse. The bathroom. The tub has rust stains. There is no shower head just a pipe sticking out of the wall. I turn the heavy silver metallic cold water knob and immediately the hot water knob falls off and clatters into the tub. The toilet has no tank so the opened toilet seat falls backwards and looks like a pitiful gaping mouth jaws wide. I close it then feel like I should wash my hands. But I see no soap. And no shampoo. There is no stopper in the drain in the sink. Later the cap of my toothpaste falls into the sink and disappears. Across the bathroom is a closet. When you open the door you see the emergency exit plan. For the Dixie Hotel. Which I can only hope was the name of the Carter Hotel some lifetime ago and they simply didn't bother to change the sign. Above this was scrawled a profanity laced poem I cannot repeat here but it alluded to bed bugs and unclean toilets. An unmarked phone sat on a rickety table. No alarm clock. The king sized bed was the most sanitary seeming thing about the place. A large mirror with a piece of broken frame sharply protruding hung on the wall. A functioning air conditioner mercifully sat in the window behind a receptionless television. A metal coat hanger sat in the corner. I intuited why I had been made to pay cash: no refunds no refuted credit card bill. I went back downstairs to ask for another room. The earlier guy was gone and the night shift guy had taken over an older man. I asked him if he had a better room. He gave me a pitiful look innocently shrugged and said "They're all the same." He handed me three tiny bars of soap. I walked outside. As near as it is to Times Square this section of 43rd is pretty desolate. Across the street is the entrance to a huge parking garage. Across from that is the Cheetah Club where I saw a dancer screaming at the guys in the parking garage. Before going upstairs I asked the front desk for a wakeup call. "Does the phone ring pretty loudly?" I asked. "I don't know." I went to the room and took a shower. Or rather it took me. Because the pipe sticking out of the wall was bent toward the back shower wall I had to sort of push myself against the tile wall to get wet. Then the drain immediately clogged and the water got to ankle level. I then took the metal hanger and put it's hook on the frame of the door on the inside so that in the event some criminal broke open the door (the secondary lock was long gone) at least the hanger would clatter to the ground to alert me a second or two. After the shower I got fully clothed and laid on the bed on top of the covers and tried to sleep. I got up with my 4:00 a.m. wakeup call and escaped in a cab to airport. I emailed some of this adventure to my friend a long time New Yorker who emailed me back: "I should have told you whatever you do don't ever stay at the Carter Hotel.",lavenders3
UR11526583,2007-13-December,Bugs on the bedroom - they gave me another room and guess what. I found more bugs. Its dirty and old. I stayed there for just one night and then I moved to another hotel. And they didnt give my money back for the others nights that I paid.,carolsabo
UR7348177,2007-13-April,Oh my. I don't know if Hell Hotel or Fawlty Towers is the better description. I hate when management is nasty to the staff in front of the custormers and there was plenty of that. A dragon lady guards the lobby lest someone sneak away without paying the bill. It cost us over $800 to stay here for 6 nights. No service in terms of sheets and towels but our room was manageable since we were on the floor where the water remained warm enough for showers and we spent next to no time at the place other than to sleep and email. We appreciated being right at Times Square. While we managed I felt badly for European tourists with kids coming here. No Americans seem t stay here and I can see why. Still I am cheap and this was quite cheap for NYC standards. We were able to go to Broadway shows for the money we saved. However I would think twice about repeating the experience and it did help my comfort that I was there with my husband. It makes for a good travel story but perhaps that is not what you are looking for.,60iesdame
UR8700030,2007-12-September,I can honestly say this is the WORST place t stay in midtown NYC. I would rather stay at the Bates Motel and take my chances of being killed than stay here again.An outlet did not work the bathroom mold was thick the faucet would not turn on there was garbage under the bed and we got a good room because we looked at 4 other rooms.

UR8108848,2007-12-July,Don't ever stay here! The hotel was horribly dirty and run down. Our first room had a dirty bathroom so we asked for it to be cleaned. The guy cleaned the shower with the toilet bowl brush then cleaned the toilet with the same brush then went back to the shower and cleaned it some more with the same brush. We switched rooms and I spent two hours cleaning it myself. It was so dirty that just wiping the counters turned the rag black. The matresses looked badly stained. Everyone was complaining in the lobby but the management did not care at all. It was one of the worst hotels I have ever stayed in!,teentravlr
UR7342526,2007-12-April,The filthiest hotel we have ever been to (not exagerating) The rudest staff on Earth. Debri falling from the ceiling. People getting infected with rushes over their bodies. Food in the cupboards. No room service unless you threaten them to death. Windows do not close. The lobby stinks like hell. 20 minutes average lift waiting time. No book of complains available. No hot water. Room telephone not working. No refund. They should all be in jail. Abdul S. Yakub is the manager although he denies it sometimes. If I had had time I would have gone to the nearest police station.,csolebra
UR10067206,2007-11-October,My advice to people is to give this sorry excuse for a hotel a miss. It was so bad in every way to much to mention. I have now read other reviews and can endorse all the bad ones. Be warned this a dirty smelly hotel with service non existence. Beware be very aware.,TravelhappyEngland
UR7588202,2007-11-May,Don't go to this hotel: there are bedbugs! It's so cheap that one does not expext any luxury but I do expect a simple clean and bug-free room. It was not clean there were clean sheets on the bed and that was it. The carpet was filthy and apparently had not been vaccuumed for weeks maybe months. I suffered severe allergy from the bedbug-bites so now 6 days after I left the hotel I am reminded of this terrible experience every minute of the day. My arms legs neck and face are red swollen and ithcy.,Ellen_M69
UR7330112,2007-11-April,The hotel looks nice from the outside but once you stepped inside it was very worn down. When we stepped out of the elevator on the 15`th floor the hall way looked misserable and was in desperate need of a home make over. The room was very dirty- the carpet could not have been cleaned for weeks. There were peaces of food toe nail clippings hair and pieces of paper on the carpet. The walls were cracked The radiator blasted out heat - there was about 30C int he room. The second night the roaches came out. When I talked to the hotel staff they just said: " welcome to new York" and "what do you want me to do about it?" I asked if they could vacuum the carpet - but they didnt. I did not get a discount. The location is great pretty much on times square. The price should be lower though considering what the room looked like. We just slept in the room  so we didnt have to spend that much time in it. We stayed in a youth hostel the first 4 nights and it was fabulous! Cleaned every day new towels and bed linnens every day our own kitchen and bathroom! Great loation and for less money! The youth hostel was a 100 times better than the hotel. / A from Sweden,SwedenA79
UR10064482,2007-10-October,I booked this hotel for two nights recently.Start with check in the lobby smelledthe staff was unresponsive.The rooms rug was not vacuumed in weekstrash under the bed paint peeling from the walls.The toilet seat was falling off.Tried to watch television picture was snowy.I checked the cable connection and found the problemthe connection was missing. The tile in the tub was full of mildew. The next day we expected to have clean sheets and towels.Went to the front desk to inquire and was told thay change the sheets every other day. There were several people at the desk demanding there money back to no avail. Stay away sleep in the park it will be cleaner..,worldtraveler10127
UR8603252,2007-1-September,If you have an enemy to whom you wish the worst in the word and in fact actually really hate.. you wouldnt even let him stay here.. It's terrible. Pictures say more then words,marktplaats22
UR7488055,2007-1-May,Like everyone looking at the horror stories in the reviews I was terrified to go to the Carter. My boyfriend was the one who booked it and when I saw the reviews I wanted to cancel and go to a hostel instead. The deal was we were 14 people going to New York to do a show. We decided we wanted to have our own private room with bathroom and be in a good spot. We couldn't afford anything else and the ones that we could afford were sold out so that's were the Carter's adventure begins... I bought vinyl covers took my own sheets took toileteries towels and flip flops to shower with Lysol wipes (prepared for the worst). There were 3 couples in the group and the rest were friends so we had a great time. Yes the place is not fancy at all as a matter of fact is tacky veryyy old and I could go on over the things that you have already read. I would not recomend it for a honey moon or romantic get away. But as a crash pad that's what we used it for it was perfect for the money we were going to stay two nights and then go to a friends house and we ended up staying there the whole time. The localization could not be better people who work there helped us with what we needed they even joked with us; the lobby smelled like fried bacon but you get use to it after a while (it has wireless and computers that you can rent for the hour) people staying there never bothered us the bathroom was clean it had some soaps the toilet leaked a little bit of water but you put a towel in the floor and will be fine and we had hot water. The bed was a king in my room. We didn't have any problems. Some of us got rooms that they didn't like but they have so many rooms that it was easy to switch from room to room. We ended up having a great time there I did't spend much time in the room anyway. If you're going there to sleep shower and get ready to go out is perfect some of the people that I went with spend time there even took naps and watch some games in TV. So what if they have the worst taste ever decorating the place they never changed our sheets or did our beds at least nothing got stolen never saw an isect didn't felt bed bugs. Under the same conditions would stay there again. We Did the best out of it actually we joke about making I Love Hotel Carter T Shirts ...but then you should have in mind that we are Puertoricans we tend to do a party out of everything.,HappycamperSanJuan
UR4447501,2006-8-February,The only good thing about the place was that the bed was comfy. Shame as the building is great and a refurb would make the hotel FAB! Location is perfect.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR6347899,2006-8-December,Ugh we just got in from New York staying at Hotel Carter on W 43rd Street. We've been going to NY for 6 years and have never experienced a "HOTEL" like this. I read many reviews on it before I booked and it just seemed to be "you get what you pay for" and $150 per night is VERY appealing especially for the location. The room was fine it was warm and had 2 king sized beds. It was a little tacky looking and the walls were dirty but it was a place to sleep. The bathroom was clean also but our toilet would NOT flush properly the whole time. NOW onto the more important things. We had things stolen from our room. 2 of my mothers medications came up missing. We tore the room apart trying to find them! And they were not in there. We informed the front desk and asked them to call the police. They said "No YOU call the police." The next day in the lobby we spoke to another gues who had things stolen from her room. We called the police to file a report. He told us he has had 1000's of reports filed due to theft there. While we were speaking to the officer another guest came up and said a $350 game was stolen from his room also. You WILL be disappointed if you stay here. I am very surprised to see not ONE review mentioning theft. Unbelievable. We left a night early. This place should be SHUT DOWN!!!!!! LOUSY customer service they just do NOT care! Save yourself the trouble and do NOT STAY HERE.,ginabina1440
UR5577575,2006-8-August,I went to New York with my uni friend and found a hotel to stay in however I had a last look to see if I could find a cheaper hotel...........and that lead me to booking the dump that is the Carter Hotel. The appearance of our first room 2was very dingy but manageable. That was until the following morning........ I woke up about 7am and heard something scuttering by a large bag of american 'chips' I had brought. I was too scared to move....when I coulodn't hear it anym9ore I got out of bed and looked on the floor there were mouse droppings and my bag of american chips had been opened by a mouse tearing at the bag and some of the crisps had been eaten too! I went straight down to reception and the receptionists reply was " oh yes didn't we tell you we had a mice problem when you checked in?". We then changed rooms. Our second room was much bigger but far more dirtier. One of the windows had been broken and boarded up with a very thin piece of cardboard! The best part was the thin piece of cardboard didnt fit the window frame so where the gaps were it had been stuffed with tissue! Some nights was very cold! The receptionist also told me to put any food into a carrier bag and hang it from the door handle so the mice couldn't eat it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I know it was a low budget hotel but for that you still expect cleanliness safety and happy staff. My friend and I did not let the hotel ruin our five day break in New York we hadn't enough money to go elsewhere so had to stay for the duration. We managed to cope there and can now laugh at it and put it down to experience! And what an experience it was! Even being on a student budget I would never ever stay there again and I strongly advise anyvbody who reads this not to go. I'd say the only good thing about the hotel is the location - that was perfect - 30seconds from the heart of Times Square!,Lil_Miss_Nawty
UR5924857,2006-7-October,This was by far the worst hotel ive ever stayed in and i have stayed in many budget hotels across the world. Me and my friend had jst finished a summer of working and flown in from Las Vegas on a late flight. We stated on our booking form we would arrive late. We arrived at 10:30. The lady at reception advised us we'd have to wait for someone to come and check us in....15 minutes later she herself told us our room had gone. There was one room left in the whole hotel. We went ahead and booked this room. As we were checking in a group of what can only be described as 'gangstas' haha walked in and started causing trouble and had to be threatened with the police to leave. We finally made it up to the 14th floor. As soon as the lift door opened we saw that all the hotel room doors on that floor appeared to have been kicked in they had all been battered. We got to our room which wasnt nice atall. I think the soap and toilet roll were antique. There was a breeze constantly blowing through our room quite eerie really. I agree with the previous person who reviewed this that said the shower was like being hosed by riot police couldnt of described it better myself. The bathroom looked like something out of psycho. There was hardly any ventilation in the room. Also all the time we were there we were very unhappy about leaving our bags - laptops cameras ipods etc in our room due to the state of the corridor. The doors of the hotel room wernt very reassuring as there were FOUR bolts on our door. We put every single one on. The staff were unhelpful the reception was waterlogged u sunk into it. We met some australians in the lift whos first words 'so is your room as bad as ours?' Do not stay there this place definately needs shutting down or taking over shame that such a good location is going to waste because in some ways this did spoil our New York experience.,sineaduk
UR6334339,2006-5-December,Upon checking in we paid for our room dropped off our bags and ran to the show we had tickets for in New York City. When we returned and settled in the room after mid-night we looked around and began to feel uncomfortable. There were six large nails and sharp pieces of metal sticking out of the wall no phone no clock no towels the bed was not made there was not a light when entering the room there were no fire alarms and the conditions of the room and bathroom were completely un-safe un-sanitary and non-habitable. We quickly grabbed our things and headed to the front desk. They would not allow us to get our money back because it was after mid-night. We explained that we checked in and then ran off to the show and when we returned we were astonished with the conditions of the room. The staff and then the manager were very rude and would not communicate with us. I am assuming they must deal with this all the time due to the condition of the room and their behavior. I have never fought a charge before but this time I called my credit card right away! With the condition of that room #909 the hotel needs to be at the minimum inspected by the state or in my opinion: CLOSED DOWN.,Travel_Minute
UR4413095,2006-4-February,I stayed at this hotel a few years ago with some friends and according to the recent reviews it hasn't changed. The front desk is enclosed with a glass barrier and the staff are very rude and unhelpful. The rooms are very dirty and the beds uncomfortable. The worst thing though was that one of my friend's belongings were stolen by a hotel employee - yes everything; clothes toiletries passport the lot. They just left his empty suitcase in the room and locked the door behind them. The front desk were not interested so we had to call the police who got nowhere with the staff either. The police said that they were frequently called to this hotel for one reason or another. Even if you're on a very tight budget do not stay here really.,Paul38
UR6029708,2006-31-October,This hotels location was excellent the state of the rooms was as expected as we read previous reviews so we were not expecting anything special. We stayed there for 7 nights and they only cleaned our room once after asking them repeatedly. What we did not count on was catching bedbugs. We saw some bedbugs on the day we left and since then we have been eaten alive. We we are now staying with friends and are at risk of infecting there house as well. Be warned!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,mikey351
UR6308703,2006-30-November,After waiting too long to decide where to stay we kind of had no choice for the money we wanted to spend. Everything else that the other people are saying in the reviews is true. In our room I saw 2 2" cockroaches. Our view was of the walls of the next building. The bathroom wasn't very clean; the air-conditioner was all beat up (the heat was so high that we had to use the ac); and it was generally in poor condition. Nobody ever came to clean or change towels or anything. No washcloth was given just some towels. Lots of cheap soap no shampoo. Would we stay there again? I guess if we had to since we loved the city and didn't spend much time in the hotel. Now those memories are funny for us. The location is great; but next time we're looking elsewhere first.,charaudeau
UR4822630,2006-30-March,I traveled to NYC as part of a tour trip and we stayed at the Hotel Carter to save money. Yea it's great that we were only a block from Times Square but it wasn't worth it. Walking in I could have sworn that we were in a movie theater not a hotel. The elevator was rickety but I'm pretty sure there weren't any stairs in the building. When we first got to our room we opened the door and instantly thought it was still occupied because it hadn't been cleaned yet. The doors looked as if they could be broken in. The room was tiny and the bathroom door didn't work. The phone and TV did not work. When we peeled back the sheets of the bed we found them stained and covered in hair. Another room had a hole in the bed that looked like it had been chewed by a rodent of some kind. Some of the rooms didn't have bulb covers on the lights and I was positive the bulb was going to fall onto us while we slept. The hotel was a hole and I greatly looked forward to sleeping on the floor of the next place we stayed. I wouldn't recommend this hotel to my worst enemy.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR5030504,2006-3-May,Well what can you say about the Hotel Carter that hasn't already been said? The place is a dump. However i have stayed there at least a half-dozen times over the past few years and would probably go back again given the necessity. The hotel is perfectly situated about a half block from the heart of Times Square with resturaunts and Subway stations near-by. There is also a great little Deli on the ground floor where you can get pretty decent food and the price is hundreds less than you would pay at other hotels in that area. Make no mistake: Hotel Carter is NOT for the faint of heart. I have never stayed in a room there that didn't have problems and i HAVE encountered needles and condoms in the stairwell (which i was only "exploring" because the elevator didn't work). None-the-less if you are on a tight budget (or just don't care that much about where you sleep at night) you might want to give The Hotel Carter a look.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR4320314,2006-3-January,I am writing my review in an effort to deter at least one person from staying here. This was the worst hotel I have ever been in. Let me start off by saying when I checked in with my reservation confirmation in hand they told me they did NOT have my reservation. Upon making entry into the room I noticed the dry wall was dripping on the ceiling. The room smelled like an animal had died in there. The bedspread if you can call it that had FLUID stains on it. The bed sheets had what appeared to be a blood stain. The carpeting was filthy. I entered the bathroom and found unfinished plumbing. The drains failed to do that....drain. The shower fixtures were MISSING not to mention the shower rod was being held up by a rubberband....that's right folks a RUBBERBAND. During our FIVE night stay the rooms were never cleaned the sheets were never changed and we had to REQUEST towels ..... which by the way were handed to us DIRTY. During our entire stay we only observed a five person work crew to include the three rude people at check-in. To conclude Our trip to NYC was as advertised however I would never recommend the Hotel Carter to anyone. This hotel needs to be demolished and rebuilt under new management.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR6321816,2006-3-December,Upon arrival at the hotel we had paid in cash and made our way to the room .When we opened the door we nearly collasped with fright. The room was dirty window broke  toilet blockedpaint falling off the wallsand smelly mould all over. We had two children with us and they were frightened.It was our first night in new york and it was late but i knew it would have been safer to stay in central park with a newspaper over my head. We met with fellow guests who all had the same story had paid cash and couldnt get it backand had been complaining and was getting nowhere. We went to reception and complained and was offered another room with was worst than the one we had.Eventually after a long argument with the woman at the desk the money was given back to me. We had stood our ground and refused to leave without our moneyand she knew we were not going to go easily so she backed down.I felt sorry for some of the other guests as they were not so lucky in getting there money back and there were that bit younger than us so i think they were taken advantage of.Never ever stay there,Corkonians
UR5891811,2006-29-September,For Sale!! T-Shirts "We Survived A Stay At The Hotel Carter!" Price: $15.99 US Sizes: XSSMLXL So we were referred to Hotel Carter by a friend of a friend. We are not speaking to them anymore. When we arrived at the hotel at 8:30pm we weren't sure they would honour our reservation. Finally we received a key to a room. We schlepped our bags up to the room I opened the door to find that someone else was occupying that room. After another trip to reception we got a key to a room of our own. ( See picture - You will notice it is much different than the ones on the website). And what a room it was! Very scary. Too bad they haven't invented "smellorama" for the internet. Room service was a chinese restaurant. No really. The plaster was coming off the walls so it 'snowed' plaster on us in the shower and next to my bed. As you will see from the blurry picture attached there was a lovely wad of gum stuck to the wall next to Anna's nightstand. Take it away Anna! I'm disappointed not only in the hotel but in the name. Why Hotel Carter? Jimmy Carter is a great man a fine president who builds homes for those in need. Why not Hotel Nixon? Or Hotel Bush? Now those are names that illustrate the depravity the false pretense the let-downs the stink of this hotel.,SurvivorRoom305
UR6305372,2006-29-November,This Hotel is living a horrorshow!! After the first night I wook up my arms and forhead were covered with big red bumps! It looked really scary!! I bitten al over by these bed-bugs. Really disgusting!!! The bumps started to get bigger and more red. After 15 weeks they were slowly going away. Trust me do NOT go to this hotel!! Besides the bed-bugs it is really filty and customerservice is something they never heard of.,PAX999
UR4739223,2006-28-March,Where do I begin...O.K. I am a recent college graduate so keep in mind that on the previous five spring breaks I have attended I have stayed in some pretty nasty dumps...THIS IS THE WORST OF ALL! First they charge you for room keys (I thought when you rented a hotel room you get a key with the room charge???) I didn't mind the fact the building was old but it definately didn't look safe or like it would pass any fire code. On the way up to the rooms we passed many doors which had been punched in. Then as we got closer to our room a room full of about ten or more very young looking girls dressed rather "escortish" asked if we were moving in next door!!! What people move into this hotel on a regular basis apparently. Once we told her no all she said was well brace yourselves then...Needless to say I didn't feel comfortable there what-so-ever. I didn't even want to leave my belongings there to eat some dinner after I had been on planes for almost twelve hours; with long layovers plane changes and delays. As far as I am concerned unless you are used to staying at hotels that rent by the hour or are located in a third world country you would not feel safe leaving your belongings in this place let alone sleeping there.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR4565160,2006-28-February,Last december they had over booked the hotel. We queued for two hours to get to a dirty room where there was not sheets enough. And we were lucky not to get a completely destroyed room with flees. Some rooms had people already staying in them. In one room the window was broken. A total nightmare.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR6181314,2006-27-November,This has to be the worst run hotel ever calling it Fawlty Towers would insult Basil Fawlty. We arrived at 17.00 were told our room was not ready. At 21.30 we still did not have a room in this time many people had come down from there room to give out about the dirt on the sheets broken doors/TV's. The List was endless. Finally at 21.30 we were told that we would be getting no room no reason just they could not give us a room. This was our first night in New York we did not have a clue where we were going and got absolutly no help from the Staff if you could call them that. We had only held the room on Visa so did not pay but out of the 40 or so people there that were told they had no room many had paid in full for the hotel and were just left stranded. It may be central but everywhere in New York it is worth paying an extra few quid and going over a few blocks. I have backpacked a lot and have no problen staying in cheap accomadation but this place was an absolute disgrace,Cotsy
UR5835081,2006-25-September,Well check in was ok paid cash up front and got a paper recipt...hmmm. A deposit is required for the room key but you do not get it back when you leave. The room was renovated...probly 1979 I'd estimate. Paint peeling off the walls...where they were not carpeted. The sheets appeared clean the blanket ended up on the floor quickly. The bathroom would give Oscar the Grouch the hebbie geebies. The shower was like being hosed by riot police. There was a new hotel comfot feature I have never experienced. They provide exfoliating towels! I rigged the door when I left for the day and it looked as though some one was in the room. Certainly not house keeping. We had one poor signal channel on the TV...cartoons. There is a parking garage across the street and if you go one block to the east side there are good resturaunts and a reasonable liqour store. Like they say great location great price. My advice...great place to crash with "the boys" not a place to take a lady. Spend the money on a better place...,Dr._Who2
UR5829614,2006-23-September,I knew we had made a bad decision on booking the hotel the moment we stepped foot into the place. The reception area ( i don't even know if we can call it that) was dark there were stains on the walls shady people standing around watching us and rude workers. The worker at the front desk literally grabbed our money and threw us the key. while waiting in line to check in there was a woman who was complaining about her showerhead which broke and fell on her while she was showering!!! Graffiti in the halls and all over the doors and walls. We saw an old man.... literally 90 years old...who worked at the hotel trying to sweep. was that housekeeping? The rooms were no different from the nasty reception area. Weird rugs stappled to the walls one single lightbulb with a chain hanging from the ceiling. we were on an upper floor and there was no screen on the window to prevent anyone from jumping out . the sink had mismatched handles and there was mysterious water on the floor before anyone had used the bathroom. toilet paper was half used when we got there. very clear that the rooms don't get cleaned after they are used. how is this hotel still in business????????? right when walking into the room we observed that our stained bed was half made. The walls were stained with dead bugs and yellow and black marks. i stood on the bed with sandals in order to change my clothes. after about one hour in the room we had enough. it was very funny walking out of the hotel with our luggage and seeing the terrified looks of the people checking in.,sbstudent
UR6002193,2006-23-October,I understand that you get what you pay for and for less than a hundred dollars a night near Times Square my expectations were very low. They should have been lower. The room was disgusting: pizza crusts and pisctachio shells everywhere stains on the sheets no maid service for four days but the worst was getting scammed by the staff. They are all very rude to begin with but one night a friend decided to stay with us in our room at two thirty in the morning the front door guard banged on the door and said we had to pay him $20 for the fourth guest or get out of the room. He wouldn't leave until we paid him the money. Stay at a hostel or a YMCA for the same price or cheaper,Brantman1
UR5494445,2006-21-July,I could not believe that there was a place like this. Absolutely disgusting and horrible. At the reception my fears started to get rreal. The door to the room was really bad and allthough the room was ok one of the beds had a big red/brown stain on it. The Aircon at the window didnt work in fact the window was leaking so we almost frozed to death during the nights. Had to sleep with jeans socks and a hat. Showerdrain was stuck so the water wouldnt empty. Toilet was leaking whe we flushed. After we arrived from our first night out on town the police was about to storm the second floor. Shared the elevator with four och NYPDs finest. WARNING!!!,mrvain
UR5630769,2006-21-August,OK its a cheap hotel but over here in the UK even a cheap cheap cheap hotel would come with clean linen towels a working telephone and windows that acually lock. Also we would experiance the 'delight' of a clean flushing toilet and clean shower/bath to wash in. A legal reauirement is also that the rooms must have smoke detectors in them plus an alarm at least outside the room to alert you that the place is on fire! Obvioulsy the Hotel Carter owners have never been to the UK or infact any other hotel! This place is quite shocking and would not look out of place in a hammer house of horror movie. If you are travelling as part of a large group (safety in numbers) and you have no regard to your safety and you sleep in a sleeping bag and wash yourself with baby wipes and go to one of the local eateries to use the toilet I still would not recommend this place.

UR6475810,2006-20-December,Checking in to this hotel was like stepping into a Sci-Fi experience. The decor is like a bad 80s movie set-design. The bullet-proof glass at the front-desk is a clear indication of the service you will receive. If you make your reservations online do not expect them to have the reservation when you get there it's a cover up to their lack of technology. We get there and they asked us what rate we are supposed to pay. WHAT! We get to the room and had 2 double beds which was fine. But the TV was dirty ashes in the dresser drawer empty soda cans on the floor in a corner the window was open and the AC did not work. The closet was a large open space with a couple of wire hangers and a couple of plastic ones. (See photo). The bathroom lightbulb was 40 watts. I had to use my digital camera to get a look at what I was stepping into. (See photo). We were scared to take showers in this place and would not dare use the washcloths on our privates for fear of rash. My friend got checked into someone elses room and walked in on a naked man who was terrified. We all decided that we would stay up all night because no one wanted to lay in those beds and close our eyes for any length of time in there. Don't walk to halls alone was the advise I got from a local I spoke to in the elevator. "This place used to be a body spot back in the day". "A body spot?" I asked. "Yeah they used to dump bodies here." So I wanted to get the hell out of there asap. My friends decided that I can not ever recommend another hotel. The sad part is I have a degree in hospitality. The only good thing is that you really can do WHATEVER you want in that hotel. Smoke drink party and whatever else. No one had anything to say because no one cared.,TiffLife
UR4364745,2006-19-January,We stayed in the carter over new year 2005/6. yes it is run down and could do with a make over but the bed linen and towels were clean and fresh the shower was hot and water plentiful housekeeping came round to change the sheets etc. the room was small and a little scruffy but the location is brilliant. what do people expect at this price in New york? so we only had 3 TV channels and no shampoo etc in the rooms big deal.I have stayed in worse hotels in the Uk you do not go to NY to stay in your hotel room.,beastie69
UR5625672,2006-19-August,We booked a room through the hotel website. The impression given was of a reasonably priced budget hotel. Our first impression when we arrived was of rude and very unhelpful staff at the front desk. After the money was snapped out of my hand the key was thrown at me and we went to our room. Imagine our surprise to find someone was already in there. We went down to tell them and had to join a very long queue of people complaining. They gave us another room which had a very dodgy lock. The shower was an absolute disgrace and i would not wash an animal in it for fear they caught something. The website stated panoramic views of times square all our view consisted of was a brick wall. All in all a complete disgrace and should be shut down immediately.The only saving was a man called Mr Abdullah who seemed to understand what a dump the place was and tried to help as much as possible. I only hope this person has now got a better job someplace else.,deluca
UR4989331,2006-19-April,It is a really old building just off of Times Square. Great location the blue ACE trains were a 1/2 block one way and Times Square station was a 1/2 block the other way. The hotel was old but the room was small but nice. Nice king bed very clean bathroom awesome view from the 17th floor of the New York skyline and the George Washington bridge. It goes downhill from there though. The TV was old and most channels didn't come in well at all. there were people fixing the street and the jackhammers started early in the morning. We didn't get maid service until the Tuesday after having checked in on Saturday and that was only after I complained twice though we did get maid service each day after until we checked out on Sunday. On Thursday night when we came back the water in the entire hotel was off. We couldn't even flush the toilet! Luckily we didn't get in until late that night and were leaving early in the morning to see Conan. The hotel was giving away bottled water to make up for the inconvenience. When we got back on Friday afternoon the water problem was fixed but water was then leaking from the ceiling onto the bed. Luckily they fixed the problem and ti was dry by that night. So despite all of that craziness I would probably still stay there again. I would hope that most of those problems were isolated to when we were there but still I would put up with them rather than pay double to stay anywhere else in midtown.,Robden

UR5475846,2006-17-July,I stayed here while on a church trip to the city. It was a group or 29 highschoolers and adults so we needed someplace cheap to stay. The hotel was discusting. We got there and found our rooms. Our room (me along with 3 other girls) was on the 6th floor and the rest of our group was on the 8th floor so they moved us up there. We got to our 8th floor room and my friend sat on her bed and it broke. One corner of it just fell too the floor. So I just kidding said "lets make it even" so i sat on the other side and it broke! The bed was now on an incline. My bed tilted to the side. So the people at the dest told us that they would fix our beds that night and moved us up again to the 11th floor. One girl was taking a shower in our 11th floor room (all the bathtubs are painted white with wall paint which chips off) and the shower head fell off. So the next morning we went back down to our 8th floor room and.....the beds weren't fixed! We got some of the boys with us to take the bed frame out from under the bed because the girls were afraid to sleep on it broken. The door to the bathroom was too big for the doorframe and didn't shut. There weren't any smoke detectors in any of the rooms only one in the hallway next to the elevators. One boy from our group got body lice from the hotel! There were seamen stains on sheets so I slept in my sleeping bag that I'd needed for the first part of our trip and others used their own sheets. My friend's pillow even said "Radisson Hotel" on it. One night we requested a extension cord so we could plug in the air conditioner and they gave us one but it was burnt out on one end. The hotel owners were rude even though they did move our room twice. DO NOT STAY IN THIS HOTEL! It is unhealthy and definately unsafe. A nicer hotel is worth the extra couple of hundred dollars.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR4357686,2006-17-January,I had read the reviews on the Carter Hotel when looking at staying in New York yet I still went ahead and booked it. I thought that maybe some people were just too picky... but the reviews were right. All reviews I had read stated that this hotel is in a fantastic location - right in Times Square and in the middle of the action but the hotel itself was awful. The other hotels we looked at online were so expensive so the Carter Hotel was a good cheap option. When we arrived flashbacks of the reviews I read came instanly to mind. I thought.. I should have believed them. The staff at the hotel are extremely rude and abrupt. It took about 20 mins of standing at the reception desk for someone to acklowedge our existence - there were 4 people behind the desk who continuely ignored us. We finally got checked in by the rudest most arrogant woman on the planet. We finally got to our room and yes it was awful. Actually it was totally disgusting. We ended up asking for another room and the arrogant woman on reception actually let us choose from another 2 rooms (she must have had a weak moment). The final room we chose - being the best of the 3 - was fairly good if you like blood stains on the quilts cracks & dints in the walls a tv that only had 2 stations that worked (the tv's in the other rooms didn't work at all - so 2 stations was a bonus) the bathroom door didn't fit to the frame - so you it didn't close the toilet spat out water from the pipes when flushed the tap in the shower fell off every time you touched it there was mould all over the bathroom the towels were extremely thin and about the size of a hand towel the sheets on the bed were stained with who knows what - I tried not to think about it the walls are very thin (so if you're planning a fun time in NY remember your neighbour can here everything you do) our room was serviced once in a 5 day period (luckily we had pinched the toilet paper and extra towels from the other rooms when we were trying to pick a room).. the list goes on and on. The hotel has a tour desk with some chick that can't speak english and is happy to try and ignore you. But when you bug her enough she'll throw a couple of brochures at you and then pretend you vanished into thin air. Such a friendly little thing she was - NOT!! My suggestion - go find a tourist information centre somewhere else in New York. This was just too hard. In the end we tried to look on the bright side and spent most of the days out seeing the sights. We only went to the room to sleep (or tried to in between neighbours enjoying themselves). We tried to see it as the glass is half full...we had a roof over our head a half-comfortable bed to sleep in and being the middle of winter & freezing cold we were warm (cause we wore two layers to bed). The price of the hotel was cheap (compared to other hotels) and we were in the heart of the action. It sure was an experience. If you do decide to stay here you really need to be open to adventure and ready for an experience of a lifetime :-),Opanook
UR4982753,2006-17-April,We planned to stay in this hotel for two nights in september but after checking in we soon changed our minds! Every hotel was booked out in New York for the nights we needed because George Bush was in town but even that didnt stop us demanding a refund and leaving the Carter hotel. When we checked in at 12 pm we were allocated a room and told it may not be serviced but to go on up and it would be serviced as soon as possible. i work in a hotel and to me this seemed crazy! checking somebody in to an unserviced rooms is madness how do they know that there arnet dirty needlees or used condoms still in the room!. When we got to the room the bed had been slept in and the bathroom clearly had been used so we left our stuff in the corner adivsed reception we wanted our room serviced asap and left to go out for the day. When we returned at 7.00 that evening our room was still not serviced. We demanded to change rooms but when they showed us the 2nd room it was worse than the first it had been serviced but the bathroom was flithy and the bed sheets dirty. The more we looked around the hotel the worse it got broken fire exit signs rubbish strewn all over the place live cables hanging out of plug sockets and 10 + guests talking in recpetion about the rat problem! apart from that the whole hotel smelt like a dodgy kebab house and the manager was walikng around with his shoes off drunk threatening to throw guests out who dared to complain! The staff are unbelievably rude i have never seen anything like it and cannot understand how this hotel functions!. when we went to get our refund and check out there must have been 50 guests in reception doing the same thing. We eneded up staying in a dodgy motel in Chelsea but it was a major improvement on the carter. i would not recommend this hotel to anyone under any circumstances. Please do not give your money to this hotel! it maybe cheap but who knows what you would encounter if you stayed the night there!,traceyf
UR4627115,2006-16-March,we had booked to stay in the hotel carter when i looked it up on the web and saw what the rooms were like we couldnt stay. we had booked it for 14 nightswe are so glad that we looked here first before we went as it would of ruined our holiday. if anyone is wanting to stay here dont change your resevations like me,A TripAdvisor Member
UR6134523,2006-15-November,I booked this hotel before reading the reviews. My wife however read them afterwards and demanded I cancel the booking and find somewhere else which I did. Out of curiousity we went to look at Hotel Carter at 10:30pm just to see for ourselves just how bad it was. I can still see the expression on my wife's face as we entered the lobby. "What a delight this is" she sarcastically said. 'Shame we cancelled!! (Ha! Ha!) It has the most interesting decor I have ever seen! The walls are covered in green carpet??!! The 'floor' carpet was filthy and sticky and there was a gathering of dirty smelly tramps sat on the sofa's drinking meth's!! There was also a stack of breeze blocks to sit on if you chose not to sit by the dirty smelly tramps. The place had a strange pungent aroma it would be unfair to blame the tramps for this!!! We spoke to a couple who was staying there and they informed us that public toilets were cleaner than the rooms and that they couldn't wait to leave.,Boyofromcymru
UR6447427,2006-15-December,I stayed at this hotel last weekend for one night and if it had been any longer I would not have stayed if it were for free. The room was filthy with no toiletries. The staff is extremely unprofessional and not concerned with guests safety. There is a huge huge theft problem here. During our stay several guests had items stolen one woman had all of her luggage stolen. All of it. I read some of the other reviews about it being worth it in order to save money to spend but seriously its' not. I have two children and if they were with me I would have walked right back out the door. Avoid this hotel at all costs it's not worth the extra money you save trust me.,zizzer
UR5614180,2006-15-August,It was all I could afford and it was fine. I didn't encounter any of the problems others wrote about but did feel a little nervous. I'd agree with the reviewer who wrote it wasn't for the faint of heart. But if you need someplace to sleep in NYC and don't have a lot of money then it is fine.,virving
UR5799744,2006-14-September,I stayed in Hotel Carter in October 2004. It was bad. The room was dirty the bathroom was dirty the lobby was dirty. The desk staff were rude and the whole hotel smelt horrible. I am writing this because I see that 2 years on with countless more awful reviews people are still staying at the Hotel. I don't understand why. I didn't know about trip advisor before my stay I wish I had done! If you read this before you book I would stronly recommend that you look elsewhere. Some people say "but the price is amazing and the location is ace". Trust me this does not make up for the astonishing shockingly awful condition of this place. I really don't understand how it hasn't been shut down.,Sonich60
UR4974594,2006-14-April,My husband and I used to live in NYC but have sinced moved. We got tix to a show at Madison Square and needed a place to crash at the last minute. We booked because the hotel was about $300 cheaper than any other hotel we could find and the location was central. We walked into a lobby that looked like a transit hub to purgatory. Lots of people complaining of overbooked rooms. One guy was yelling that he paid for a single room but was now sharing it with at least 2 rats. A tour group that just flew in from Omaha and looked shell shocked. Our room was pretty shoddy but functional. We were only there for one night so it wasn't too bad for the price and location. We've both traveled extensively in 3rd world countries so the old musty sheets worn carpeting and hole in the bathroom wall didn't disturb us too much. I would not recommend this place for extended stays or if you plan on keeping anything of value in the room.,tk211
UR4455982,2006-13-February,I'm a girl from Germany and I stayed at Hotel Carter in Sept 2005 for 5 nights. It was the most awful experience regarding hotels that I have ever made in my life and I have travelled quite a lot. When I arrived they gave me a key to a room that was still occupied by someone. The room stank as if someone had thrown up and it stank of cigarettes too. The room was a total mess with filthy clothes everywhere. I thought "oh my god do they always give the keys to a room that is occupied ? Will someone march into my room the next time ?" The next room which I then stayed in was also filthy there was no furniture in it that was not broken. There was a small cuboard where you could put your clothes and there was a big brown sticky puddle on the floor the size of a car tire. During my stay (5 nights) my room was not even made once ! I had to ask for toilet paper at the reception. But the most awful thing was: there was no water for 2 complete days and nights. You can imagine what the toilet in my bathroom looked like after one day. It was only on the second day that we received water bottles to wash ourselves the whole place stank and everybody was complaining and screaming in the lobby about the missing water. It was 35 degrees Celcius outside and you could not shower ! Every time I asked at the reception when the water would come back they told me "within one hour" and this kept on going for 2 days I really was angry. The problem with this place is: there is some kind of really bad energy in that hotel. I think everyone who stayed there will confirm this. I could not sleep at night because of the smell and the filth and I was afraid of the things underneath my bed. I had a look underneath my bed and saw so many filth dirty tissues and strange black things I could not identify that I decided not to look further. I did not have a bedlight anyway only a naked bulb at the ceiling.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR5946601,2006-12-October,I will say the positives first: PRIME tourist location and the sheets looked clean. Now the negatives like a reviewer below I feel I survived this stay. It was only for one night but 2 days later I still am shocked that i stayed there. Yes it is for the budget minded traveler and yes it said it was only 1 star but I have stayed at better motels that were truly for the budget-minded. Upon entry you are assaulted with odors from the adjoining deli- falafels and fried grease is what it smells like. Then the carpet throughout doesn't look like it's been vacuumed in ages. The decor is a whole other story- tacky but besides the point. The lobby is smelly and dingy and everything is severely old and messy looking. The front desk clerk was friendly and they did hold my bags after check out. The elevators smelled of vinegar. The walls of the building were covered in carpet that has been tacked on and the dust threw my allergies into overdrive. pipes are exposed throughout. The room's walls are very dirty. The tv is old and has maybe 2 channels that are fuzzy. The view from my room was a wall. I didn't want to walk around barefoot that's how dirty it looked. The bathroom was so old that the tub had 4 knobs for the water and only 2 worked so in the end all i could get was hot water out of the bath and not through the shower head. it looked so dirty i bought a bath mat. there were dead gnats in the tub when i got there. I was prepared for something bare bones but what I got was a seedy looking hotel in a great are. Stay away if you can! Try priceline and hope for something better!,PrboogieTravels
UR4602181,2006-12-March,Okay lets start off hotels in NYC are expensive I stayed here with my travel group because it was pretty cheap. However if you are unable to deal with some less that desirable conditions stay somewhere else. The ceiling in the front lobby was dripping water in one of the rooms the bathroom door wouldn't shut because it didn't fit into the door frame we found a used condom in one room and a pair of pants in another a chunk of ceiling plaster fell on my friend when she was getting out of the shower there was only one channel on the TV and I don't think it had sound rat poison under the beds in all rooms my group stayed in. All of this sounds bad but we took it all in stide and joked about it. But what do you expect? Its $100 a room just steps from Times Square! I saved my money to go to Broadway shows and great shopping not to stay in a fancy hotel that I'm only going to spend few waking hours in. Despite its drawbacks the hotel is popular we got rooms there without reservations because our other accomidations fell through all but three rooms were booked so we had to fit 12 people in 3 rooms thats 4 to a king sized bed. It was a tad annoying then but we all joke about it now. And honestly I think it was a good experience I definately appriciate nicer hotels now and on a student's budget I would probably end up staying there again.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR5329665,2006-10-June,We weren't expecting much for $99 a night in NYC but please! The bathroom had a dead cockroach when we arrived. The plug in the bathroom was broken and the only other one was where the TV with 3 channels was plugged in to. The "concierge" was useless. Our smoke detector was in the drawer with the battery laying beside it. The kicker was when I requested towels since there is no maid service and the clerk behind the desk told me he hated me as he headed off to get the towels using a few choice profanities for my group. Your taking your chances for sure. The best is they send an email hoping they met all your expectations. HA!,A TripAdvisor Member
UR4450462,2006-10-February,Just a note to say that i stayed in Hotel Carter for one night as i couldn't spend another night in it. Its a nightmare! The place smells of grease due to the fact there is a kebab shop almost in the lobby. Also the rooms are just vile i actually have never experienced anything like it in my life.This is the third hotel i've stayed in New york and i know some of the hotels can be a bit run down but this is just ridiculous.The covers looked filty i ended up sleeping on my towels instead.The paint is peeling off all the walls. And the lift is constantly breaking down. The staff aren't that friendly but in all fairness i wouldn't be smiling either if i had to work there. I know its cheap and the location in great but i don't think its worth the hassle.Its well worth spending the extra bit of cash to get a slightly more expensive hotel you'll be comfortable in.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3452693,2005-9-May,This is by far the worst hotel you coud ever stay in!!!!!....I found tampon wrappers dirty underwear and pills in my room....The air conditioner didnt work they didnt offer any ammenities....not that I would use anything in that hotel!!!!!!!!!!!!!can you say grosssssss!!!!!!!i had to go to a convenient store to buy ice to keep my kids drinks cold....the staff is incredibly rude also.........please beware!!!!!hotel carter is by far the dirtiest.....trust me dont be cheap spend the money on a name hotel....you wont regret it!!!!!,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3261403,2005-9-March,We visited NY in October 2004 when we got there the first bad thing happened - there weren't enough beds for us all to have one each! We therefore had to spend the next three nights sharing a bed with at least one other person sometimes more. When we first got inside our room (on the very top floor) we found pubic hair in the bath (which didnt run properly) rubbish under the bed mouldy food and it was freezing as the windows did not fit the wall! Some of our friends found nail clippings in their bed sheets some had blood stains. In the room next to ours a girl found a used condom in the drawer! On our second day all the toilets blocked on our floor - so no one could go to the toilet all morning. As the bath didn't work we couldn't wash our hair so we had to wash it over a tiny sink the size of a dinner plate. And to top it all off we had a policeman knock on our door to tell us to be careful of drug dealers residing in the hotel! On our last day we thought it would be over however the shower broke in another guest's room and we had to rush our luggage through a large puddle of water to get to the lift at 7.30 in the morning! By the way the lift had dried up sick in the corner! Not pleasant. even if you are looking for a budget hotel with a great location - this place is not worth it. It was an experience but one we'd rather forget! Sorry about the photos - they are a bit wobbly but it was had to concentrate with all the crap that was happening around us!,moose000
UR3650536,2005-9-July,We knew this was a cheap room and we were only staying for a couple of nights. Upon walking in we noticed a table with a paper taped on it that said 'Security Desk.' I never saw 'Security' the whole time. We then entered the rope lighted cheap persian-rugged lobby to a bullet proof window. There wasn't a line but we did pay $1 for a room key which I've never heard of. The staff wasn't rude but they weren't exactly pleasant either. We entered the elevator to see 'This hotel ----!' written on the door. Upon entering our first room I couldn't speak that is until I entered the bathroom. The window had a huge hole where I guess someone had broken it out - Thank Goodness. So we went downstairs where the lady nicely changed us to another room saying that our first room was on her 'okay' list. Apparently they have lists of the decent and not-so-decent rooms. Our next room was better. All of the windows were in the sheets were clean and there was new tile in the bathroom. Everything else was old and there were fire alarms in the bottom drawer of the chest. Yes our air conditioner was plugged into an extension cord that we had to drag across the room to plug in but it worked. We never saw any mice and only a couple of bugs-not roaches. Bring your own towels shampoos soaps and cleaning wipes (for your personal sanity in the bathroom!). You just have to laugh and remember it's only a place to shower and sleep. It will grow on you if you take that attitude.,snowmom24
UR2992029,2005-9-January,Stayed at the hotel over New Year's eve. While I did not expect much I did have a pleasant experience. Saw the ball drop. I did not come to the hotel expecting much. Basic was what I was looking for and that is what I got. Planning another trip this year. Oh yes if you go there ask for rooms above 15th floor overlooking Broadway. Don't bother to buy beers in the coffee shop as they overcharge the hotel guests. Walk over to 43rd and 8th avenue. The Deli is open 24 hours!! At the hotel if you want your room clean daily talk or leave a message for Abdul who is an all round maintenance or a handyman. At the front desk not much to expect.

UR3174120,2005-9-February,this hotel was in a fantastic location but the hotel was disscusting are bed sheets had holes in the room had never been hovered the staff couldnt speak english we couldnt get into are room as the key would always jam the bath hadnt been cleaned the window wouldnt close and we wernt provided with clean towels or toliet paper.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR4228500,2005-9-December,Well what can I say. We only stayed for 3 nights to attend a wedding in Central Park. We arrived very late on the Thursday night (thank goodness). The smell as you enter the building is something else probably thanks to the adjoining kebab shop but this smell will linger on your clothes throughout your stay. Reception was utter chaos with people shouting for refunds etc along with the NYPD arresting someone! We decided to take a chance and check in. It was the busiest weekend of the year so we didn't have any choice to be honest. The room was an utter disgrace. My suitcase remained closed and locked (more for fear of rats and parasites rather than thieves!!) The room consisted of a king size bed and a tv. You could barely walk around the bed but that just suited me fine as I didn't want to touch the carpet. I made my husband check everything before I entered the room. Underneath the bed were old dirty empty bottles and probably 10 years worth of dust. The wardrobe consisted of a cubby hole and the hanger was an old pipe. The bathroom was just so disgusting it was beyond belief! We were very lucky to have warm water for a shower so we could dress for the wedding but the rest of the time it was freezing cold therefore 1 shower in 3 days! Yuck not pleasant! Once we were over the initial shock we just stayed out of the room as much as we possibly could and just went back to sleep. Do take your own towel if you take a chance with this hotel a pair of flip flops to wear in the shower and something to wear in bed I slept in my clothes and am still itching on my return!! My husband was in the army and is used to seeing some sights but this hotel he said should be condemned!!! We've promised to come back to NY and stay in luxury next time to make up for this year.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3647550,2005-8-July,Unfortunately the person who had booked our trip hadn't read all of the bad reviews before booking our stay at the Carter. As soon as you walk through the front doors of the hotel you are smothered with the scent of chinese food and it sticks with you throughout the whole hotel. The lobby looks like a hangout full of people sticking around to get out of the bad weather. Upon checking in we were told we had 15 minutes to decide whether or not we wanted to stay. Staff didn't seem to think there was anything out of the ordinary on having people wanting to leave upon arrival. When we got to our room it only got worse. The bathrooms had layers and layers of dirt and scum. The only way any normal person could shower in there is if they wanted to leave swim shoes and clothing on. the whole room was pretty much just as scuzzy. Obviously we did not opt to stay the whole time at the Carter. Pretty much the only good thing they had to offer us was the Yellow pages in our room so we could hurry up and book the first room we could find somewhere else.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR4219996,2005-8-December,I cant believe this type of establishment can still be in buisness. We didnt even get as far as the rooms. We were greeted in reception by rude staff and also 4 members of the NYPD as a staff member had pushed a guest! The wait for an hour to get a room was the best experience as every time a guest checked in they went to their room to swiftly return to complain about one of the following: Other people in the room already Room not cleaned in months Dirty underwear in the room Over flowing toilets A mouse etc We then decided to ask to check our room prior to paying (yes upfront) and we were told 'no as it wasnt hotel policy. Pay go check it and then request a refund if you arent happy! If you want somewhere better try next door!' The place is the pits i wouldnt even stay here if they paid me its that bad.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3745425,2005-8-August,Where do i start this place needs to be shut down.The lobby is awful smells likedamp old carpet the staff is so rude.The talk some different launage when you try to check in and the fact they are behind bullet proff glass and the dont have computers they hand write everything now its 2005 they should have computers.Ok first room walked in and it was not cleaned from the last guest went back down to desk the lady said we dont have anymore rooms you can clean it if you like yea right then finally after 15 min she gave me another room key 1432 well this room was a least clean but carpet had stains all over it burn marks and dirt the window was broke and it smelled damp then the bathoom tube was dirty toilet was leaking water on the floor and the ceiling looked lkike it had a water leek there wer big paint bubbles Tv had no remote phone was old and broke furniure was old and nasty. I wouldspent a few more dollers and stay some where else I cant see how they can stay open. Oh and the old lady at the front desk is a real B****.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3345123,2005-8-April,I stayed here for less than usual price i didnt want to stay here after reading the reviews and i knew what i was letting myself in for. Be honest even on the cheap you do want cleanliness this hotel is filthy and the thought of going back after a long day is horrible yes your going to sleep when you get back but what filth are you sleeping in?? The first room we were given wasnt even cleaned from the previous occupants. the second room was made up but still fllthy. They told us that they only clean rooms every other day but this isnt true they will only clean your room if you complain all the time. Avoid it to be honest pay the extra for a clean room as this will ruin your trip staying here.,andycarmichael888
UR4092363,2005-7-November,Just got back from spending four nights at the Carter and have to say believe what you read. We travelled with another couple and both our rooms stanktheres of damp(although improved after 2 days by a new shower curtain so the whole room smelt of plastic) and ours of what can only described of as S#*T. They really did stink. Our carpet was filthy and looked like it could be housing all types of creatures whilst our friends room had a damp patch on the wall about 2 foot long.The handles on the draws in there room was cable flex as was the light pull in our closet/wardrobe which also stunk and was filthy so we lived out of our cases. We had no problems with the staff but had a laugh at the $1 charge for your key and $2 charge to leave your baggage after checking out. On the plus side the location really is first class 300 yards from Times square. Our sheets and towels where clean and had no need to use the ones we took with us after reading other reviews. The air con worked and there were no signs of ratscockroachesdruggiesmurders or prostitutesall of which we expected to see in the lobby after looking at our room for more than 5 minutes. I would certainly never go back but am allready looking back and laughing at the experienceso if you can stand the smell and are prepaired to slum it the location really is fantastic for the price.,4evernorthern
UR3646809,2005-7-July,This was the most disgusting hotel room I have encountered. The front desk staff are very rude. The woman at the counter never said hello... she took one look at us and said "You are not single ... you have your daughter with you... $7.00 more per night!" I had no problem with that even though we were going to share the same double bed. She asked how many room keys and I said "2 please"... she said "That will be $2.00".. After charging my credit card almost $600 she wanted $2 for the room keys. The elevator was filthy and graffiti filled. The hallway to our room was again filthy. The key barely worked in the door. The bed was old and lumpy and again dirty. The desk drawer either had no knobs or were broken. The TV was ancient only received 3 channels and had no remote. The closet reeked of "who knows what!" The bathroom fixtures were so old and there were no towels no soap and the shower curtain was a 99 cent plastic one. I could go on and on... but needless to say... don't waste any time with this hotel... it was the HOTEL HORRIBLE! I ended up staying at a hotel called The Time (6 blocks) away and it was less that $200 per night and super clean with a friendly staff.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3168365,2005-7-February,This is without doubt the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. I can't believe they can get away with this place. I spent 3 months travelling around the US finishing up in NY in December. This hotel was bad beyond all comprehension. The staff were rude the rooms were disgusting. Yes it was central and cheap but not worth it! I still get upset thinking about it!! When I arrived I was given a key to my room on the 10th floor after searching several corridors I entered my room to find dirty towels and sheets on an unmade bed and the bathroom floor covered in used tissues. When I went downstairs to complain they weren't even surprised told me it would be fixed up that afternoon and never once apologised. There was no heating in my room the entire stay. It was colder inside than outside. When I asked about the heating I was told it was automatic but wasn't cold enough for it - December in New York??? I don't think so!!!! The only place there was any heat was the giant lobby area which was always roasting! Other guests I spoke to in the lift were equally unimpressed!! I had to wear several layers of trousers and tops and a hat and gloves to go to bed in the evenings! Also didn't feel too safe when there was someone following me to my room and banging on the door one evening! When the bed was made after I complained (the only time all week) there were still stains all over the sheets. The carpet was damp and covered in rubbish lots of Hotel Carter matches everywhere the tv barely had reception but not a problem as I spent as much time out of the hotel day and night as possible. I would not reccommend this hotel to anyone it makes me angry just thinking about it. I know it seems cheap and you might think it would do as a budget place just to rest your head in but please think again!!!,jamesandjane
UR3341407,2005-7-April,Trust me. Just don't go. However cheap this place is looking however close to Times Square (and wow - it is close) this place will ruin your city break. Filthy room. Carpet on the walls. Graffitti in the lift. Disgusting smell in the lobby. Bats / rats in the rooms. No hot water at peak times (not that you want to shower in the filthy ancient bathrooms) Want to shave? Sorry - no plugs. Broken phone / television. We had ripped dirty sheets and a pillow stolen from the Mt Sinai Hospital for crying out loud... My vacation was fantastic but for the hotel... The one regret was that we'd not invested that little bit more in somewhere at least habitable to stay. If we'd found the prostitutes in the lobby it would have been a highlight. Trust me people - DON'T COME HERE.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3846565,2005-6-September,You must avoid this hotel at all costs !! Please trust me : spend more but do not go to this place. When we got there a couple of prostitutes where hanging out in the lobby. One of them was screaming out profanities to the manager and asking for her money back. When it was our turn to check in the service was so awful that I started feeling bad for the prostitute ! - Our reservations weren't there but we had already been billed on our credit card. -The staff was rude. -The rooms were filty. -We found maggets on our beds. -Theres were holes and red stains in our so called towels. -There were no lights in the bathrooms. -There were moles everywhere in the bathtub. -The TV was not working. -There was unidentified hair on our sheets and pillows. We paid for 3 nights but only stayed for a couple of hours because it was so disgusting. Don't think that I'm a picky person. After all I'm from Hati so I've seen pauvrety and some pretty wild stuff but I would still prefer a spot under a tree then a room at that hotel. When we decided to leave at the lobby were at least 12 other angry and screaming tourists from France Brazil Spain that were all complaining to the management team who didn't seem to care. Book elswere or don't go to New York !,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3445427,2005-6-May,The managing is a problem but the rooms will be cleaned up if you asked them a couple of times. You could stay there for a week. Just a week!,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2984923,2005-6-January,This place was the worst place. It was the King of all Roach motels. The pictures are ridiculous and does not even come close to the atrocities that you will encounter once you get there. First off the staff was extremely rude. When we got our room key we opened the door and walked in on another couple! When we finally got a different room it was so filthy that when we turned on the water from the spout rust shot out! I squatted over their toilet the whole time and I also threw all their towels on theground and walked on those. The next night I ended up almost getting into a fight with the front desk clerk because she was rude as hell! I thought this room was okay since I was there for NYE and it boasts being on Times Square. This place should just be condemned because it would save a lot of people from ruiining their trips. Oh! Not to mention I had to call security THREE times because their were couples getting into fistfights in the hallway!,A TripAdvisor Member
UR4164725,2005-6-December,I went to New York this Nov as a birthday preasent with my mum. We arrived at the Hotel and the decor in the lobby area was not to my taste but I would let that slid. After waiting 40mins for my key to the room we was rudley asked for '1 Dolla' for the key from the dragon like women in reception. We went up to our room on the 6th floor. When we got there we were confronted by a smell that i could not even began to explain. We went to the end of the hallway and found our room. The only was to describe it was a scene from Scarface. It was the most run down room I had ever seen in my life. I mean I know it was a cheap hotel but I was horrified by the state of it. There was 2 double beds a broken tv and a bathroom and toilet area i would not even let my dog in. The room was filthy and there was hair around the skirting and head borad. When we went to unpack our stuff (that was after firmly locked and left in the suitcase) we found several empty 'Trojan' packs under the bed and prostitues advertising there services inside the wardrobes! Absoloutley NASTY. The staff were rude and unhelpful. On our last day there (thank god we were only there for the weekend) we were to be out of the rooms by 1pm. We went for lunch and then returned at 12.30pm. We had been locked out of our rooms. When we went to the reception to ask why we had been locked out of the room. The lovely receptionist told us 'you are ment to be out'!!! And the cleaners (that I saw onece) looked around the age of 11. DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL!!!!,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2977549,2005-5-January,Recently returned from a Christmas trip to New York and had to let fellow travellers know how bad the Carter Hotel is. I know you get what you pay for and in a big city but this hotel really was dire!!!! Having read reviews before I left I wasn't expecting the world but this was worse than expected. They really don't know the meaning of a vaccuum cleaner seriously don't look under the beds. What makes it worse is the staff don't actually see what's wrong with the place. Rooms are very basic some you really can't swing a cat in just about enough room for a bed. If you're thinking of a trip to New York on the cheap go for it but steer well clear of this one!!!!,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3992490,2005-4-October,Oh my God !!! we have never stayed in such a disgusting filthy smelly tatty scary place in our lives. The bedroom was just awful.........it was filthy and hadn't been cleaned in years the sheets were full of holes and tears. As for the bathroom well never seen anything like it!!! The moment we walked through the door we knew we had made a huge mistake booking this hotel. We put our luggage in the room and immediately went out to find alternative accomodation. Unfortunately due to being near to Christmas every hotel nearby was fully booked so we had to stay the night. We did not sleep a wink and tried not to touch the sheets with our bare skin - we slept in our coats to keep warm. The people working at the hotel were extremely unhelpful and very rude! As soon a the sun came up off we went in search of another hotel. We checked out and didn't look back. This hotel should be closed down and burnt to the ground How on earth it is allowed to stay open we really cannot understand. London England.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3251129,2005-4-March,This hotel is totally unsuitable for any school trips. Please be warned group leaders not to use this hotel as the staff are rude you will never get any sense of them and they are positively and deliberately unhelpful pretending (or otherwise) not to speak English and creating a very stressful stay. The Hotel is used by prostitutes and the rooms were absolutely filthy. It was safer on the streets of New York than in the hotel. Although we had booked single beds for every student the hotel put as many as three to a bed. The bedrooms are really dirty with some beds not made up and wet. The top floor of this hotel is extremely unpleasant and dangerous. The hotel put students all over the hotel and away from staff. If you are offered this hotel avoid at all costs.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3634575,2005-4-July,I have been staying at the Hotel Carter (formally Hotel Dixie Pre 1950) for the past 10 years. I stay as a last desperate attempt when no rooms are available in Midtown or when the prices are so high its not worth the money. If you spend anytime in your hotel room besides sleeping or showering this is not your place. There is no maid service to speak of (so save your towels) no cable TV no desk net access and you will be lucky to get a window A/C unit that works. If you stay on a lower floor the water pressure is so incredible. There are no watersavers here just a huge Flow of high pressure water that can stip your skin off if your not carefule. The beds are old used hospital beds and well broken in. The sheets are clean once you arrive (I would not trust the comforter) but are not changed during your stay. I would advise against unpacking your suitcases and putting anything in the closets or dressers. The rooms claim to be renovated but I don't think nailing old carpet to the wall in back of the beds would be considered a full renovation. I did not see any bugs (I think they know better) and the rates are cheap $89 so you can't complain on that front. I have stayed at worse places. If this is your first trip to NYC please don't stay here as this does not represent the USA very well. The hotel is for very cheap frugal travelers (like me) who don't need frills and spend very time in the room. If you get a high up room the view can be excellent.,rodco
UR3723909,2005-30-July,You know it's gonna be a bad start when the entrace to the hotel has a display of nutcrackers in the window. I wasn't even sure if that was the entrance as I had to lug my suitcase as well as my fiancee's suitcase up a flight of stairs. From there it got even better. We stood in line to what we believed was the check-in counter. Looked more like a counter to a pawn shop where two rude employees sat behind a plexi-glass covered counter. We had reservations but they said they didn't see it in their system. While my fiancee was on her cell phone trying to clear up this confusion with AMEX it gave me and my niece time to take in the ambiance of the lobby. I loved the patchwork of rugs which made up the carpet and the neon lights which made it look like those cheap motels in movies where hookers go to. It really bothered me. I kept looking around the lobby thinking was this the same place I saw online. I later looked online to find out the pictures were much different. Could I file a fraud lawsuit or something? I must say the room pictures looked the same but for some reason it looks way better online than in person. Plus the fact they probably used the best room in the hotel to take a picture as our room's furniture was broken down. Missing drawers and broken doors. I was too scared to open the drawers. If you love NBC then you're in luck if you had our room. That was the only channel that really worked. All the other channels came in fuzzy. You had to play with the cable connection to the tv to get a somewhat clear picture. The bathrrom was great if you love sitting on the toilet with your right leg and right should virtually pressed to the front door and wall. The door wouldn't shut properly. Maybe they planned it that way. Good thinking. We were lucky as it looked like the just put in new tile but the showers weren't that great and all the faucets kept dripping. I guess they don't care about their water bill. I kept thinking that Ashton Kutcher was gonna jump out of the closet but I don't thing even he would be that brave. That closet was something else. Had a musty smell. If I was there by myself I would think it was one of the places that Scooby-Doo stayed and there would be a gremlin waiting for me in the hallways. If it wasn't for those darned kids!!,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3435845,2005-3-May,I stayed from April 29th-May 2nd. The place looks like a hostel where prostitutes would stay in some bad movie. There was this smell of urine and dampness in the hotel and the lobby looked like something out of a bad movie in Bangkok. You are not allowed visitors unless they leave an ID at the front desk. My friend that has traveled around the world and in 3rd world countries said he has seen better. Several people complained about not having heat. My first room did not. The second room they gave me was the "best in house" it was just as bad as the first minus the blood stained sheet and the hair and weird color in the toilet. My second room had trash bags covering the windows with duct tape there was a phone number above my headboard and graffitti as well. Room 1834-was supposed to be the prime room however the bathroom shower filled the tub in 5 minutes I asked for towels and received hand towels by a very rude old woman that yelled at the guests about complaining. No toiletries and a leaking toilet that I could see my own urine running out on to the towel that was wrapped around the pipes. This old woman told people daily how "lucky they were to stay in a cheap place". Mind you my travel agent placed me there and I will never trust a hotel that doesn't have a brand name. The conversations in the elevator with other guests were the same we were all disgusted by the condition and the fact that the health department was not there to investigate. Do not stay here. Pics will be posted on website of what it looks like so stay tuned. Their pics are false!,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3243367,2005-3-March,I stayed in The Carter in Feb 05 for 4 nights; I should have read the reviews on this site. It is a one star budget hotel in desperate need of renovation. Services and facilities are non-existent. Despite repeated requests our room was not cleaned during our stay. The hotel is however ideally situated just off Times Square. Theatres and shopping centres are in easy walking distance. I could not recommend this hotel it really is grim!!! But if you are a backpacker looking for affordable accommodation in order to explore Manhattan the Carter may be for you. If your expectations are any more than a basic bed in a rundown hotel then dont even consider it.,Ken131
UR2971839,2005-3-January,I read all the reviews on here and still decided to book a stay at the Hotel Carter. I wanted to go to Times Square for New Years Eve. Other hotels were about $800-$1200 for 2 nights but the Hotel Carter was $250 ($89 the first and $129 New Years Eve + tax). Let's be honest - it's not the Hilton. We checked in on December 30 2004. I checked for any reservations before we left and it was totally booked. I had two copies of my reservation (in case they kept one) and presented one at the desk for check in. Since this had the price on it I didn't have any problems. The receipt and room information was already printed so I just had to check and sign the credit card receipt. Everybody was ID'd and it was printed on their receipt. One of the booking problems is that it seemed like all the reservations were done on paper. The lady at the desk had a huge stack to go though but found ours. After collecting $1 for our room key and signing all the receipts we were off to our room. I first walked in the room was larger than one that I had stayed at in the Paramount Hotel. The floor had been vacumned and the bed was made. The biggest problem with the hotel is it's age. The carpet is old and worn and the bathroom has seen better days. The reviews about the TV are correct you only get about 4 channels. The shower was tiled and was old. Because of it's age it looked dirty but really wasn't. Because the hotel was filled the elevators were a bit slow. However at busy times the hotel staff escorted guests by using the freight elevator in the back. I would say the average wait time was 5-7 minutes. My room was on the south side of the building on the 21st floor. I was able to get a wireless signal on my laptop from the Hilton Hotel. The biggest problem I noticed was with the shower. If you take your shower at peak times when the hotel has a lot of guests it tends to "pulsate" hot and cold. At one point it would get really hot then really cold. This would be a problem if you have children (there is only a standup shower). However my girlfriend took her shower at 'off-peak' times and didn't have much of a problem. Best advice - bring shower shoes it will make you feel better. There is a small store (which has beer) in the lobby area. It's open 24 hours but it's kind of pricy. I bought 2 candybars for $3 & 8 wine coolers for $30. It also has sandwiches and cooked food which looked pretty good. There is a drug store and other stores less than a block away. There is also an ice cream place about a 1/2 block away and a Starbucks also. The hotel lobby has several vending machines with soda water and other drinks for only $1 which was a good deal. There is a smoke detector system in the hallways but not in the rooms. There are battery powered smoke detectors in the room however mine was taken down and put in a drawer. I don't believe that there is a sprinkler system in the building. The room doors had a latch system deadbolt and a chain. The heating system was a steam radiator. I couldn't get the lever to work to control it (which was on) so I regulated the heat by opening the window. The windows are newer thermal pane with one half being an air conditioner. The air conditioner was manufactured in 2002. If you have anything that has a three-prong plug ( like a laptop power supply) there is only one outlet with the ground. The others are the "two" type version. You would have to bring an adapter or unplug the air conditioner. There were two parking garages - one next to the hotel and one directly across the street. I didn't park there but they looked okay. The hotel is only one block away from Times Square. If you are a neat freak offended by old yellowed fixtures or plan on spending your whole vacation in your room this isn't the place for you. If you are like me and wanted somewhere to shower and sleep so you could explore the city it's just fine. I'm not cheap but it sure saved me a bundle. With everything there is to do in New York why be in a room?,Crimeguy
UR3975553,2005-29-September,This place was absolutely disgusting. The only thing good about it was that it was right near Times Square. When we called to ask if there was a parking lot to park our car the woman said that there was and that we'd be able to take it in and out of the lot w/o paying extra. When we got there the parking attentant told us that we could not. We went inside and asked the woman behind the desk and told her that whoever answered the phone when we made the reservation told us we could take the car in/out of the lot w/o paying extra. The lady stated that it depended on who was working the garage. That first of all gave me a bad impression of them the fact that they're not all on the same page. Then we were on our way up to the room. The elevator was old slow and seemed kind of musty. When we got off the elevator on our floor the hallway was long dark and plain like something out of a horror movie. We got to our room and the door barely opened we had to kick it open and slam it shut. The room was tiny dark and small. The head of the bed was against the wall and the foot of the bed was practically against the wall on the other side of the room that's how small the room was. The view we had was of a dumpster and we could barely walk near the window b/c the foot of the bed was so close to the wall and there was a tv at the corner. The tv had only 2 working channels and the walls were covered w/ writing that guests carved into it. Now onto the bathroom. This bathroom light was the brightest light in the room. We had to put down the toilet lid to flush the toilet and had to use all our strength to flush. The sink dripped water nonstop and the shower was a hole in the wall w/ a shower curtain covering it. It was worse than those public baths at the beach. The dirty room we could stand but the dirty shower was definitely unbearable. We tried to call down to the front desk 3 times to let them know we wanted a refund and there was no response. We figured the quickest we get out of there it'll be more likely that we could get a refund they absolutely refused to give any types of refunds. We were actually willing to take a loss so that we wouldn't have to stay there but turns out all the other hotels were booked or the prices were outrageous due to it being the September 11th weekend. We ended up not taking the car out of the garage b/c everything was close so we could either walk or cab it. We took a shower w/ our slippers on and we had to leave the door half opened b/c the bathroom door was just like the door to the room it wouldn't open or close w/o some strength. I'm warning everybody to NOT pay a visit to this hotel! It reminded us of a cheap hooker motel.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR4153274,2005-29-November,If only I had read these comments before we booked. In the two hours we spent there we saw three different rooms. On approaching the first we noted a strong smell of gas which soon became sewerage eventually the source of the odour turned out to be our room! When we informed reception the our room stank they asked in what way exactly 'like something died in it'. Rooms 2 and 3 were simply filthy mouldy and containing 2 double beds clearly previous residence of an extended family of refugees. Interestingly the French residents didn't seem to mind.... We told the dragon lady that we could not stay in such a place and would be checking out immediately refund would have to be arranged through our travel agent - still waiting on that one! Went to the Eddison instead location as good only a little more expensive and a thousand times better. Our Porter commented that the Carter should be shut down as it was notorious crack den and mostly used by hookers and drug addicts.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3618767,2005-29-June,BAD...BAD...BAD...BEWARE...AWFUL...TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE I wish I had read about this hotel on this website before I booked my reservation. I booked my reservation through a well known and reputable Internet Travel reservation website. The Hotel Carter desk personnel were rude and they would not accept that I had already paid for my room through the Travel website even though I handed them a printout of my complete intinerary with confirmation numbers. I contacted the Internet Travel website and they tried several times to call the Hotel Carter but they would not even answer their main number. I spent 2 miserable hours in that awful lobby trying to check in. I finally insisted the Internet travel service to move me to a different hotel. They could not find me another hotel in Manhattan so I spent my first 2 nights out on Long Island in a much better hotel. While I was in the miserable lobby a Hotel Carter guest asked to have maintenance come to her room because she had no air conditioning. New York in Summer with no air conditioning cannot be a good thing. Another guest was greatly relieved to be getting their suitcase back apparently it had been missing. The hotel appeared to have nothing computerized. As rooms were being assigned they were being marked out on a yellow legal pad. It was mass confusion behind the desk and I had to wait in line at least 30 minutes to try to check in. After looking at these pictures of the rooms on this website I am so glad I did not get in a room so that they could charge me. The pictures of the lobby are totally accurate. Nothing has been changed although I am sure it is dirtier. Stay away for your own good.,ctex99
UR4068233,2005-28-October,I would not recommend this place but it's not as bad as most of the other reviews say. I am currently half-way through a two night stay and have decided to check move to another hotel tomorrow. The main reasons are the room is too hot (there is a manually-operated air conditioner but it seems to be either on or off and if it's on the fan it pretty loud) and there is no hanging space for clothes in the room. On the plus side the bed is huge and the location is excellent. There was actually a small fire last night and the hotel was evacuated at 4.30 in the morning. Potentially this place could be great. It's still good value particularly if you're sharing a room and don't mind going without hanging space in the room (I'm assuming they don't have hanging space in the other rooms).,fluiman
UR3418587,2005-27-April,Well my girlfriend booked for 3 nights. It was the nasty most unsanitary 3 nights I ever had. When we arrived we couldnt imagine how anyone could charge money to stay in a dump like this. Sleeping on the street homeless would be a more sanitary affair. The bathroom was disgusting; there was grim dirt and hair in the shower with a plastic bag holding the shower head. The bed was the NASTIEST thing I have ever seen. It was falling apart and had stains and all sorts of nasty looking things on it under the sheets. Towels and sheets where never changed in all 3 days as they said "we ran out" Which is total BS because I had to steal some new towels form the maid that was cleaning one of the rooms that someone had left. TV didn't really work (but I didn't care) I spent as little time as possible. Honestly this place is a absolute dump. Do your self a favor spend the extra bit of money to stay in a Days in or comfort in at least you know you'll be in a clean place.,Zazzn
UR3939381,2005-26-September,When we go to New York It was great! The BIG apple. It had such a great buzz until we got to our hotel. When we managed to get our bags up the stairs to the jazzy looking reception area I thought we had just walked in a bank the receptionist were behind bullet glass! (well thats what it looked like) and when we went to check in the woman behind the bullet glass could not speak clear English as receptionist should be capable of even if it was the basics..... and she had no manners! It was like talking to brick wall. When we go to our room we just dumped our bags and wanted a quick bath before we went out to get some dinner and take in the New York sights. There was no plug in the bathroom so I went down to the reception and said we had no plug for the bath. 2 hours later we got a plug I was so stressed all i wanted to do is get that bloody plug and whip her with it!!! Please dont go there if you are looking for a nice place to sleep cause it aint!!!,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3936773,2005-25-September,Upon arrival I discovered my room had not been cleaned and a small chinese man helped to supposedly sanitize my sink with his filthy hands and some water. Upon trying to lay in bed for the night I found the sheets were covered in some sort of biological mess. I used lysol wipes and a pillow case as a pillow cover and found they could not cover the smell of the rat feces. When I used the bathroom I found myself locked in because the lock was conveniently jammed I and had to have assistance to get out. Upon my return to bed found a rotent running across the window sill with request from the small chinese man received nothing but hard heart ache and pian from the fact that his hotel had nothing to offer except but rudeness smell and disease.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3936859,2005-24-September,Im writing to warn everyone who is considering stay in this hotel. I wanted people to know what happened to me and hopefully you will understand it's not worth to take the risks. This hotel totally ruined my vacation and I will always remember this horrible experience. Safety is the most important thing while traveling in NYC and this place is DANGEROUS. Crime happens in this hotel everyday! I seriously think the hotel should be closed down by the government and I truly don't know why they are still in business. My husband my sister and I arrived at Hotel Carter on 09/15/05. It took us 2.5 hours to check-in. (They dont have a computer. Every thing is memorized in hotel stuffs head or written by hand. Unfortunately the hotel stuffs are not very organized they messed up peoples reservation and they dont seem care or feel sorry.) While we were waiting we saw so many unbeliveable things happened... 2 girls who had left their luggages in the hotel's storage room but the bags are gone when they came back. (Note: The hotel charge $2-3 per bag but they are taking responsibilities for your stuff.) Two polices came and found out a guy who works in the hotel stole the bags and dump the empty bags in a big trash car. The hotel manager seems known that but he protent he didn't know. At the same time there were 15-20 people complaining to the hotels manager about no water in their room and some said their TV/air condition are not working (PS. it was 90 degree and humid in NYC.) Hotel manager told everyone they are aware of the problem and are fixing it. By the afternoon water will be available at every room. Even people are not happy but they accept the fact that they are not getting water any sooner. Finally we got our key to the room and we were told that our room is ready. I opened the door there are still 2 people in the room and... well un-dressed. I apologized to them and back to front desk and asked for a new room. We waited for another half hour. (While we are standing there the stuff blame each other for the mistake they made.) They gave us another room and we found there is no water in our room. So we back to the lobby again and the manager promised that when we come back in the evening water will be available. So we went out and started our first day in NYC. After walking on the Time Square whole afternoon we returned to hotel around 7:00PM- exhausted and smelled and of course we all wanted to take a shower. As soon as we get into the lobby there are so many people argued with the hotel stuffs and things start to hit up- we Shockley found out the hotel had no water for TWO DAYS!!!! Many of the people didnt shower for two days! Of course they are angry and frustrated. Unbelievable! My husband questioned the manager and asked him to tell us the truth- either the water will come or not. The manager said with really cold voice: No body knows I dont know either I hope the water will come tonight but I dont know I cannot guarantee! My husband tried to understand why they didnt tell us they have this major problem when we check-in in the morning. And he wanted to know if they really have people fixing the water system or not- we didnt see any plumbers or workers. The manager just totally ignored his questions and walked away. I also heard one of the hotel stuff shout to another man and a couple: Dont ask me I dont know I dont know (repeatedly) go away OK? Stop asking me! If you dont like you can go! Go! As you can imagine people started to shout back to the stuff. There were also about 20-25 people waiting for the check in- some of them stop the check-in process and tried to get their money. Some of them just standing there hopelessly and dont know what to do. My husband started to raise his temple as well. Allow me to point this out clearly he is a very gentle and lovely person. I have known him for 12 years and I have never seen him like that. Like other people he asked for the money back the Asia lady told him you can go if you wanted to go! But she has no intention to return our money. We started to argue with her and she said: Get out get out! You get out of my hotel I dont want you THESE KIND OF PEOPLE here dont even thinking to stay here again! Excuse me who wants to stay there ever again? I never ever again step in here even you give me money to stay here! I found myself shouting back to her. After talked to my husband we decided to leave. I cannot let my sister (who flied 18 hours to New York to join us) staying there. She was absolutely exhausted. We stormed back to our room and get our stuff down to the lobby and prepared to leave. There were even more people. We also saw two poor girls who lost their baggage and the guy who is in-charged for the storage room seems not care. He in his poor English telling the girls: I dont know what happen to your stuff they are gone. I have no idea who took them. People started to lose control and one of the guy tired to bit up the hotel manager and the guy. The Asia lady is still shutting to people- by the by she was standing behind bullet proofs glass the whole time. She keeps asking people to come up-front if they wanted to check-in!! No water in the building and they still want people to check-in? It just doesnt make any sense to me. My party and I were kicked out from the hotel at 9:30 PM at night in NYC. At that time 99.9% of the hotels in the city are booked. We spent an hour to call all the hotels on the yellow page. Finally we found a four stars hotel for $410 a night. Needless to say we have no choices- we ended up stay there. Over all its such scary experience. And also this is why I detailed what happen that night in order to show you how bad the hotel is. I seriously think the hotel should be closed down.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR4141283,2005-24-November,Arrived at hotel having booked online. Noticed state of entrance which should have been a clue to what turned out to be a tired hotel in need of urgent updating. Keeping what they have clean would have been a start! Staff were apathetic to say the least. I was given my room key and found the room had not been made up or cleaned. I was given an alternative room which was made up but felt so depressed I immediately checked out and went to the BW President on W 48th Street (Where I normally stay) it was a little more expensive but twice the hotel than the Carter. Moral of this story: Stick to what you know and don't try save a couple of extra bucks!! Avoid the Carter Hotel like the plague!!!!!!!!!!!!!,A TripAdvisor Member
UR4299014,2005-24-December,wow!! I think we must have stayed in the Hotel Carter Penthouse!! It is a very basic hotel. The Spanish guy who worked on the desk at the night was nice enough as was the young Asian girl. There is internet access in the lobby which is quite cool. Its great if you don't mind the 60+ year old black guy who comes up to you while you're typing telling you how he doesn't hate anybody and gibbers to himself!! He was sat next to me just talking fast to himself before talking to me. Oh silly me i forgot to tell you that he is the night watchman/ security person. He was a nice guy and always said hello even though i wasn't sure about the guy. The New York cops were in the lobby twice while we stayed including an undercover cop escorting somebody out in the elevator! Anyway here starts my honest account in chronological order. We got a little lost around Times Square so asked a cop where it was. He chuckled a little when we said the Carter but he said its ok they've done it out a lot just keep your things locked up! By this point we're tired from carrying our stuff we just wanna get there. And we did 2 minutes later- absolutely fantastic location. went into the las vegas style lobby and checked in with the young asian girl. we stayed in room 1502. The lobby wasn't too bad in all fairness. A few times we heard people discussing whether they should check out or not. In the lift we go a bit of a funny old polish smell and needed a vacuum but its a lift but it really doesn't matter. And through the hallways. Pretty ok nothing too drastic. Now into the room. Looking at the other photos on this site I seems like we had the Penthouse suite!! Floor: Needed a good vacuum- under the bed was very dusty and i found a fortune cookie shaped bag. It didn't look like a pyramidal tetleys tea bag so i investigated. CAUTION DO NOT HANDLE RAT POISON. Oh cool. so back under the bed it went. I must stress though as bad as that sounds i found no evidence of Rat or mouse activities. Some of the carpet was not fastened in the corners but if you had the guts to look under you are better than us!! Bedding: Very clean superb couldnt ask for more. Very comfortable nights sleep except for the odd door slamming but the walls where thick and we didnt hear anyone in the adjacent rooms being rowdy. The headboard was indeed the innovative technique of nail the scrap of carpet to the wall but again was clean and no complaints. Pillows were clean as well. No stains. Electronics: Panel hanging off in the corner with 3 or 4 wires showing! One of the socket outlets was hanging off but we had one that was good to use. Our telly worked in it as well. But we just ignored them and got on. The plug in the bathroom looked well dodgy looked burnt in a sense so we didnt use it. Disposable shavers are the best trust me!! All lights worked and the switch was safe. The room had been repainted. It wasnt a bad job but there was the occassional lump of paint around from not being applied properly. Lots of the paint was put on thickly looked out of date paint you know the type that dries out and streaks thickly?? The bathroom: No major complaints. Taps leaked when putting them on but hot water came through was generally clean tiles a little grimey maybe. Shower curtain was clean. I had great showers water came hot very quickly. The basin had no plug but we managed to use it. I wouldn't recommend asking for improvements to our room but we knew what to expect so were quite satisfied. Besides if we did ask the old asian lady seemed a bit mean and rude. If you expect crap especially by going on some of these reviews then you may be pleasantly suprised- we certainly where however some of these reviews are so recent that i honestly think we had the penthouse suite!! If you expect something moderate then you may be ok with it you may not be. Overall i give it a 2/3 out of 5 but thats because we had the heads up on what it was like. Would i stay again? I would stay in room 1502 again but judging by some of these rooms on the reviews i certainly would'nt. Oh don't use the deli/snack place next door- its a rip off. you can go to other places such as k-mart on 34th street and load up on snack treats and drinks. If i have missed anything please don't hesitate to email me to ask any questions about the place. Kreese,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3401037,2005-24-April,I have just returned from New York and our one night stay in the Carter Hotel (if it can be called a hotel) was the worst I have ever experienced. In fact it was so bad that we checked out after the first night and found another hotel for the remaining four nights of our stay. It started when we checked in at 7pm and were told that our room wasn't clean. In fact when we went and had a look it was worse than unclean; the sheets actually had blood all over them! We were told 45 mins to clean the room but when we came back from dinner the room hadn't been touched. Eventually we were moved to another room which while it was cleaner the bathroom window didn't close let alone lock - not great in the middle of a large city. To be honest the staff couldn't care less. When I was talking to the 'manager' he actually walked off and I had to call him back and when we checked out early the staff were actually surprised!!! I have stayed in some pretty rough places but never have i stayed somewhere that was unclean and felt unsafe. If I had been on my own I would not have stayed there for one night for the fear of something happening. D o n o t s t a y h e r e!!!! I only wish I'd read the reviews before I made the booking. You are not getting a bargin you are booking a nightmare.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR4045906,2005-23-October,me and my friend stayed at this hotel october 2005.To be honest i expected the worstbut to my surprise it was'nt that bad!as we entered the hoteli did get a musty smellbut i kept goin anywayafter all it was in Times Square where all the action happens!i found the staff friendly enough. We got our key and went to our roomthe part i dreaded the most! we stayed on the 20th floor.i have to sayit does have some serious decorative issues.The wall paper is very oldthe curtains and carpets the same.But to my amazementthe beds were very comfy!our bed linen was very clean and the bathroom was up to standardthe water in the shower does blow a bit hot and cold thoughbut the pressure is good.The cleaners came to clean our room twice in the one week we stayed there and change the bed clothes!i was surprised.The air conditioning worked fine toowhich was good cause i found the room quite warm at times.Overalli didnt have any complaintsthe location could'nt be betteri will stay there again the next time i go backfor $300 a week it did just fine.They also have internet access in the lobbywhich i found quite handy!another thingfor all the bad reviews i readi was shocked to see the amount of people coming thru the doors of this hotel!so you might not think its that bad at all!,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3495629,2005-23-May,I was really worried about this hotel after reading some of the reviews but we didn't find that it was so bad. They didn't clean the room every day and we had to go down to the desk for towels but they were very helpful and polite and while the room wasn't newly renovated or anything it really wasn't so bad. The room had two king sized beds and was quite comfortable. The bathroom had lots of hot water we had as many towels as we wanted and it wasn't dirty. It wasn't new but it wasn't dirty either. There was a broken window at the end of the hall but our door and windows locked and we felt quite secure. Best of all it was $149 a night for 4 people right in the center of the city - exactly where you'd want to be in NYC !!!,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3606449,2005-23-June,The hotel is gross. The staff is rude. I've been in bad hotels before but this is problably the worst in my life. I've never seen so much crap and stains around me. At 10 pm I was still waiting for a clean room (the one that they gave me at the begining was not clean from the previous customers) I was going to spend 2 nights and I couldn't stand it more than 1. Please!!!! Don't go to this hotel. It totally -----,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3692813,2005-22-July,my friend and i stayed at the hotel carter last june. we knew that we didn't have a lot of money to spend on a nice hotel so we went with the carter. it was my first time in NYC so i didn't really care how the hotel was which is a good thing. the lobby was like walking into a chinese buffet and the extent of wall decor was carpet nailed above the beds as a head board. the tv got only 4 channels only one of which came in clear. i wasn't expecting the ritz so i wasn't that dissapointed. it was definately a fun adventure and if you can handle a little yuck at times then you'll be fine.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3928110,2005-21-September,i wouldnt advise any one in their right mind to go to this hotel it was worse than terrible very bad manners at the reception when booking in the lobby was discustingly dirty full of unsatisfied customers. the stench of the place was unbearable the rooms were filty carpets on the walls!! carpets on the floor were not fitted properlyanddirty. curtains about fifty years old afraid to touch them incase might catch something!! bathroom tiny could bearly move around! seems good value for money but a total rip off!!!!!!,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3490838,2005-21-May,So we wanted to stay in NYC for the weekend since hotels in NY are so expensive we booked a room were we could afford it ($120.00 a nite-not exactly cheap but compared to $400 we took it) We didn't make it to far My husband went to check in he said there was a fist fight in the lobby A couple who had changed there room 3 times because of noise And were told by staff there was a group of boys staying at the hotel- And they can do as the want. The staff wanted to see the ID's of our children and became very rude when my husband said they don't have ID's He called me ( I was parked out front) I told him forget itlet's just drive home- Outside of the hotel where I was parked there were people throwing things out of the windows at passers by hitting them with whatever objects they had in their room At one point a guy walks out of the hotel totally in a bloody pulp! I can't review the rooms since I didn't stay there but I'll tell ya we have stayed in some crappy hotels but this one takes the cake!,jerseysourpuss
UR3290813,2005-21-March,like most other people who have written reviews i agree without a doubt the worst hotel i have ever stayed in. the place is filthynot a maid to be seen  would not like to guess the last time the carpets were vacumed.our room was boiling the window wouldnt stay open so had it propped with the yellow pages.the walls were covered in graffiti rather frightening was the one that said evil lurks within this room look under the bedfortunatley didnt see this one until we were leaving!place stank of chinese food and damp.really there is nothing good to say except it is a fab location.i thank god that i didnt have children with me because there is no way i would have stayed there because as well as being unsanitary it was dangerous(electrical wiring and towels which were basically rags next to naked light bulbs)i have stayed in some dumps in my life and wasnt expecting much from a one star hotel but this should not have a star and how it manages to stay open and pass saftey inspections is beyond me..if there was a fire here which is not an impossibility i fear the consequences would be tragic.soi would say go to a hostel go anywhere but stay here.as i am an artist it was an interesting experience but hardly pleasant!!,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3022270,2005-21-January,This so called hotel is simply hell!!! Its disgusting filthy dirty has a major insect and smell problem and the bath/shower were best avoided. It is also clear the bed linen was not changed between guests and the "owners/managemtent" just don't feel any of the above requires any attention. For the love of god please pay a few dollars more and do not subject yourself to the hell hole!!!,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3926443,2005-20-September,during the 20 minute wait in the disgusting lobby to check in there were two separate fistfights and a steady stream of guests coming down the elevators to complain that there was no running water. the extremely rude lady at the desk charged $1 for a room key. the hallways smelled like urine and the door to my room had a big hole in it. i left immediately. i would never stay here.,MCO407
UR3583403,2005-20-June,We were there for 3 nights because it was a busy weekend and every other hotel in Manhatan was full and I must tell you this place should be closed by the Department of Health. The bathroom had mildew and it smelled the water faucets were broken and the sink was clogged leaking all over the bathroom floor. You get 1 towel per person. The TV didn't work the linen and pillows were filthy. Our room was never cleaned. The AC in the lobby is kept off and it gets like 150 degrees in there. We tried complaining to the front desk staff and they were so rude they hung up the phone. This place was NASTY!,A TripAdvisor Member
UR4252841,2005-20-December,This hotel is rubbish. it is dirty with some very disturbing smells eminating from the bathroom. and the corridors. and the lobby. under our bed was roughly ten years of filth and debauchery. i had to drink just to be able to sleep there - it is that bad. the 'wildlife' was more friendly than the staff but i'm undecided as to whether this was a good thing or not. please please avoid this --- at all costs unless you like infections.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3240122,2005-2-March,We stayed 5 nights in this hell hole. The rude women behind the bullet proof glass at the reception were a great welcome to our 5 nights in New York. One star is too much for this so called hotel. No cleaners or maids at all. This place is an absolute joke. Such a great location is ruined by disgraceful service and some of the worst facilities ever. If you are planning on staying here bring your sleeping bag and ask if you can sleep on the pavement out the front it will be safer and healthier. A Joke.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3522148,2005-2-June,I took my family to new your for 3 night I had made reservations at the Carter Hotel for all three nights. I started reading all the reviews and was changing my mind about staying there. We took the chance and kept our reservation. We arrived at about 11am and there was a line. When the lady at the counter helped us she said that the room we had reserved was not available and that they had a smaller room but it would be at the same price. Then she tells me that if we wanted we could wait for the room we reserved but it would not be ready for a few hours since it was being cleaned. We waited and it wasn't ready till about 5pm. The room was average it didn't seem too clean. The room looked very out dated and like it needed a good vacuming. The shower looked old but functional. The rooms are not made up everyday during your stay and you have to get your towels at the front desk everyday. While we were waiting in the lobby for our room to be ready we withnessed several arguments between the customers and the staff. The staff were on the rude side and they didn't care. Overal the hotel is old and you get the basics. Customer service is not a top priority or goal. Again you get what you pay for.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2971363,2005-2-January,I have never been so grossed out by the conditions of a hotel in my life!!!! this place was aweful. It smelled really really bad they don't clean your room there are no towels the bathtub has not been washed in 20 years and to top it all off the tub doesn't even drain. We were there for new years and hated every minute not to mention the fact that we were stuck in the elevator for 45 minutes...yes I said stuck in the elevator for 45 minutes.....Oh the carpet.....your headboard is oriental rugs hung on the wall. The lobby is a sight to see...... oh yeah you have to ask for toilet paper they don't have maid service... One last warning the key DEPOSIT is not a DEPOSIT at all they wont give it back to you even if you have a recipt...,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3113086,2005-2-February,If you want to enjoy you New York vacation please do NOT stay in this hotel. It is a dump the whole place was a disaster zone. It was filthy with unchanged sheets and faecal matter around the toilet not to mention broken windows and locks the place needs knocking down. I couldn't belive it was classed as a two star hotel it's more like a badly run down hostel. I'm still trying to get my money back.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3016483,2005-19-January,DO NOT HAVE YOUR NEW YORK EXPERIENCE TOTALLY RUINED BY THIS DISGUSTING DUMP DISGUISED UNDER THE NAME OF "HOTEL". Expect cockroaches crawling on the cold flesh of yours and your loved ones' in the middle of the night as apparently the owner thinks heating is not essential in subzero NY winter. If you wanna warm up do not and I repeat do not under any circumstance get into the shower. The hot-water faucet fell out when I was in the shower and a gush of boiling lava-like water landed me in ER. So there you go. I am not making any of these up.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR4250419,2005-19-December,Well the first thing you will notice about this hotel is the smell of stale fat from the cafe they share with it... then in the lobby the people that run the hotel cannot speak a word ofenglish so that does not help... the lift was fast that was probably the best thing about it... we stayed in room 803 and when we got there... the bathroom door did not shut properly.. there was mould on the wall by my bed that had been painted over... there was no heating... the draws were broke and the closet door did not close... the television didnt work... the sink in the bathroom leaked.... the good thing going for our room was that we had hot water... unlike some people we spoke to in the lift... and the location was good as it was like 2 seconds from times square... but my god dont stay here... they dont come in and clean the rooms and we had to keep asking for clean towels because they never gave us any... good holiday but the worst hotel ever!!!,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3483780,2005-18-May,A great effort has been made since 1996! Our room was cleaned carpets and bed were too! What a surprise! Some advice in order to have a pleasant stay  l'Htel Carter! It's a better idea to book your room when u arrive at the hotel in order to have a bargain -if u pay cash of course- and u don't have to pay for the key deposit! This is also a great a way to ask for a Cleaner room that is renovated too. Don't hesitate to exchange your used towels at the reception desk during the night when the staff is kinder! The location is perfect and we advise u to spend your time outside visiting NYC! The quality is correct for the price u pay. It's not a Palace at all.......,richylyon
UR3373755,2005-18-April,I have been in hostels and hotels of all type in New York but never experienced as bad as Carter hotel and let me tell you why. The first room we had; the bathroom door did not close tv only had about 4 channels (in all rooms) the floor was very dirty and I dont think this hotel owns a vacuum cleaner at all cause I did not see it NOT EVEN ONCE and they never cleaned the floors of the room during our 3 week stay. And if you think you are alone in the room think again cuz if you look down mice are running all over the room and in the hallways aswell. There are MICE everywhere in this hotel you can hear them running inside walls and when you sleep they runnin in your room so if you plannin to stay in this "rat hole" do not bring food in the room cause the mice WILL be eatin it instead of you! We checked about 6 rooms cause we asked to change the room after seeing the mice all rooms were as bad and with mice. However if you for some weird reason want to stay in this hotel ask for corner room cause it has the most light and space in it and I think corner room is best of this hotel. Only good thing in it was the location and own bathrooms which were ok. The staff is very very rude and do not understand english well they did tell me " MISS WE CANNOT CATCH MICE" AND LAUGHED AT ME....,unhappycamper
UR3673807,2005-17-July,My friend and I decided to go to New York City by ourselves before we head off to college. Due to our limited finances we chose Hotel Carter due to its cheap prices. Well you get what you pay for. THe decor is nothing to be admired and it took a while to get a room key as two people bickered behing the glass. Our room was fairly clean (no bugs or rodents) but the sheets were stained and the mirrors were dirty. This hotel is only good for young people kids should not be brought here. Bring Lysol and your own sheets and keep your flip-flops on while in the shower and you'll be fine. Would I stay there again no but it served its purpase and I was able to eat at nicer restaurants with the money that I saved from staying at this hotel.,headed2nyc
UR3011717,2005-17-January,The Carter Hotel was the first experience of America for my daughter and myself. We arrived at the entrance and we could see the place had seen better days. Nothing was clean and all the furniture was well past its best. The biggest suprise was the unusual use of carpets as a wall covering. The interior of the room was like something from an old murder movie. Unlike some guests our shower was hot and quite powerful and luckily we had no bugs. We made the best of the location and spent only sleeping hours in our room. We didnt let the awful hotel room ruin our five nights in NYC. The best thing that the Carter Hotel has going for it is the tall black porter who was always on duty and never failed to give a welcoming smile when we were leaving or returning to our room,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3780932,2005-17-August,I made my reservation thru internet and I was charged in my credit card for the 3 nights booked when I was trying to do my check in an old and rude chinese lady told me (in her bad english) that she did not know nothing about it and that I had to pay again I did it and a few hours later thanks that they have a very gentle an efficient guy (english and spanish speaker)in the staff we could clarify the situation and he made the refund to my credit card. The room was cleaned only once during my stay. The problems with the staff continue and in my last night another chinese guy called me at midnight! saying that I had to go to the front desk to clarify some payment issues because I was sleeeping I said him that wait until the morning of the next day and in a rude tone he accepted the issue was clarified again in the morning and I was right he did not apologized for his mistake and the midnight call. Talking about the room is small but works for a maximum of three nights AC is noisy but works and the shower pressure is excellent better that in a five stars hotel the beds are good and the lining is very good and clean. In summary if they change the chinese staff the stay will be acceptable and more comfortable! Location is excellent and also the price!,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3777048,2005-16-August,I would think in good ole USA with our code enforced policies and health agencies that a hotel as bad as this one would be condemed. I can not even imagine the bacteria viruses and disease floating around this flea bag hotel. I would suggest to everyone contemplating a visit to New York to either save a little more money or use the all american plastic and stay at a higher priced hotel because in this instance "Money Really Does buy Happiness". This is by far the worst hotel I ever seen or stayed in within the USA borders. I now know why you are expected to pay for your room at the time of making the reservation because there are very few people that would stay after viewing the lobby let alone the rooms if not pre paid. I am disappointed in New York for allowing such a hotel to tarnish its patriotic state. SHUT IT DOWN BEFORE YOU FIND SOMEONE DEAD AND STUFFED IN A MATRESS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It has only been three days since my stay I am still leary that I may have some horrible disease virus or bacteria just lurking waiting to rear its ugly head.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR4113251,2005-15-November,First of all the staff are nasty rude people not too much english. The whole place smells like fried cabbage the room was about 10X10 carpet for a head board people had wrote their names on the wall in are room nasty dirty carpet that was pieced together out of probably five pieces (remember the room size is only 10 X 10). When you turned on the shower rust comes out and the water doesn't go down the drain so you have to stand in dirty water up to your knees while you take a shower. The carter "hotel" is the only place I know where you take a shower and come out more dirty then you went in. I made the mistake of booking at the carter off a website before reading the reviews I figured it's in time square....how bad could it be....BAD BAD BAD! The pictures of the rooms on the Carter website are not accurate at all. Some people may have the perception that well your just fussy well just so you know i'm 30 yrs old and my wife is only 28 were very middle class people and are not particular at all but I don't think a clean place to sleep and an working shower is too much to ask for luckily we drove into the city so we packed are own sheet and comforter otherwise we would have been trying to find another room or going to buy sheets etc. We didn't even attempt to break down the bed. Also we only stayed for two nights and explored the city about 16 hrs each day so we spent as little time at the carter as possible. I felt really bad for the people who had kids because they had no choice but to spend a lot of their vacation in that slum. Anyway the only good thing about the carter is the location but it's not worth it next time i'll stay across town in a real hotel. good Luck!,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3474523,2005-15-May,This is worse than terrible although I guess the fact that you can check out makes it better than spending the night at Rikers. Okay it's cheap. And there are sheets on the beds and at least one towel in the bathroom. There is a lock on the door although one hard shoulder push could probably take care of that. The lobby is an eye-opener - cheap dirty "persian" carpets stitched together lots of dirty mirrors neon lights a bank of static-filled TVs hopeless looking people sitting on the floor. Very "Blade Runner". If you've ever wondered what happens to those couches you see abandonded on street corners well here they are! Plan on a lengthy and loud argument with the front desk clerk if you want a receipt or you want to check out early. Cross your fingers when you get in that elevator. Surprisingly my room had a nice view of the Hudson River and a big closet. The rest was just really bad. Sleep in your clothes please. Don't even think about walking around barefooted don't open any unnecessary drawers (a bloody used band-aid sound nice?) The room's smoke detector was in the top drawer (???) which was troubling. If you're a starving student traveling with a backpack love hostels or crashing in airports and parks to save the $$ this might be an okay place for you (and you'll have some great stories to tell about the wildlife you found roaming your room). Anyone else spring for the extra $20 and stay somewhere else. By the way there's GREAT public transportation in NYC so it's REALLY not necessary to stay near Times Square to get around easily and see all the sights.,amontgomery
UR3274405,2005-15-March,You cannot get any more central than this hotel. We stayed there for 5 nights in July 2004. Like other people who gave their reviews we had a bathroom door that didn't close a disgusting damp carpet on the floor and on the walls behind the bed a television with little reception totally ignorant staff who could not comprehend or speak english properly. Oh there was one really cute coloured guy working as the doorman who was very helpful:-) I was trying to arrange to meet up with a friend and they had left several messages at the hotel for me. When I asked for the messages at reception they got irritated and told me there were none yet messages appeared under the door the following morning. It was as if she was too lazy to get up and check for me. I guess we were the lucky ones as we managed to get a clean-ish bathroom with hot water (although the taps fell off regularly) clean sheets a window that closed and working air conditioning. I can't imagine the room door would have stopped anybody from getting into the room either but we had a ball there. All we wanted was a bed to sleep in that was central and cheap and that's what we got.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3193442,2005-15-February,Come & stay at the Carter Hotel & Jeopardise your & your family's health! 5 nights we spend there (our first time ever in the states)  and I can afterwards say to you all that this is a TERRIBLE terrible hotel. Like someone else mentioned in their review the employees there dont even seem to care! And yet my boyfriend and I can consider ourselves two of the "lucky" guests who stayed at the Carter Hotel. The reason for that is that compared to our fellow guests we were lucky enough not to find blood on the "clean" sheets of our bed or find our 7 month old baby playing with a dead rat in the morning. (!) We were lucky and only found one dead cockroach under the bed (by the way if you are going there dont look under the bed!) and frankly who needs to have a door you can shut to the bathroom?(!). Honestly people this hotel is situated on a great spot of NYC but it just aint worth it I tell you. But hey If you dont mind any of the above listed incidents that all happened when I was there then I wont stop you I am just trying to save people's maybe first time experience of New York & the states because I certainly wont forget this awful hotel in a long long long time.,erikahelena
UR3767240,2005-15-August,I just checked out today and boy am I glad to be home. This hotel is a nightmare so please pay close attention to my words so you can avoid this experience. This past weekend I checked into The Carter Hotel. Hmm.... my room was supposed to be a "King" sized bed. Well little did I know that at this hotel we join two double beds together and call it a King size. The carpets haven't been vacuumed for nearly forty years. Let's not even talk about the air condition if you were hot........ its better to burn in hell. keep your clothes inside your bags at all times because the drawers and the closet is filthy. I mean just disgusting with bug craps and all. Do not even think about taking a relaxing shower because the shower curtains haven't been changed and the bathtub hasn't been scrubbed for years. Need privacy in the bathroom? Forget about it. I don't know which carpenters these people hired because the measurement of the door were not accurate so it doesn't close. The curtains in your room were sewn in the early 60's. You only get two towels so use your towels wisely or not even at all. Be careful with the bathroom water when you first turn it on because the water is brown. You don't get room service everyday. Its either after two days or none. For those of you that enjoys watching tv please sit close because there are no remote controls. The tv's are so old and then you have no antenna and you have to keep twisting and turning the channels. The hotel staff is so rude and you can bearly understand them. I mean this hotel is cheap for its location but is it worth killing your trip? So make a wise decision before you pick this hotel. It needs to be shut down or renovated immediately!!!!!!!!,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3550405,2005-14-June,First of all let me start off by saying that the price was very reasonable BUT that is the only good thing I can say about this hotel. When we got there of course there was a problem with the reservation but that was cleared up quickly. Upon entering the elevator the smell was awful!! We get to our room and the door is locked from the inside. Somebody was already in our room. Back down to the front desk and get another room. They dont even know who is staying in what room. We go back upstairs to our second room open the door and I was never so horrified in my life! The only thing that was clean in that room was the sheets and the towels! There was stuff that I have no idea what is was on the walls. It looked like spit. No lamp shades on the lights that were on the walls. The bathroom was another story. The door would not close tiles were missing around the shower the toilet had so much caulk around the bottom that you were afraid to sit on it. The shower was so disgusting that you didn't even want to use it in fear that you might catch something. It kind of puts a damper on your vacation. My sister and her friend (who are from OK.) came with us and they were equally horrified. I think that they should change their pictures on their website to more accurate ones. My room certaintly didn't look like their pictures!! I would not recommend that anybody stay at this hotel. And the website that books these rooms should be ashamed of themselves!!!,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3761360,2005-14-August,This hotel is okay for young people. I would not recommend it to older people or people with small children. The room had a a funny smell luckily I had some Febreeze in my bag. The tub drain was very very very slow! I took my showers before the other 2 that was with me otherwise I would've been standing in over ankle deep water. On the other hand the location was awesome!! Times Square was half a block up the street! You can not beat the price or the location. The staff was a little rude. I did here some people argueing and the customers were being really rude. If you're nice to them they'll be nice to you. Here is some very helpful advice: If you need any help look for a tall black man that wears a tie. He looks like a manager. He is very nice. I think his name was Abdul. Who goes to NYC to sit in a hotel room all day anyways?,A TripAdvisor Member
UR4109788,2005-13-November,All I can say...is OH MY GOD. Were do I start! From the outside you think to yourself its not so bad! Then you get inside and it begins at reception! The receptionists well customer service ain't their best quality. It did make me think when I saw that they were seated behind windows with only a little gap to pass paperwork through how bad can this place be? After that experience you get to your room in a lift that looks like its seen better days. Then you open a door to the 1930s. The 1st room was well how can I put it - DISGUSTING. I don't think the room was decorated the bedding had a really bad smell and there were things growing in the bathroom and it wasn't a plant! Room number 3 seemed bearable but the room was occupied. Makes ya think is your stuff safe!! Room number 4 on the search for something decent well after a shower the ceiling in the bathroom decided to crumble!! Room number 5 was the best of a bad bunch. What I did want to know is what is with the carpets on the walls? What are they hidding? If you stay here and ask to change rooms you will not be the only ones requesting this. Also they have safety deposit boxes if you ask to put anything in them like your passports - well it goes in an envelope and is then chucked on the floor underneath the receptionists counter. - Safe eh!! Take my advise - don't stay here. It is not only a dump but Im sure its a health hazard!,helmel49
UR3005214,2005-13-January,I have stayed at better hotels in the third world no kidding. The NYPD was always in the lobby writing police reports about thefts that happened in the hotel. I discovered that my room key opened every door on the fifth floor. Stay away I was lucky and did not get ripped off but I heard and saw horrible stories and situations.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR4240857,2005-13-December,The carter hotel what a dump!!! After arriving from london england on a 8.5 flight all we wanted to do was to have a bed to sleep in we arrived by taxi to the hotel as we got passed the double doors there was about 50 people in the que waiting to be checked in after about 1 hour in the que we was wondering what was happening there was people leaving the reception saying they don't have any rooms it is double book! even if u have a reservation and paid in advance through a travel agent. we didn't even make it to the desk to be told by the owner of the hotel (who looked like fonzy from happy days )to get out as we are double book and find somewhere else to stay as no one is staying here as the hotel is double book i tired to call a number on booking form of which was was left on hold for 40 mins then cut off when hotel carter name was mentioned we had to get a yellow pages and find somewhere else to stay at our expense walking through time square with our bags in rush hour this ruined our holiday as we had to pay over $600 to stay in other hotels for 4days we return to the carter a day later to see if they had any rooms but they were still double booked!! this hotel is a joke and should be closed down still trying to get some money back from these cowboys which they still have our money.Do not stay here please it is not even 1*,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3355554,2005-13-April,Myself and two of my friends stayed in the Carter for 3nts just before Christmas (Dec 2004) i've been meaning to write a review since but haven't gotten round to it!! I was backpacking for 6 months last year and thought to myself 'the reviews sound bad but surely it's just whingers who write on here and nothing could be worse than some of the backpackers places that i've stayed??' .........Wrong!!! The Carter surpassed all expectations of disgutingness!!! When we walked in the musty smell hits you the Chinese empire who are running it don't seem to know the meaning of Customer Services and good customer relations and are so rude it's laughable!! We then got in the lift (I was pleasantly surprised there was one!) and we checked into our room a triple. The bathroom was fairly clean but the toilet did have a tendency to leak everytime you flushed it we did have hot water each time we showered and the shower was quite nice and powerful and certainly warmed you up - it would need to we didn't have any heating and had holes in the windows!! The carpet in the room was a mishmash of different pieces and so dirty i didn't want to walk on it with bare feet! The television didn't work and as for the phone other people talk about i don't think we even had one! This place is certainly an absolute steal budget wise and if you really can't afford anything more it is a fantastic location and close to everything but there are other budget hotels out there which i would of personally rather spent my money on.,Doms-travels
UR3898033,2005-12-September,Served me right for ignoring the reviews. This place really is a dump. I was nearly afraid to sleep in the bed and the towels were so thing it was impossible to use them to dry off. The lobby was filthy and the staff impolite. And after the internet rate of $105 they still had the cheek to have a non-refundable key charge. There are ok budget hotels in NYC - but this is not one.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR4017714,2005-12-October,we stayed here & was the worst experience of our lives .!! the rooms were dirty & a health hazard staff were very rude & unhelpful do not give them the satisfaction or your money. the room dripped water and plaster came off the ceiling. We have stayed in budget hotels before but this is off the scale place should be condemmed.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3661886,2005-12-July,IT IS DISGUSTING it looked like a place that a hooker would use for the hour. the room was dirty no remote for tv no cable no pictures on the walls the comforters were thread bare. one lightbulb in the ceiling. it smelled.do not go here!!!!!!!,A TripAdvisor Member
UR4233415,2005-12-December,1 dolla for a key 2 dolla for another key nonrefundable. room dirty dirty blood stained sheets with lots of hair; room lacks all amenities; if you must stay bring your own sheets pillows blankets and bathroom necessities we checked in late and left early.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3754541,2005-11-August,The day I received my vouchers for a trip to NYC and Florida I read the reviews here on tripadvisor.com so I was prepared for the absolute worst! I was pleasantly surprised to find out Hotel Carter isn't quite the absolute hell hole I imagined (and read) . Okay the lobby looks like it has been ramsacked the staff is mostly rude and totally unfamilliair with terms as hospitality and service the rooms are small and were never cleaned during our stay the ac is noisy but working the hallways look like second hand carpetshops (do they exist?) the TV has no remote the lamp has no lampshade towels are thin as tissues and hard as sandpaper the bathroom is mouldy but the waterpressure is enourmous! The room had been cleaned before check-in the beds weren't too bad and the location is just great only steps away from Times Square. We didn't get killed mugged or infected during our stay. We've seen better not worse. But then again.. who needs luxury for a few days in the Big Apple?,dutchbloke
UR4103314,2005-10-November,Nothing could have prepared us for the nightmare we lived at the Carter Hotel!! We chose a very bad moment to go to NY all the budget hotels were booked due to the Columbus Day Parade so against all the bad revues we had read we decided to book a room through a company called Cosytel which advertises on the Rand McNAlly web page so we thought it would be reliable and serious which proved to be our first major mistake!! After promising to charge us to our credit card ONLY $90 to ensure the reservation they ended up charging us for the total amount we were supposed to pay at the end of our stay close to $700 for 5 nights. Not satisfied with this they proceeded to CANCEL our reservation! So upon our arrival in NY after a long journey from Venezuela we were told by a very unpleasant and rude Chinese lady who seems to be the owner's wife that they didn't have a room for us!! After several unanswered calls to Cosytel we decided to literally beg Dragon Lady for a room mistake number 2!!! After 2 hours waiting for an answer we were told they indeed had a room for us but that we had to pay again for it at a higher price of course since they had never received any payment from us or from Cosytel. Tired as we were we proceeded to pay and go up to our room not before noticing all the people complaining at the reception about something or the other !!! To say that the room was a dump would be an understatement!! The bathroom- which ages ago had white tiles- was black! The grouting between the tiles was completely gone leaving room to disgusting mold!!! We had to go to a drugstore near the hotel to buy chlorine wipes to try to make this pigstay usable by humans!! The room is an accident waiting to happen the fire dpt. should inspect it the filter of the old air conditioning unit was completelly cover with lint which prevented it from blowing any fresh air so the room at first was quite warm and the air rancid we had to wash it in the shower before being able to use it properly. The carpet was filthy the tv. was almost useless could be heard but not seen and obviously there was no cable tv! The only good thing about this place is the location unbeatable! Half a bolck away from Times Sq. many theaters the subway station great stores and all taht makes NY city the great place we love!! So do yourself a favor stay away from this over-priced rundown dump!!,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3654637,2005-10-July,I didn't read any reviews before I stayed at Hotel Carter but in reading them now I wish I had. Refurbished? That's a stretch. If gluing old oriental rugs to the walls and floors to cover lord only knows what then yes the hotel is refurbished. I never saw rodents but when it came to the bathroom the toilet leaked and I showered with my eyes closed. The bedsheets appeared to be clean but the comforters did not. To top it off the TV worked but in the end it didn't matter since we couldn't stand to be there any longer than absolutely necessary. Cheap but truly not cheap enough.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3430035,2005-1-May,oh my god. all i am going to say is how the hell is this dump allowed to stay open. i don't know how many diseases are floating around this 'hotel' but i've seen drug addicts mice and prostitutes here as well as the most obnoxious staff who pretend not to speak english and then try to keep your deposit. if you are going to stay here i would advise you to think again and sleep on a park bench or bus shelter because its a hundred times more comfortable and a lot safer. this place should be closed down.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2968797,2005-1-January,Where do I start well first when you enter the lobby you think your in china because it smells like a wok. Next when you go to check in the staff is rude I mean rude they finally got the cards to enter the room not the keys this was my second stay I thought i would give it a second chance but again it was horrible room was dirty running water in the bathroom had a little flood televison didnt work telepone also didnt work they dont give towels shampoo or soap with your room little criters crawling all ove its a totla health hazard dont have lampsjust a light bulb on the ceiling that didnt work heat didnt work no hot water no windows that opened to freshen the room up stay away if you value your health and personel property. SOme scary people lurk the halways at night but its not worth the 93.00 they charge they should be shut down by the city....... Enter if you dare,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3727354,2005-1-August,I stayed in the Carter Hotel for 2 nights this is how it went: -When I arrived there was a kind of slow moving line to check in and to complain you could hear people saying how awful was the hotel some italian guys were complaining that they had a mouse in their room. -My turn to check in arrived luckily for me the guy that was handling my reservation was from the Dominican Republic I am from Puerto Rico so I started to talk to him in spanish and we kind of clicked. He gave me a key from a room and told me that before we would charge my credit card he wanted me to see if I like the room. As I went to my room (8th floor) the beds were unmade the room had trash from other guests the bathroom was dirty with a lot of mold in the ceiling and in the walls and one of the beds had a big red stain in the sheets. -As I went to the lobby I told him that I didn't liked the room so he gave me another key from a different room (7th floor). Luckily for me this room was way better than the one before the beds were made it had clean sheets and towels the bathroom was clean the only thing dirty in the room was the shower curtain and the carpet aside from that everything was ok. -I was very pleased to spend just 60 dollars in a hotel for two nights (total cost were $240 we were four staying in the room). I worked out for me and for my friends. -If you plan to stay at this hotel try to make friends with the staff (try the latin staff I don't think the asian staff are very friendly) and with Angel he is the Cuban-Puertorican bellboy handyman of the hotel he'll help you with anything. Don't expect to receive room service which I think is safer because you wouldn't have the "maid" going through your stuff. -Overall I had a great time in NY I spent my money on Broadway shows and tours and not in the hotel. If you are a student like me and you are traveling with friends and if you have some patience the Hotel Carter will work for you,Gab2005
UR2518633,2004-8-September,There is nothing good to say about this hotel except that the bellman/locksmith was very helpful. The entire hotel is filthy. I'm talking FILTHY. Broken water fixtures leaks severely stained linen bugs .....the works. It should be listed in the hourly rate section. We have no problem staying in not so pleasant hotels to save a buck but we checked out of this one within 1 hour after checking in. Do not stay here under any circumstances! You might be better off taking your chances sleeping in Central Park.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR1878195,2004-6-May,We stayed in NYC for about a week and we didn't want to spend too much money for the hotel so we decided to choose hotel Carter. The first thing I thought once we got in the hotel was 'What a hell of a smell'. We tried to check in but the lady was very rude; our reservation seemed to be a problem because we had a wrong voucher according to her... We tried to explain her we had already paid for the room and it took 15 minutes before she finally gave us the key of the room. The ugly carpet on the floor was filthy and the sheets were not clean at all. The bathroom was okay and the tv was crap. The only positive thing was the location...,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2865818,2004-6-December,Where do I start? I appreciate I was in New York to see this wonderful city - and not the inside of a hotel room - but a modicum of cleanliness would have been nice. The bed was large comfy and relatively clean - even though it had holes in the sheets. If it hadn't have been for the filfth and grime under the bed behind the drawers and in the cupboard things would have been OK. The shower was OK - when it worked and there was hot water but on the occasions it didn't and there wasn't you left the bathroom feeling dirty. A nice touch was the persistent clunking and thumping of the insane radiator EACH and EVERY day for our six night sojorn. We couldn't open the room door twice and oh we had a mouse in the room on the last morning. The staff were friendly enough but ambivalent about the state of the place. The bell boy - not the brighest button in the box - summed it up when he said 'i don't care - they don't pay me enough' and berated the people who complained to him about the state of the place saying he refused to help those who moaned. I lost count of the number of people who were visibly upset and angered by the state of the place. I witnessed several people check-in and then immediately check-out again because they claimed it should have been shut down by environmental health. It's true that you live and learn and more often than not get what you pay for in life but even so the Carter Hotel's boast of being the cheapest hotel in NYC is no reason to stay there. 'Our rates will warm you up' is a neon sign that hangs by the entrance. They didn't. Never again.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2807402,2004-5-November,This is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in - and that is saying much as I have also travel in 3rd world countries... The reception staff was rude obnoxious and minding their own business. The rooms were never cleaned - unless requested (after the 3rd request of the day someone did a half-hearted tidy up) the room was so dirty and disgusting (when we checked in there were dirty sheets in a pile at the bottom of the wardrobe - did I touch them? noooo!) I tried not looking under the beds in the corners or at the bathtub too closely.. Totally disgusting. I mean budgeting is ok but there is no excuse for this filthy unfriendly place to exist! I think someone should close them down. The hotel also seemed to be the Falun Gong HQ in NY which was not very nice either... imagine having your filthy hotel experience combined with crowds of people in a trance in the lobby - coupled with pictures of mutilated people that they were parading.... They almost ruined my holiday I'm afraid.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2796699,2004-30-October,This must be one of the world's worst hotels. Take my advice and never stay there. Just spent four days in this hell-hole. The rooms are filthy and grotty the sheets weren't clean. There is carpet on the walls (probably to cover up the stains). I have never met people as rude as the management were. The lobby is covered in pink and blue neon lights and carpet yes carpet everywhere. They will try to sell you cheap watched at reception and girls after midnight. There is no dining room or restaurant so you are given coupons to get a drink and sandwich from a dirty little 24Hr street shop that is part of the hotel building. The decor is undescribable smell awful etc. etc. This really is the hotel from hell. Also it is not safe there is inadequate security and the locks on the doors do not work. The fire escape routes showed floor plans from a different hotel!! And finally believe it or not to top off the prostitutes that were in the lobby at night there was a man who lived behind a vending machine in a small gap whom the staff did nothing about. Please take my advice - don't stay there. However it does have a fantastic location (about 100m from Times Square) but that makes it very noisy (especially with thin glass windows you wont be able to sleep). IF YOU CAN'T AFFORD ANYWHERE ELSE THEN BRING A SLEEPING BAG - THE SHEETS ARE INFESTED.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2856439,2004-30-November,Not fit for a SEWAR RAT to live - Disgusting and Unsafe!!!!!!!!! DO NOT BOOK CARTER - should be closed due to Health and Safety. Do not know how travel companies can advertise such a disgusting hotel to foreign travellers and get away with the money they have charged them for what is supposed to be a BUDGET hotel NO WAY is this budget - I booked out within hours of arriving.

UR2966155,2004-30-December,This hotel is a disgrace to the wonderful city of New York. We reserved this hotel online 2 weeks prior to arrival and received confirmation (just a reply email no confirmation number). We failed to check this website and it turned out to be our biggest mistake. The first red flag was raised when I tried to call one day prior to arrival to find out if they had an iron board and hair blower in the room (One can never assume anything). The toll free 800 number was always busy which was something unusual. When I called the regular number the phone was answered by a real person but only with a greeting "May I help you?". I had to asked if this was hotel Carter and she said yes. I complained about the toll free number being busy and she cut me off saying that many people called the hotel. I asked if the room had a hair blower and an ironing board and she said no. We arrived late and upon checking in we were told that there was no room for us. How outrageous! Since there were 2 parties that were traveling we reserved 2 rooms and received confirmation for 2 rooms. Now they were telling us there was no room and no apology. I'm not sure if the staff does not understand English or they pretend not to understand English when it comes to confrontation. After hours of waiting we found an Asian guy in the hallway who told us that he was one of the 2 maintenance guys for this hotel but because he was sick he was not on duty that night. How can a 700 room hotel only have 2 maintenance staff? He showed us a room but it was a storage room rather than a hotel room. There were all sorts of furniture and black plastic garbage bags piling in the room and in the closet. There was no light fixture the whole room was lit by a naked 25 watt light bulb on the ceiling. I thought I was in a holding cell. The room was dusty and stunk. They tried to make the bed and cleared out all the debris in the room but when they almost finished vacuuming the room the other maintenance guy was called to handle another emergency (turned out that this hotel has millions of emergencies because NOTHING works). There was NO towel in the room and when we asked for towels the off duty maintenance guy told us to go to the maid closet to get them ourselves! The room key did not work so we were locked out of our room for a long time. We went down to front desk and management grabbed the maintenance guy when he exited from the elevators. The maintenance staff did not even have a walkie talkie or any other devices to help them do their jobs. The minute he showed up a whole crowd of customers bombarded him with problems and issues I had to dragged him to our floor to have him take care of my problem before others started taking over. We had to fight to get our problems taking care of! The bathroom door knob was missing so the hotel tied a string from the door to the wall so we could open the bathroom door! There was NO hot water I'm not sure if there was heat in the room (luckily for us we were there on Thanksgivine week and the temperature was in the 40s and 50s so it was not so cold). We were awaken 3 times that night because the heat was so old that it cranked up and made horrible loud noises. There were only 3 elevators in the hotel and the night we were there only two were in operations and we ended up having to use stairs to get to our 5th floor room. The other party was not so lucky they ended up on the 21st floor so they had to wait for 10-15 minutes for the elevator each time. We ended up not daring to leave our rooms because we did not want to be subject to other "surprises". We checked out the next day and vowed NEVER to come back. Advice to the next traveler: Do not be fooled by their cheap price. It's not worth it. By staying in this hotel you subject yourself to compromising hygiene situations and countless outrageous customer service nightmares. I have traveled to developing countries and am used to substandard accomodations and service. Nothing compares to my hotel Carter experience perhaps because Carter is in the heart of New York right in Times Square one would expect them to maintain at least a clean and functional place for tourists to spend the night. This hotel is far from being clean and functional. It is a dump and in my opinion for approximately $100/ night a very reasonable price comparing to New York standard you end up paying too much. I intend to write to the City of New York's BBBs the Department of Consumer Affairs and the city's Health Department about this experience. The fact that Carter hotel continues to be in operations in light of all these complaints remain a mystery to me.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2502083,2004-30-August,Just disgusting like the people at the reception desk! They cannot speak English and they are very rude. You feel like you are talking to Ms. Swan in "Mad TV"!!!!!! Don't go there!,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2853652,2004-29-November,my mother and another single parent friend of ours planned this Thanksgiving trip about a month ago online. We were looking for something cheap but after we stepped foot into this hotel we were completely disgusted. At first we just laughed at the missmatched carpets and furniture the neon lights and the smell. But when we got to our room we had to try and open the door for over 10 minutes. But that was not even half of it. We walked into a room that must have never been cleaned from the last person who was in there. There were shoes left behind and a razor in the bathub the closet was filled with garbage and the room smelt horrible. If your okay with that then thats another story but may i add there was no electric let alone cable or atleast one light the beds were un-made and the bathroom's were not to even be touched. We kindly went down to the lobby and we had a man bring us up there with a key. The mad tried several rooms all of them had people in there still. He did not even knock. Finally we recieved a room. This room also smeltand the bathroom had flood on the floor by this time we were completly disgusted but we had no choice. The manager said he would get us a room tomorrow that was better. That was a lie. The only reason we stayed was because we had no choice there was nothing else available for that day. By this time all of our Thanksgiving was ruined we were all stressed out and grossed out. We all could not get a wink of sleep that whole night the sheets had hair and holes the matress was filled with holes and layers of dirt. The entire night we heard rats scurrying. Or what we thought but there assumtions were true  because the next morning we found out that there were rats in another womens room that night. By this time we were all passed the point of stressed out. We thought that maybe if we got out of the rooms that it would not be that bad but it was. All we thought about was how disgusting we felt with no showers and god knows what was on our bodies. When we went back to our room there were people meditating right in front of our door which we could not open after several minutes the door knob fell completly off the door. We had to get out of there. I hope that this bit of imformation helps you to not choose this hotel. Our whole vacation was ruined we were not able to go out for our Thanksgiving dinner because we missed our reservation. This is just clue of how inconsiderate these people were.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR1750396,2004-29-March,The room was relatively clean but looked like it hadn't been remodeled since 1940. The faucet handles fell off while I was in the shower and the sink leaked water when turned on. The location is great; only a block from Broadway! Instead of wallpaper there was colorful carpet on the walls. When you're in the lobby make sure that your watch has the correct time on it...or else you may be a little confused. Overall it was fine but not someplace that I would ever stay again.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2229286,2004-29-June,we went to carter because it was a great deal but looking back we should have spent another $100.00 to go anywhere else!! we just went to New York for a weekend so for two nights we stayed at Carter Hotel. The service is crap not enough towels the water fills up in the bath tub when you take a shower ( a lot!) there is carpet on the walls which means dust infestation! we fortunately did not see any cockroaches but the parking lot stinks of garbage and there are quite a few rats ready to jump in your car so close all your windows and do not leave ANY food!!! The hotel lobby is disgusting too. The whole place just looks filthy and dirty so go spend a bit more and stay at the W Ameritania hotel or Holiday Inn whatever. Just don't think about staying here unless your want to make "new friends".,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2605527,2004-28-September,When I went to Carter hotel's website I thought "What a nice website." The hotel itself is a different story. The front desk lady was just MEAN! I had a fight with her as soon as I checked in. That put me in a bad mood. My brother and I booked two double beds and instead we got one double bed. I did not have any more energy to fight for a refund knowing that I would probably never get it. You can't beat the location though. As for price it is good but for what seems like only a "hostel" quality of "hotel" it is NOT that cheap. I've stayed in hostels that are cheaper and much cleaner. The bed sheets were filthy!,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2227020,2004-28-June,The Carter Hotel is absolutely disgusting. The low prices are not worth the agony of staying in this hotel. The hotel staff are all Chinese people who don't speak English and are extremely rude. We killed a HUGE 2 inch cochraoch and a spider in our bathroom. The entire place stinks and is dirty. The carpet in our room had old food stuck in it there was no hot water in the shower the shower was covered with mold and mildew and it took the hotel staff 2 days to bring us washclothes (there were none in the room)!! Every time we called the front desk we were hung up on. Not ONCE in our 3 day stay did they change our bed sheets on give us new towels. There was no cable and the room smelled musty. Whatever you do do not stay at this roach motel.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR1843424,2004-27-April,I went to the Carter for a week at the end of March with my boyfriend. We had read the reviews about it on Tripadvisor but being on a limited budget decided to "brave it" anyway. From the reviews we expected to arrive at a pokey doorway in NY with no hotel sign flashing neon lights in the reception area and druggies hanging around in the reception area. However the Carter is large as life with a big Hotel Carter sign going down the side of the building. Admittedly some of the letters on the sign were not lit up but it was obviously a grand old hotel in it's day. The reception was enormous with oriental designs on the walls and largely made of marble. The clocks above reception all worked and showed the different times in the main countries of the world. The seating was made of leather and was in good condition. We arrived around 9.30pm on a Saturday night and there were couples in reception waiting to be checked in who obviously had made no prior booking... We were allocated our room with no problem and all the lifts worked all throughout our stay. There was never any queue for the lifts. However we did encounter a few young ladies going down in the lifts doing up their clothes and some young men enthusing about the good time they had just had. We stayed in a room on the 10th floor room no 1028. It was a large room with an enormous bed that would quite easily have slept 4 people. We left the room key in the door on the first night by mistake but had no trouble. Yes the decor and carpets etc were dated it reminded me of hotels in 1970's films it was like going back in time but in a reminisscent sort of way. It was clean enough and we saw no cockroaches. Room no 1028 was great. It was on the corner so had 2 windows and was very airy and ight with a great view up the street towards Times Square. The bathroom was clean and we had constant very hot water. The shower was like nothing I have experienced in UK the power was out of this world - had to hold onto the window ledge to avoid being knocked over!. Worth visiting just for the shower power! We left it clean and tidy all the time so did not really notice if cleaners came in but did notice the bins emptied and towels and loo papers replaced a couple of times. Nothing was stolen. The TV had only about 3 channels that were not too fuzzy to watch they were main stations with good films but we did not go to New York to watch TV. Radio stations had good reception. Calls from the room to reception were not answered. The heating as it came on was extremely noisy a bit like a ratchet at a football match but we found it funny and it did not bother us at all. The windows would not stay open by themselves so we held them open with cans of Pringles which worked fine. My main gripe was that on the bed was only a thin eiderdown and it would have been very cold at night had I been alone. They were old grey scratchy material type blankets in the cupboard which looked like old dog blankets which needed chucking in the bin. Would not have considered sleeping under them. Whilst we were there we only saw people on the 10th floor once on the Saturday night and would not have been surprised if we were the only ones staying on that floor for the rest of the time. There was certainly no noise at night apart from the street which was a constant sound of car horns and shouting but nothing to do with the Carter. No-one can expect peace and quiet in central New York. Location was fantastic right in the middle of everything. The price was also v good especially for the location - the equivalent to 158 each for 7 nights - no hidden extras. Gave us extra spending money for outside the hotel which was for us just a base and somewhere to sleep. The staff seemed aloof and cold to start with but as the week progressed and we did not complain they became friendlier. However whilst waiting for my boyfriend in reception one day one poor chap went to reception laden with suitcases and said he was there to check out. The receptionist (they are all of Asian origin) barked "Give me your key" which he did and left without any response such as "Thank you" or "have a good journey" etc. On the last day we were told to check out by 10am and left our bags with the bell boy who put them in a room for $1 for the day. He was the friendliest person there could not have been more friendly. I think it would only take a cosmetic facelift to restore Carter to the grand place it obviously once was. I would stay there again (but not alone being female as would be nervous of someone tryig to pick me up in the lift). Tip - ask for a corner room e.g no 28 on any floor as I understand the rooms not in the corners were dark and not so large and airy. If you want to spend twice as much for all mod cons do not stay at the Carter. However if you want a basic place to sleep and do not expect room service up tp date decor etc the Carter is OK. You get what you pay for.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2786505,2004-26-October,Just returned from 3 nights at the Carter and we survived - but would only return if it was a last resort (as it was this time). I usually book through Priceline and have gotten great hotels at great prices - but a group of 5 made a last minute trip and EVERY HOTEL Hostel and YMCA in Manhattan seemed to be booked unless we wanted to spent more than $450 per night (and even those rooms were tight for all 3 nights). Since the group was on a budget - we booked the Carter which I've known has had a bad reputation for years - but the group agreed that they would rather spend the extra $1000 per room shopping rather than booking a more expensive hotel. We all survived - didn't spend much time in the room - the bed was OK and plenty of heat and hot water - but as mentioned comes out a strange brown color at first... The rooms have keys that you have to play with to get them to work... and I suspect that many people don't return them for the $1 deposit so there may be many of them circulating... Use the deposit boxes in the lobby if you have concerns... Our room was dirty when we got there - and the front desk very nicely advised us that it would eventually be cleaned... just wait... We had two rooms - both had their own quirks - peeling paint bare bulbs broken/no headboards dirty towels in the closet spliced extension cord inventions that I'm sure are illegal by any electrical code TV with few channels no hangers clean but apparently stained sheets bathroom doors that didn't close - or wouldn't open if pushed tight no decoration of any kind.... and the doorknob pulled out in your hand whenever pulled... although they did fix that after a complaint. I wasn't brave enough to look under the beds! The maid didn't come after 2 days so the front desk very nicely advised that maid service was every other day - but that the hotel was full so that they weren't surprised that they didn't clean - but had towels and toilet tissue at the front desk. Now if you know this before you go - you can probably deal with it when the alternative is no hotel at all or paying lots more money. But a steady stream of people arrived expecting a real hotel and were in shock. As mentioned in other reviews Abdul is the best resorce for getting any attention and he is very effective in resolving situations - its amazing that another hotel hasn't hired him away... The younger girls at the front desk are sweet and accommodating but can't do much other than give towels etc. Avoid any of the older employees - you will just get yourself upset.... So - if you just need a bed for the night and don't ASSUME anything except a cheap price - you'll most likely survive your experience and have stories to tell for years.... But if you expect even minimal standards you'll want to pay more for something else if you can find it.... This is at best a one-star hotel - and only gets this rating due to the private bathrooms... They are putting down lots of new oriental rugs all over the hotel to 'spruce it up' - but I suspect that this hotel will eventually be converted into a more expensive hotel due to its size and location.... It could be a very nice budget hotel with just a little work - but then the price would undoubtably increase by at least double. There were lots of European tour groups there - and its amazing that any tour operator who has stayed there would send clients to the hotel - Europeans have a tradition of staying at budget hotels - but they are usually spotlessly clean and attentive to customers.... but then again the goups may be happy to trade the cheap price for the opportunity to spend their money shopping rather than sleeping.... There was lots of activity in the hotel by the Falun Gong religious/protest group - not sure if they were staying there or if this is part of their operation like the old New Yorker Hotel was associated with another religious group. All of the members were very nice and there is a table set up in the lobby for group meditation. The deli at street level is small but open 24 hours and of course all of Times Square is at your doorstep... So considering the situation - I am not unhappy with my decision to stay at the Carter considering the booking situation at all the other hotels - but won't be in a hurry to return. If nothing else a stay at the Carter will make you appreciate the standards and levels of quality that are enforced by the 'branded' budget chain hotels like comfort hojo express quality where you can have reasonable expections of what you will get...,gungo
UR2224009,2004-26-June,I stayed at the carter with my friends from Denmark. The best person to ask for anything is the tall black guy "Abdul". He is great. other than that the place is you get what you pay for!! Karen,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2846363,2004-25-November,Me and my friend were on a low budget holiday to the United States and Canada so naturally we were looking for a cheap place to stay with good location! After days of searching on the Internet I came across Carter Hotel. It was well cheap especially for the other prices in New York; we were paying 40 per night. So I booked the hotel online. A few days later my friend called me telling me that she had been online and looked at reviews of Carter from other people who had stayed there and to be honest all the reviews gave a negative image of the hotel. I reassured my friend that it should be fine and that we can't get a better deal than that unless she wants a youth hostel which has shared facilities! But deep down I wanted to cry I was reluctant to even start my trip. I looked at the confirmation of the hotel and we could not cancel at such short notice. Ok so now we are standing in the lobby of the hotel I cant even begin to write what this was like all the decor was mismatched there were red neon lights with extremely dirty dark carpet and it was different carpets in different parts of the lobby and there was this strange smell! We got our keys from the reception the room was prepared for us and they had received our confirmation. OK hold your breath because I was the lady at the desk asked the hotel porter to assist us with our luggage we had big suitcases we turned around and wait for it...YES there was a very old man about 75 years old. Small looked like he was about to snap! And he was to carry our luggage; I took my own bags because I felt sorry for him. Anyway went to the room the door was jammed and the old man had to kick it to open and this had to be done every time we wanted to enter the room. In the hallway outside our room there was carpet on the walls! One thing that carter did not know about was decorating Im sure that Ann Maurice of house doctor is from the USA; carter should be her next project! We walked into our room and we were like yes its ok for what we are paying but both our faces had disappointed looks on them! We tried to unpack and put things in the closet but it was jammed and we could not open in so we were living out of suitcases. The television had one channel with no reception! The view from our hotel was not even looked at it was of the rubbish tip! No light came into our room. I was lucky that I bought my bed sheets in because the ones they provided had yellow stains on them! I touched my headboard and it dropped off! The bed was being held on some metal wheeling trolley and if I turned at night my mattress will fall of the metal things! The shower was good it was a good power shower and sorted my back out. BUT..........the drains clogged up and u had all your dirt swimming around near your feet so u never felt clean the water would take a good 2 hours to go through! It was the same for the sink not a good sight! Hot water was rare and when u complained the lady at the front desk would be like 'what do you expect look how many rooms we have!' How do u argue with that but when people had attempted the lady at the front desk will be extremely rude and act if she doesnt understand English. There was a man who worked in carter he was helpful in recommending things to do. Well Carter wasnt all bad what you paid for is what you got however I dont understand how people can be so rude and keeping the hotel clean will benefit them in not having nasty review!!!!!!!,Saintlysinner
UR1834701,2004-24-April,Ugh! This hotel is absolutely HORRIBLE! After we checked in we actually went around to nearby hotels to see what kind of availability & rates they had. But b/c we arrived in NYC on Good Friday everything was booked/expensive (ie. $150-$250/nt). So we decided to tough it out at this DUMP of a hotel. We paid for 8nts at $80/nt before taxes. And during this time our room was 'cleaned' ONCE (by 'clean' i mean they made our bed picked up our old towels and emptied the garbage. So that means no new sheets no vacuuming of the carpet or sweep of the bathroom etc). All the other nights we went down to the lobby to get our own towels & toilet paper b/c they 'forgot' to clean our room. Not only that they don't believe in vacuuming so the nasty carpet from the lobby to the corners of our room was covered with dirt & filth from the many guests before us. And the bathroom sink and floor was covered with hair from the previous guests - it was disgusting. When we turned on the A/C in our room to air out the cigarette stench clouds of dirt came out. The bathroom door didn't shut nor did the taps turn off completely. The first few nights there was no hot water in the evenings and there were huge line ups to use one of the 3 elevators (i'm talking like a 10-15min wait). The staff is RUDE RUDE RUDE - no concept of smiling or customer service they more or less just glared at you as you walked by. On the plus side this hotel is in a PRIME location in the heart of Times Sq and within walking distance to most sites. And we did have our own bathroom. But you know what we met a couple while in line for Letterman tickets and they told us they booked via Priceline and they paid $90/nt for a 4star hotel in midtown (the Sheraton). So i'd recommend for anyone wanting to enjoy their vacation and stay in a hotel to splurge a bit and find other accomodations - save yourself the heartache of paying for this DUMP. But if you do decide to stay at the Hotel Carter be warned we read the reviews here and knew it would be a lowly place but the reality was much much worse. And there is no word of a lie here i wouldn't waste my time writing this if i didn't want to share our experience. Peace out.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2112353,2004-23-May,We agree with all the bad reviews! We laughed just reading them as many of them described our same experience - we too were to stay at the Habitat and due to 'water problems' we were routed over to the Carter instead. Bare lightbulb on the ceiling 'death graffiti' on the wall of our room window wouldn't close so my daughter and I huddled together for warmth in mid March. Could hear the neighbors next door as they walked in and viewed their room for the first time - similar reaction of dismay! Bathroom door had no doorknob and thus not too much privacy. We skipped the shower as we were only staying one night - we didn't want to stand in the bathtub with bare feet. No washcloths. Dollar store shower curtain. But on the good side the difference in price for the Carter hotel compared to the Habitat DID pay for a nice dinner and as everyone else said the location is good. Very glad after reading other reviews that we did not try the elevator though we had to be pretty insistent for them to unlock the stair well! They had it locked from the outside for 'security' though you could get out if you went in. Also no smoke detectors and no sprinklers - that bothered me! So stay somewhere else if possible!,PJfan
UR2589774,2004-21-September,Hmm the scene was set; we're stuck for a place to stay in New York the day before we're due to fly. We have limited though not sparse resources and we try to find somewhere at least habitable for the first two nights. Whoa what's this? The Hotel Carter. Budget well-placed with private bathroom. Surely on this premise alone value for money would be a safe bet? Nope. From marching into the nu-porn neon glow of the lobby we were on the backfoot. The carpets didn't look as though they'd seen a vacum cleaner in years the continual drip-drip through the ceiling led us to believe the building was ready to fall into itself and the amount of disgruntled punters bemoaning the state of the place on the sidewalk really didn't set us up all that well. And this is before we reached the room. Again the room was notable by it's distinct uncleanliness torn wallpaper six-year old grafitti and ready-to-blow TV set. There was the most wretched stench emanating from the erm wardrobe and dead flies littered the already-rotting furniture. This was by far and away the worst hotel I have ever had the misfortune to inhabit. An absolute hovel of a place the place needs to be ripped asunder and built from scratch. Oh on the plus side we got away without paying for a multitude of phone calls and the shower was great.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2770463,2004-21-October,The hotel is very old and I had an impression they never changed anything in this hotel since it was build. I wont comment on the staff I had a little opportunity to deal with them. The building smells really bad looks (and is) dirty. The room we stayed in also smelled of a mold which was on the ceiling disguised by a thick layer of pain and in the bathroom the walls were even wet from leaking piping. Cleaning service: zero. Weve never seen a maid to change towels or take out a trash bin. Some positive things: it is right next Times Square everything is near. The cost of the rooms is cheap. Plenty of hot water in tub. We stayed only for three nights (we were out of the room as much as possible) so we could survive it. But we will never come back.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2837899,2004-21-November,Me and a travelling buddy did NewYork on the cheap big time in November of this year. Much to my personal distress of reading the reviews on this website i was really worried about staying here. If your the type of person (like myself) who is just happy to be in New York this hotel is a bargain. The bed was clean the shower was hot and the room was warm. If you don't mind the lobby/amusement arcade with flasing neons and mismatch furniture then you will be ok at the Hotel Carter. It was actually quite a laugh taking the p*@# out off the oldest security guard in New York and the location was excellent. Anyway how much time are you going to spend in your hotel room in the greatest city on earth?,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2769272,2004-20-October,We booked our 5 night stay at the Carter Hotel on the internet when we called to confirm we could not understand a word what the woman on the phone was saying and we suspected that the same could be said for her. After travelling for 12 hours we arrived exhausted. The man behind the protective glass was less than friendly to say the least. After several minutes of searching for our reservation (there was no computer our reservation was on a piece of paper pinned to the wall) he announced in broken english that he had a room for us but no key...so he would let us in. The light didn't work in the room so he let us into another (apparently he could not find the key for that one either!) The room was small and somewhat dirty and in need of much repair. Having said that the sheets appeared to be clean but we took no chance and used the bedding that we brought along. The lobby of the hotel smelled rank and the service was the worst I had ever seen. The TV didn't work well and the lock on the door was a challenge to open every time (we finally got a key at the end of the 2nd day) but we were able to overlook the shortcomings as the location and price were perfect. Apon checkout the man refused to return our cash key deposit when we returned the key as we had not kept the receipt...yes the same key that we waited 2 days for.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2900655,2004-20-December,This I can honestly say no exaggeration was the WORST hotel I have ever seen in my life. An absolute --------. I read the previous reviews a day before me and my mum were due to leave and hoped it couldnt be as bad as everyone was saying but believe me it really is worse than the reviews you read. On our arrival we were greeted with a queue of people waiting to check out after 5 minutes of being there. Not the best 1st impression!! I cant say I was surprised though. The whole hotel stinks of oil and grease as there is a burger bar or something built into the side of the hotel. The carpet has never seen the invention called a Hoover seriously its thick dirt and dust everywhere. The staff are like little Hitlers unbelievably rude. They dont empty the sanitary bins in your room before you arrive and the bed was disgusting. I could go on. You think your going to wake up after having a bad dream. Im only 19 and have stayed in two star hotels on holidays with friends you dont expect luxury but you expect it to be clean at least. We were lucky enough to find some place else so we didnt have to stay in this hellhole but you might not be so lucky so please dont go there!!! This place should be closed down and I would recommend every travel agent to take this hotel off your books like ours did. STAY AWAY.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2081236,2004-19-May,Stayed back in 1996. Our room was infested with cockroaches i killed twenty two on the first and the last night. My advice is simple aviod this place at all costs.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2460087,2004-18-August,Well where do I start? I was very nervous about Carter before we went to NYC especially after the reviews i had already read. They say its location location location when looking for a hotel and the location was excellent. It was straight out the door and into Times Square. We were on the fourteenth floor and had a corner room which was quite spacious although very basic and the carpet looked as though it had never seen a hoover since the day it was put down. We had good air con hot water (except the first morning when we were told they had experienced boiler trouble) and a working TV although the sheets were realtively clean i would reccommend sleeping bag liners and ear plugs (they were a life saver!). Unfotunately on the 7th day of our 9 day stay we found that we were not the only two in the room when our little guest had eaten through our gifts! The staff however moved us quickly and eventually refunded some money. With regards to the staff all except the lady at the desk (who can only be described as down right rude!) were poliet and helpful. Would never stay at the carter again unless it was totally refurbished but it was a CHEAP experience!,A TripAdvisor Member
UR1729138,2004-17-March,My friends and I have staid in all kind of hotels in the world (guesthouses but also four/five star hotels). We choose hotel Carter because all other hotels were full or too expensive (we paid $36 p.p. including tax). Because we read the reviews we tought the worst!! At the end we staid 5 nights at the Carter so it wasn't that bad: We could choose between two rooms and we choose a small room with two BIG beds and a great shower (better than in my home in Amsterdam!). The floor under the bed wasn't clean the window was broke and the room looks oldfashioned. Also our view wasn't like the internet told us to be but we were only in the hotel for a sleep and shower so that was o.k.. Tip: When you want to see a great view of TQ have a drink in the Marriot Hotel. The last night the man in the lobby took us to the rove for a view and showed us the better rooms (we didn't knew there were better rooms so when your room isn't o.k. ask for another one). The location is perfect and we had a really great time in NY. Good Luck and have fun!! Natascha,NataschaR
UR1650790,2004-16-February,I live in New York City. So I know what to expect. BUT this so-called "hotel" was just... horrible. I had to stay in a hotel until my house was fixed. I didn't want to spend that much money and I wanted to stay near my office. It was the biggest mistake of my life. I don't even understand why people call this a "hotel". I have stayed at other cheap hotels and I was never so furious. As I walked in the smell from the deli inside the hotel greeted me. The receptionist woman was rude. There was only one key for each room. Yes a "KEY" not the passcard you get in other hotels. And you have to deposit $1 for the key. I would never ever want to steal that key... There was even a homeless guy sitting at the chair in front of elevator and staring at my legs. Elevator door closed after I pressed "door close" button for the hundredth time. Once I got to 15th floor room doors made me think that I'm walking to my cell in prison. Ok now... the "room" I got. I got the mini-suite room since it was the same price as the regular double room and it has to be more spacious. Once I entered the room I saw dirty purple carpet with children's drawing-like patterns. It looked like it was vacuumed a year ago. And the room had "matching" purple curtain with cigarette burns. Alright the "hotel" people have a different or rather a bad taste. But the room didn't have to smell like cigarette. Yes I requested a smoking room but I didn't request any room filled with cigarette smell. I walked in to the bathroom. The door didn't close. Water was licking from the pipe. There was no hot water. And yes I almost forgot. As I was turning on the water the handle fell and I almost broke my toe. I kind of regret that I missed my toe. If it broke my toe I could have sued the "hotel". Damn! I turned on the TV and found out that not only they don't provice cable but only channel 7 was watchable. Other channels were just statics with little bit of sound. Even those cheap crappy motels have HBO. Don't ever stay there. If you are a budget traveler spend a little more time searching the yellowpage and get other cheap but not horrible hotel in the city. Remember NO hot water doors don't close rude receptionist smelly dirty room with purple carpet and curtain (I wouldn't want to know what colors other rooms were decorated). EVEN 80 BUCKS A NIGHT IS NOT WORTH IT!!!,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2885315,2004-16-December,We stayed at this hotel as there did not appear to be any other hotel available in NY in December. I failed to check this website until after we had booked and paid for this dump! From the minute we walked in we knew that it was a mistake there was a kebab shop downstairs but the entrance to the kebab shop was the same entrance as the one for the hotel the reception area stunk! it was absolutely MINGING! There was these crazy mats everywhere it looked like the owner of the hotel had sat and personally sewed all old mats together and made the flooring! and the mats were everywhere from the Reception floor to the walls and even the walls in the restrooms were decorated with these mats! The room was another story! I just wish I could attach a picture on here to show you! the carpet had not been hoovered since it was laid the bed was grose! the spread was holey and worn a disgrace! and that is not all i can sayeven the so called headboard was carpet! and the heating in the middle of December was off! can you beleive it! My boyfriend is now suffering with Flu and it was all because of the lack of warmth in the room we were well wrapped up when we went outside! and dont bother complaining the staff will all of a sudden not speak english! Good luck if you have already booked! you will be needing it!-it is safe to say that the place is a hole!,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2452743,2004-16-August,When I decided I would go to NY I knew I wanted a cheap hotel with a private bath. The Carter Hotel looked like a great hotel. Before I went to NY I started to chearch for all kinds of things which we could do overthere. I also searched for the hotel. I really wished I hadn't done this. I read all the terrible reviews on this page and I became very anxious. I really hate bugs and I like things to be clean. The hotel isn't clean there were sigar butts in our room and a couple of nails. The bathroom wasn't clean either. And they have only cleaned up once while we were there for 8 days. Luckily we haven't seen any roaches or other buggs. Only a couple of members of the staff speak English well the other ones can't understand you. We also haven't been stuck in an elevator like other people have written. The hotel is terrible but not so terrible that you can't stay there after you have already booked the hotel. ALthough I recommend you not to book it but if you did try to make the best of it. And look at it on the bright side: you only have to sleep there.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2575352,2004-15-September,After reading some of the reviews here before we headed to NYC we came to the conclusion that this hotel wouldn't be one of the best but would be grand if all you need is a bed. Thats fine but what you don't need is the hassle that goes along with staying in that bed! We arrived got to our room and everything seemed ok. The door was a bit stiff the bathroom door didn't close but all in all the room seemed ok. Later that night when we got back to the room the door wouldn't open. After 15 minutes of trying to get it open I had to go down and get someone. He came back tried to open it like I already had been doing then decided to get the master key. That didn't work either. So he got another key and that didn't work. When he went down to get yet another key I continued to try and open the dorr and eventually it opened. We had already decided to move to another room by this stage. The same guy bought us to another room. This room hadn't been cleaned. So off to another room. When he opened the door and turned on the light even he was disgusted by it. Bad smell not cleaned rats. Eventually we got another room that wasn't too bad. Unfortunately we'd booked 5 nights because availability wasn't great. Overall I'd stay well clear of this place.,boogs1
UR2299382,2004-15-July,You get what you pay for. Do not... I repeat... do Not... ever look under the bed. But again.... you get what you pay for!!! Get out of the room as soon as you wake up (07:00) and get back when you really have to sleep (1:00 am)... there will be no problem. The hotel has a good elevator system a lot of coke and water machines in the lobby and if you are lucky you can even call home. Look at the bright side: you are midtown no need to take a taxi to do anything. Perfect for the budget concious traveller.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2883039,2004-15-December,Ok firstly my husband and I have travelled a lot and apart from the occasion awesome Internet deal we stay in moderate to cheap style hotels. We are not use to 5 star or luxury when we travel and do NOT sit in our hotel (quite the opposite - usually in bed late and up early and out of the hotel) and yet we still think the Carter Hotel is the absolute worse hotel we have ever every stayed at!!!!!!! We have stayed at this hotel twice and to this day I can not believe that we went back for a second time. Yes it is cheap (for New York) and we were prepared the second time but this hotel is incredible!! On our first trip I did not take my socks off the whole time I stay here (5 nights) as I was afraid to touch the carpet I also opted to sleep in long pants and t'shirts rather than my normal pyjamas of fear of laying on the sheets. We witnessed cockroaches and mice and there was a blow up doll outside our window! Planning our second trip we searched long and hard for a hotel deal/special but with no luck decided to book the Carter for our first 2 nights so that we at least had something booked when we arrived (we ended up staying at the Carter for a total of 6 nights). I told my husband I wasn't staying there unless we were prepared... So once in New York we purchased sheets/pillow slips mat for the bath (to stand on) and disinfectant spray (which we sprayed EVERYWHERE!!!) Although we used all these things nothing can suppress the bad manners and bad service of the hotel staff. I can not agree more with all the other terrible reviews on this WebPage and can not reinforce how horrible this hotel is. We even got woken up on our last night (at about 1am) by banging on our day being accused of not paying for our stay. Mind you this hotel doesn't have a computer system and the fact that the Asian reception lady was on the phone when we check in it didn't surprise me that our proof of payment had been lost by the clerk. After telling the banging person we had our copy of the receipt he went away but returned again at 6am and demanded that we vacant the room!! My husband proceed downstairs to the lobby (with our copy of the receipt) and put the matter straight with the manager. After that my husband continued to proclaimed to the crowd in the foyer (a large crowd of tourists checking in or out??) that the hotel was run by MONKEYS!!!! Other negative factors about this hotel - main door to room didn't open you literally had to ram the door! - protesting Asians live in the lobby - the cafeteria in the bottom of the hotel stinks - there is bad taste carpet on the WALLS in the corridors - the lifts are slow and sometimes Don't work at all - furniture is from the dark ages Good points - cheap (but definately NOT WORTH IT) - At times square,A TripAdvisor Member
UR1785950,2004-15-April,I loved so much my stay in N.Y city this February that I decided to spend the Easter week-end there. I was going there with an "organised group" with a charter bus etc and the hotel hired was the Carter. I knew not to expect the same quality as the very charming and spotless B&B I had stayed in Feb but....this was nearly a NIGHTMARE!! Luckily I didn't get to meet any roaches but..... Right in the lobby you feel this is "not a hotel". Decadent dirty smelly no customer service concept at all. Total chaos there always full of people that seem not knowing where to go. You have to wait an eternity to get in the elevator. The carpet in the hallway is dirty not vacuumed with white stains. The room is smelly (dirty) I highly doubt the sheets were changed. The comforter had cigarette burns. The room was freezing but as soon as we put the heater on white things started coming out in the air so we shut it down. There were already white things on the floor between the bed and the heater. We contacted the reception which didn't do anything about it. The closet was not inviting with plaster from the wall fallen everywhere. The bathroom hadn't been cleaned before our arrival. The garbage can was still full from the last guests and there were lots of little black hairs(beard?) around the faucet. The shower was filthy. We lacked hot water almost for a whole day. Worst was the toilet that got "major problems" with s*** almost flowing out. We just shut the tap and used our neighbors's bathroom (our friends were there). On the day of our departure there was no check-out time(weird for that big a hotel downtown N.Y.) So we left the room at 3:45pm. No idea if the room was gonna be cleaned then for the next guests.... A positive thing about the Carter? at least I didn't see roaches (and hope I didn't "bring" some home in my luggage).,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2059877,2004-14-May,This place is a mess. we stayed here in 2001 for new years and the rooms were freezing because the a/c was still in the window when they changed our room we found a dead mouse on the floor. not having enoug money to go anywhere else my 2 daughters and i stayed but spent very little time in the room and we did not shower we washed off in the sink with towels we went and bought. this place should be shut down,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2876553,2004-12-December,If there is a review button with a negative sign as a rating option I would choose it. Even the 1 bullet "Terrible" rating is giving the hotel more credit than it deserves. My American friend and I survived our 4-night stay. We will go to heaven for being tolerant to the challenges posed by this hotel and did not suffer our friendship during our stay. Well we aced it all probably because: a) of my humble background in my upbringing in Asia - as an Asian I was taught to embrace the vicissitudes of life with humility and gratitude; b) we were seasoned travellers to NYC (you cannot deny the charm of this bright-light big-city juicy Apple); and c) we were so drained after a 20 hour flight from Asia to NYC that having a roof over our head and being away from the rain and cold in NYC in Dec were decent and welcoming!! BUT - surviving it all and being accepting do not mean allowing others to suffer unnecessarily the same horror which pales the Hammer House of Horror series. So do yourself a favour to get a better insight into the mismanagement of this hotel BEFORE you commit to part with your hard-earn money and risk ruining your deserving holiday in NYC. I read the reviews here with fond memories of our stay and agree to almost all of the minimal good and endless bad reviews. WHAT IS ATTRACTIVE ABOUT THIS HOTEL? The good side is that the hotel is in GREAT LOCATION right in the smack of Times Square and theatre district. This helps in saving a lot of time walking and rushing from point to point - particularly from dinner / shopping to your theatre show. You can always hop back to the hotel to rest before you embark on the 'second' part of your sight-seeing of the wonderful city if you choose a hotel in great location e.g. next to a metro station. This is probably THE ONLY REASON that the hotel survives the very very very bad reviews still stands there today. I am surprised that there are no law suits against them yet. Now what you are going to read are stuff which DATELINE 20/20 60 MINUTES and similar current affairs shows on your National TV should take up as a story - better still - with hidden cameras! a) BOOKING ON THE INTERNET The hotel website is pretty simple and decent enough to complete your booking transaction. Indeed - the Keep It Simple Stupid (KISS model) works like a charm on the website. Teachers - use it as an exemplar when teaching your students Information-Computer-Technology (ICT). But the RATES DO CHANGE AT THE LAST MINUTE - so print out COPIES of your booking confirmation to settle any dispute. I am forwarding a copy of the confirmation e-mail to my credit card issuing bank to dispute paying the difference. b) RECEPTION Do not expect customer service. Be nice to the staff and they reciprocate. I gave the booking confirmation to the Asian lady at the reception to process my booking. She did not return them saying that she needs them for records. I suspected that the reason she held on to them was to con me of the sudden higher revision of the room rates when she saw me reading the rates table on the counter - which - was then immediately removed by her 'floor manager' Henry - a senior Asian who seemed resigned to the state of affairs working (and owning?) the hotel. She was also on the phone when processing my booking. I could be arrested if I repeat what she hollared to the caller verbatim here. I had to WAIT to pay for our 4-night stay in full by credit card (cos the machine was not ready) as well as to get a key to the higher floors (cos the computer was not ready). We compromised for a lower floor room in the end - and wasted an hour waiting to get to the room after we arrived promptly via shuttle from JFK airport. c) MAYHEM AT THE RECEPTION You will be entertained by near Jerry Springer-like mayhem and shanigens in the exchanges between the guests and the hotel staff every now and then. We witnessed such situations when we checked in during late afternoon and checked out at 6 a.m. d) DECOR The talent of Martha Stewart will REALLY be put to test to deploy her to do community work for making over this hotel - if she has the life time and talent to do it. The pieces of carpets at the reception level were criminally mismatched that your eyes hurt - probably used as a strategy to de-range you so that you will lose out to any possible arguments with them. e) ROOM I do not know about the higher floors. It may help if you get them and have a decent view of the city. Our room had curtains that could not be drawn. The heater worked on the first night when we checked in - in fact - overworked that it was so hot that we perspired. Luckily there were a couple of unsealed areas around the air con unit (which was new) which we manipulated to allow fresh cold air to circulate into the room. Can't tell if the air-con unit was a toy. With the holes around in the room I suspect that there could be occupants other than ourselves i.e. rodents (as claimed by other reviewers) although I did not witness any. I took sleep aids for 2 nights to escape from the horror of reality into slumberland. On the first night we were too exhausted to care. f) TELEPHONE There is a 50 cent charge for local calls. I used my cell phone to pay for any extra charges my home phone company was going to charge as I was NOT going to put that ear piece of the telephone to my ear. My friend from Maryland claimed he called and left messages - which was not indicated by the phone red light. Never heard the phone rang throughout the entire stay there. g) TV You could not even re-sell that antic for free on ebay. Possibly going to be rejected by charity organisations. There were only 2 viewable channels. The rest were fuzzy images. The pin socket was losely connected to the power point and easily kicked off. We did not watch any TV but turned it on to muffle the air of desolation in the room. h) ROOM KEY DOOR & LOCK You will better appreciate the functions of keys door locks and door knobs more than ever in your life. My flexible asian hands renown for fixing anything could not even open and lock the door with the key. My friend did it with care and succeed each time we enter or leave the room. ONCE THE DOOR KNOB CAME OFF and we had to fix it back. Now I appreciate studying woodwork and metalwork in high school. i) BATHROOM & SHOWER Decent shower curtain. There were 4 taps: 2 for the bath tub and 2 for the shower. We let the water run a while before we shower just in case there was rust. The cold water shower tap did not work on the first night - but thank god it did subsequently. We showered only in scathing hot water. Finally - you could never completely shut the tap off after that ... drip drip drip every moment after that. j) TOWELS We had to go to reception to ask for new towels every morning (in a nice polite way) before we left for sight-seeing in the city - and the nice caucasian lady I spoke to behind the counter indeed arranged to have our bed made up as well which was a bonus to us! God bless her for her good work ethics and earning decent wages in a place like this. k) BED There were yellow stains on the bedsheet - but I convinced my friend that they were iron burnt marks so that he could have restful sleep. There was an extra pillow and blanket in the closet - but we dared not move them. We just hung our jackets in the closet - always fearing that something would jump out of it. We peeled the bed covers off the bed immediately when we got into the room - the carpets looked cleaner. We were amazed that there were no blood stains. l) FLOOR CARPET We were thankful to ourselves for bringing our own flipflops or sandals. We fear having our feet touched the carpet on the floor in the room or tiles in the bathroom. m) CABINETS I was living out of my luggage - but my friend had his clothes in one of the drawers as there was only so much room to place our luggage and things. We found out that the drawer of the pedestal next to the bed which the phone rested on could not be opened when we were looking for a directory. We finally did open it - but did not find any directory. There were left over items from previous generations of guests. OVERALL EXPERIENCE: We could not fault ourselves for choosing the hotel given that it was peak holiday season and we could not get rooms in the better hotels at affordable rates. We have explored checking our previous hotels at higher rates but there were no rooms available. RECOMMENDATIONS: If you have been in the military or working/living in some countries under immensely harsh living conditions you would probably survive the ordeal and take it with a laugh - even though I perceive that at US $89 per night excl. tax is over-priced for the dilapidated conditions. Like some reviewers who generously gave the hotel an OK rating it would probably be acceptable if you just need a bed and a roof for the day. But if you do not wish to suffer from disonance after shopping in MACYS BLOOMINGDALES and designer shops at Madison Ave with all the designer chic goods returning to a slump for accommodation then I suggest you consider paying the higher price to experience the pleasure convenience and prestige of other decent hotels. Otherwise you may need therapy after your holiday. We saw many guests got more than what the hotel claims "Our Room Rates Will Warm You Up" - the guests certainly got HOTTER in moods than just being warmed up from a ruined holiday living under sordid conditions. Someone reviewed Howard Johnsons as Hostel Johnsons and I guess now CARTER HOTEL would join the same league as Carter Hostel fighting very hard NOT to beat HJ to the title. To sum up the name of the hotel probably hinted to and did warn us all --- CARTER = Completely Atrocious Rooms That Encourage everyone to Run-away (FAST!).,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2818420,2004-10-November,I cannot believe anyone could stay more than 5 min in this hotel for that is all that I gave them. The rooms were totally disgusting PERIOD!!!!!!! The window was broken the bathroom looked like S---! There were more people in the lobby checking out that had just got there than I have ever seen in my life. One lady was complaining rats was all in her room yet she like so many others who ended up staying there were stuck because they were all from different countries and they had booked through a travel agent that had already charged them for the total stay. I felt really ashamed being American thinking if this is their first trip to America what a terrible impression based on that hotel. This hotel really needs to be shut down!!!!!!! I was one of the lucky ones because I booked on my own I was given a full refund and found a better hotel. I stayed at the Ramada Inn Eastside which was very very nice and it was not that much more. To all TRAVEL AGENTS PLEASE DO NOT BOOK THIS HOTEL FOR ANYONE!!! I would have preferred living in the Subway Station than that hotel room.,IM2QT4U
UR2176844,2004-10-June,If you are reading this after you have booked to stay then I am sorry we booked to stay at the Carter Hotel in New York City before reading the reviews something we regret. The hotel is run by all chinese people there english is not very good and they are particularly abrupt when they do manage to speak to you in english. The hotel reception area smells like a chinese takeaway given to the fact that they have some sort of food takeway at the front of the hotel below the lobby. The hotel decor is old fashioned and tacky and the rooms are dirty and old fashioned as well  whilst I can say our bed linen was white the matresses were very stained and dirty. The TV was old and just about worked allbeit a few channels the bathroom was old and dirty. There were no light bulbs or light shades in the hotel room and but if you happen to have a room on the front of the hotel then the sign is bright red at night giving you ample light in your room allbeit 'red'. We did however have a brilliant time however we only stayed the one night!,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2799206,2004-1-November,I read all the advice on this website before I left on my trip but decided it could not be that bad! I have been a backpacker in Asia Australia and Europe after all and I have stayed in some dodgy hostels but the Carter Hotel is a first!! We arrived on a Friday evening into the lobby which looks like it has not seen a vacum cleaner since it was built. I join the line for the check in and in the 15 mins I waited I hear 6 people complain that their rooms haven't been cleaned in 4 days and 2 complain that their keys don't work I still am convinced my mini suite with a view of time square will be ok... eventually my turn arrives the Asian women at the desk is rude and impatience with me when I show her my booking she also insists I pay before I see my room so i agree ... she hands me the key and mumbles that it is not what I had booked and 'if i not happy to return to desk' So after a few giggles with fellow guests in the lobby we decided to take the trip to the 10th floor .... Oh dear I have never seen anything like it the carpet was worn and unvacumed there was no wardrobes or storage space and the bed linen was smelly and my view of Times Square was a black wall the TV looked like it was bought in a garage sale in 1970 .... So we turned our heels and went back down to the front desk I joined the line again and once again listened to one person after another try to get some answers or help or anything from the receptionists (inlcuding a cleaner begging for the right wages!) When it was my turn I politely said that I had seen my room and it was not what I ordered and may I have another room She rudely put out her hand for the keys and said 'one minute please' and arrived back with all my cash and said good bye!! Me and my friend standing there speechless ... A rainy Friday evening in New York believe me it is not easy to get a hotel room .... my advise to you book a hotel before you go and under no circumstances this one However when you are visiting Time Square but 30 mins aside to stand in the lobby of this hotel it is an experience one I will never forget and I didn't even stay!!!,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2350200,2004-1-August,The Carter was the final stop on a 2 month tour of the states I recently made with 2 fellow students. After becoming accustomed to grotty run down hostels we had very low expectations..... which was a good job as the Carter certainly fitted into this bracket! The room was marginally bigger than the two double beds it contained the TV flickered on every single channel the air-conditioning was non-existant (therefore we were entertained by a symphony of car horns all night) we had 1 towel between 4 the beds were made once (out of an 8 night stay)..... The list goes on!! Avoid if at all possible! (Unless you are also a poor student in which case beggars can't be choosers!),A TripAdvisor Member
UR1760623,2004-1-April,This hotel is just awful. Cheap hotels need not be this bad. Its dirty (the staff use a mop not a hoover to clean the carpets). The staff are incredibly rude. We were told the bathroom doors deliberately don't close in rooms so the person you share with can hear EVERYTHING when you are in the bathroom the rooms are so small. The hotel stinks of cooking fat and this wafts into the rooms through the windows that do not close. There are large stains on the carpets and furniture. People tried to get in the room this is not a safe hotel for women to stay in. Please shop around we found fantastic hotels for the same price just a couple of subway stops away.,Oreizack
