UR123998148,2012-2-February,Sorry not even reasonable for the price. Some homeless people in the region had more comfortable accomodations. July 4 weekend it was 109/night we were desperate because most places sold out. Window was busted up and didn't close fine for the temprature realy bad for the nose exhaust of cars out front and the constant fear of gun point robbery. The front desk staff and manager was AWFUL. Lied to us about rooms on phone watched him lie to potential customers coming in. Def. crack deals and hooker situations going on in one of the corner rooms. It was just so horrible. Don't do it.,Kfordell
UR124392872,2012-10-February,Don't do what I did....stay here with my family because it was the best price I could find. At 2am with other occupants of the hotel screaming drunk and in a terrible fight I would have paid the $50 more or $100 to NOT have been there. We got little sleep and had to call front desk to come and handle the people fighting right outside our door. I didn't really care that much that the room was run down and dirty. It was exposing my kids to what felt like a truly unsafe situation that caused my regret. This hotel is definitely the home to drug deals prostitution and all night hollering and brawls. I've never written a review before but I feel strongly about trying to help you avoid what we went through. When we checked in there was a very unhappy looking couple checking out. Had I known then what I know now I would have never checked in. Just suck it up and stay at the Paramount. You'll be glad you did.,Teri T
UR107512417,2011-9-May,I never cease to be amazed at hotels that look so nice on-line but in reality are quite the opposite. This place was so awful it was comedic. How about cigarette butts on the hallway carpets? How about transvestites asking you for a corkscrew at 8:00 am? How about a general "lock up' at night? Do you like broken 1950s plumbing? Do you like 1960s polyester spreads drapes carpeting and uphostery? This place should have been torn down with the majority of the Seattle Worlds Fair buildings in 1962.,Pandabear202
UR99424591,2011-8-March,Unbelievable! This is a great place to stay if your into drug trafficing prostitution and hanging out with people who are high on who knows what!!!??? My girlfriends and I came to stay for the weekend and were mislead by the online ad for this Motel (which was advertised as a Hotel). As soon as we pulled in people on the lower levels shut out their lights and started peaking through the cracks of their curtains... Too high to realize that we could see them! We unloaded our things onto an elevator and were surrounded by about 5 men covered in pock and track marks! We witness two GI's (who happened to check in when we did) go to their rooms with two (i'm not kidding!) noticible transvestite prostitutes. We finally made it up to our room and realized that the door didn't lock! The front desk gave us a hard time about switching up to a room that did lock. We were on the 3rd level and as we looked down into the parking lot people were wondering from room to room. One room in particular had people roaming in and out while friends waited in the parking lot. We had people knock on our room door asking us if we had a cigarette matches a lighter? We decited to leave to go get a drink (we had to be atleast a little tipsy to fall asleep in this hell hole!!!) We went to pull out and realized we were totally locked in! Not a security gate where we could use our room key to enter or exit... But seriously... a full on gate that was padlocked shut. The manager had to come out and unlock open and lock it back up. We asked why we were locked in like that and they said to protect us from the people out there! We couldn't help but ask... What about the people in here????!!!!! This is the 1000% truth about our experience at this hotel. We only stayed one night and I am surprised we survived!!! (ha ha ha... we did hear one gang member looking guy mention that we looked like cops... We went with that!) The only good thing about this hotel was the free parking!!!!,CrisConn
UR120240874,2011-6-November,ARG! How this overall ranked as 3 stars is completely beyond me. As I was checking in rats were climbing all over the counter squeaking for a refund. Ok no real rats. Nor bugs that I noticed but for the love of Seattle this place was a DUMP. Where to begin the street level parking is awful. The underground was horrible as well. The room was the size of 3 closets put together. The one elevator with buttons from 1912 was scary. The staff was incredibly unhelpful. There was no breakfast. The bathroomoh GOD the bathroom was small old disgusting dirty and full of hair and rust - no joke! There was no Kleenex in the place. The bed was hard and scary. Thank goodness there were three locks on the doors because the place didnt seem secure. Now its in a great neighborhood and the views were very good of both downtown and the space needle. Its on the Monorail but be prepared to walk  mile one way or another to board it. It has a reasonable price. Butwhat I had to experience there was not worth $10. The ONE-WAY ramp into the underground parking was so narrow Im surprised a scooter could make it. And even then youll have to back up move forward back up a few times to get into a spot. Again I liked the neighborhood and area and the price was okay but dear Lord I worried about all the contents of my car the entire stay I had there  I was moving to Seattle and had all my belongings in my vehicle. And equally I could NOT stand the disgusting bathroom or the free Wi-Fi that only worked one of my two nights there. The only reason I didnt move out after 1 night was because the price only matched hotels 20 miles away from downtown and thats where I needed to stay. Please PLEASE do not stay here. If you care about your belongings your sanity your security your cleanliness or your well being you will avoid this place like the plague it is.,Steve R
UR117710399,2011-5-September,The place is filthy I'd expect to find a cleaner bathroom in a crackhouse! The staff have no control over the guests and parties carried on on both levels of balconies until after 3am. Repeated complaints had no effect and no got any sleep. In the morning we told the desk clerk how unhappy we were and his answer was " Guess you shouldn't have stayed here." I did but I'm urging everyone else to avoid this dump like the plague you'd be better off sleeping in your car!!!,Rigger513
UR115023537,2011-4-July,My brother friend and I decided to take an overnight trip to Seattle. WE checked into the hotel and upon arrival realized this was defiantly not what the website made it out to be. but we were only sleeping there so it was not a big deal. We had a great time in the city until we returned to the hotel to find all of our stuff had been stolen. We immediately called the police and notified the front desk. The hotel did not even give us a free night at the hotel. Nor do they seem to care that if we were in the room we could have potentially been hurt or maybe killed. When we spoke with the "manager" he could not even provide us with the owners name. This place is extremely sketchy. I Would not recommend anyone to stay here.,mlg86
UR115993301,2011-29-July,The room sucked parking sucked and the service sucked. Do not stay here. It wasn't even worth $79 per night. I'll pay more to stay somewhere else next time.,spoka29
UR114814783,2011-27-June,This hotel is horrible! we've got an old room unlike rooms in the hotel site's pictures. The room was old and cigarette stinking. The mattress was so old it was better sleeping on the floor. The room was right on the street (1st floor) plus a can vending machines was right outside our door. The walls and window were so thin we felt like lying in the middle of the street! Could not sleep at all and regret the moment we chose this hotel. We payed 140$ include taxes and it was way to much!,David_alon
UR118566910,2011-25-September,If I was bringing a hooker back to some seedy hotel this is where I would go. The rooms are about 12'x12' and the bed squeaks every time you move. No water glasses tin tiny soap bars and a broken smoke detector add to the ambience of this fine establishment. The bathroom is about the size of a closet. We found a smoked cigarette butt floating in the toilet in our non-smoking room. Shows exactly how much the owners care about cleanliness. I ended up paying for parking since the underground parking lot was full. This feat of manueverig only took 20 minutes of my time since the idiot at the front desk obviously did not keep track of anything. The tv in the room got all 4 basic cable channels so I guess thats a plus. Only stayed here because all other hotels were booked. How the owners get away with changing $100 is beyond me! The best part of staying here was getting out of the room. Avoid this dump at all costs unless you have some kinky hooker fantasy going on or want to experience how people in communist Europe used to live.,Johnnygman
UR115520443,2011-19-July,My boyfriend and I wandered in here late one night and managed to book a corner room on the 3rd floor for $60. The King's Inn is one of the only downtown hotels where I haven't been required to put a credit card on file. The pleasant fellow at the front desk did take a cash deposit for the old school metal room key he provided us. I asked about amenities and he mentioned a TV in each room. When I got to my windowless corner room I was appalled. The room was dingy dirty and below the standard of all but the most flexible of travelers. The bed made us cringe the door kept opening by itself and the portable space heater kept buzzing. The bathroom was very similar to the ones in an airplanes in size and the water pressure was awful. The linens were of the lowest imaginable thread count. It's really too bad the place could be really cool if the owners spent a bit of money on it. Originally the Town Centre Motel the hotel was considered the best located in the city in the 60s and features a cool mid century motor inn design. The location is pretty great... right under the monorail close to the downtown/ retail core Belltown and the Seattle Center. Unless you are stranded in downtown Seattle with no credit card I would not recommend staying here!,Lael_Lael
UR120710633,2011-17-November,For the price you can't expect too much. We only used it as a place to sleep. Only one light in the room worked and the lock was suspect. No wifi or breakfast but Top Pot Donuts is next door which is a plus. Service wasn't great but wasn't bad although they did make the beds after our first night. Good as a place to sleep and location but not much else.,petegas78
UR60840400,2010-9-April,My two sisters brother in law and I stayed at this motel as a last resort. We arrived in Seattle on a Saturday afternoon and to our dismay every single hotel in the downtown area was booked solid. We drove around for hours searching for somewhere to stay the night. At our last stop Best Western we were informed that there were no rooms available. The gentleman at the counter then suggested that we try the Kings Inn. It was already midnight by the time we arrived at the Kings Inn. I had my sister go and see if a room was available. She returned a couple of minutes later and told me that the Korean guy who ran the place had assured her that the rooms were very clean. She then made the colossal mistake of booking a room for the night The nightmare began when I was cautiously approaching the room. Several gangsters and prostitutes approached me and asked me if I wanted to go to a party in their room. They looked like they had been on a weeklong booze and drug binge! When I kindly told them no they began calling me obscene names and flipping me off! Terrified my family and I ran into the room and tried to close the door only to discover that it would not shut properly and had no lock on it! We then began to examine the room and our hearts sank in unison. It was an absolute pigsty! It reeked to high heaven and strange formations of mold appeared to be growing on the ceiling. The beds were shoddy and dirty. The mattresses were sunken in the middle and there were bloodstains on the sheets. They smelled like an outhouse! We were horrified! We decided as a group to get a refund and to try to find a hotel outside of Seattle. When we asked the Korean man for a refund he rudely told us that too much time had passed and he was not going to give us our money back. He told us that the best he could do was to give us a new room. We had spent the last of our money on the room and the car was too small to sleep in so we were forced to stay in that hell hole! When we arrived at the new room the only thing that had changed was that the door actually had a lock on it. When I inspected the bathroom I almost retched! The floor tub toilet and sink had suspicious brown stains all over them and the mirror was broken. Later that night when I took off my shoes I was disgusted when my feet began sticking to the carpet. The further I walked the stickier my feet became! When I sat down and looked at the bottom of my feet they were completely covered in a revolting black substance! I decided to sleep with all my clothes on that night. It was around 2 am when someone began screaming outside of our room and began pounding on our door! They sounded like they were being murdered! We could hear loud rap music blasting throughout the night and people partying until 5 am! We all spent a sleepless night too frozen in terror to sleep! The next morning I was itching furiously and had flea bites all over my arms! Needless to say this hotel is not fit for even animals to inhabit! It should be shut down as soon as possible!,wearytraveler3333
UR52739062,2010-6-January,We wanted to stay close to the city that is why we had chosen this hotel. The location was really good but the rest really was not. We are not so demanding guests but what we have experienced here was really a bad dream. The hotel seemed nice from outside but then everything relieved. Dirty bathroom no breakfast (only coffee and tea!) dirty room. What was the worst - we have realized next day in the morning- there was some flea in the bed so we had more than 40 stings all over our bodies! If you have to stay in Seattle please look for a better hotel!,CecilleTatras
UR46049252,2009-6-October,My daughter and her father as well as her grandmother and some friends stayed at the King's Inn for one night before departing on a cruise to Alaska. She told me that when they drove up to it she thought they were stopping to look at the map and then would be on their way to their actual hotel. She called me and told me that she was staying in "a hole" and at first I ddin't beleive her. But when she told me all of the things she was experiencing: sticky carpets slow wi-fi smelly beds loud traffic outside the window "creepy" men staring at her and her friends from the third story balcony outdated bathrooms and many other inconveniences I agreed that she was staying in a hole. I checked on trip advisor and read the horrid reviews that other people had written. They were staying another night in Seattle but she and many members of the group felt that it was unacceptable (and that's being nice about it) to stay here. The clerk at the desk the afternoon they arrived was very nice and did not give them any trouble. But the man in the morning was rude. One of the girls on the trip accidentally left a charger to her camera plugged into the wall and when they went back to the King's Inn to ask if anyone had seen it and brought it to the front desk the clerk (the one who was rude earlier that day) said that he didn't know anything about it and that the maids would have been the ones to have it. But he didn't have a key to the maid's closet and couldn't get ahold of them on the phone to ask. They went back at the appropriate time that the maids were supposed to be there but they found out that the clerk had told them wrong and that the maids came in the mornings. This place may have been cheap but she said that she did not feel safe (because sometimes the doors did not lock) and she would have paid some of her own money (that was meant for shopping on the cruise) to stay somewhere else. The rooms could have been dirtier I suppose but my daughter told me that the sheets were scratchy and stained and the comforter smelled like something very unpleasant. She was able to joke about how utterly disgusting it was and it was certainly something that she will never forget.,Houstondoglover
UR45706750,2009-3-October,We arrived from a long arduous overseas flight with our 12 month-old baby and checked into the Kings Inn at around 10pm. Juggling bags baby and a pram we made our way up the stairs. The rooms were small (no problem) and clean but perhaps a little TOO clean - the carpets were extremely sticky and smelt overpoweringly of chemicals. Asked for a spoon to feed bub - no we don't have any spoons. OK then. Continued struggling up and down the stairs over the next three days with a pram even had the help of the front-desk attendant one day. You can imagine my surprise when on the last day I noticed an elevator one of the corners of the hotel... Unhelpful staff yes but the location was great and the streets were nice and quiet. I'd only stay here again if I were absolutely desperate (and single). The price should have been some type of warning...,nixon_baby
UR25046027,2009-23-February,Where to even begin.....my wife and I checked in to a smoking room on a Sunday morning.....the morning front desk clerk was helpful and personable.....we get to the room and the tv didn't work no big deal i went to the front desk and asked for an ashtray and for someone to come and look at the tv.....he brought the ashtray and switchedc out the tv for us.....we proceeded to go to the aquarium and returned a few hours later to the room....we were only in the room a f ew minutes when the phone rang....I proceeded to attempt to answer but didn't hear anyone on the other end so I hung up.....Again phone rings I answer and didn't hear anyone.....I proceeded to walk down to the front desk to see if it was them trying to call......The afternoon clerk begain to verbally accost me about smoking in the room.....he continued on about how it was setting off the internal silent fire alarm.....I stated that we requested a smoking room and were given an ashtray by the morning clerk.....He stated that it was impossible because the hotel was a non-smoking one and called the other clerk at home to verify the information that I gave....Upon the verification I received no apology......I then asked to speak to a manager and was rudely told that one was not available to talk to .....I asked for my money back so that my wife and I could check-in to another hotel....he obviously thought I was a comedian since he laughed in my face and told me that I was not getting one.....he did however offer us another room (one he didn't care if we smoked in).....I reluctantly agreed and proceeded to gather my luggage to move into the new room......He gave me the key and said we should be set and never moved from behind the desk......Needless to say my wife and I moved all the luggage ourselves as well as the tv (since the tv in the new room didn't work and the clerk told me to go ahead and switch them out).....upon entry into the room much to our surprise their was an ashtray (LOL)....Not only that but there wer ashtrays in 75% of the rooms we passed on our way to the new room (LOL).....As we got settled in trying to avoid sticking to the nasty carpet we decided to order food....unfortunately I had to go to the front desk yet again because the phone in this room didn't work either.....The next morning waking up late for we didn't recieve the wake-up call until 2 hours after the rquested time....I proceeded to the front desk and tried to explain the situation from the previous night to the Monday morning clerkbut I was rudely told my story sounded very "one-sided"....I then asked again for a manager and again was laughed at like a comedian......and was told one was not available.....so with the speed of Superman We packed our bags checked-out of the god-forsaken place and headed to the nearest health clinic for a tetnus shot....... These rooms were completely disgusting.....The staff was rude crude and sociablly unexceptable......I would not recommend this hell to a gitmo bay prisoner..... It made the Walter Reed Medical Center look like the Ritz Carlton.....However if you are looking for drugs prostitution or down right ignorant hospitality this is the place for you......Thank you King's Inn for making my stay in Seattle a memorable one.....,jojobaggins69
UR42236664,2009-16-September,Because of a change in plans we were unable to stay our last night at Westen a couple blocks away. Also unable to get a room on short notice at any other hotel downtown. If we had a car we would have slept in it. Set a wake-up call with the clerk when we checked in and discovered when we got to the room there was no phone. He gave me a spare from under his counter but we didn't need it anyway because the wake-up never came and we never slept for more than an hour at a time anyway because of the noise and concern about an open window on the ground floor in the area the place was situated. Air conditioner didn't work--were told by clerk it worked like all the others and if we were not not satisified open the window. One bulb in three-bulb bath fixture. Stay away. Made the Bates Motel look like a five-star.,tr6mac
UR29137460,2009-1-May,With some investment this could be a pleasant property but the rooms are very basic.,moalta
UR21547202,2008-4-November,As a budget hotel I didn't expect much and it lived up to my expectations. It was two bedroom and they were clean but very old. Phone lines and cable lines coming from the vents because it still has the older style plastered walls. The location is great though and I was basically just sleeping there anyway. Single men is about the only group I would recommend this establishment to.,Titanicvol
UR15468242,2008-29-April,Easily the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. Only stayed there because Holiday Inn screwed up our reservation and this was the only place in the area that had a vacancy. Upon arrival the room nex door was being fumagated by guys in white coveralls and respirators spraying chemicals (probably to kill the cockroaches or to clean up after someone got snuffed the night before). It was noisy cold etc. Only stayed there 5 hours checked in returned at 3am and left at 8am. Couldn't get out fast enough. Larry Canada,lawnmowerman67
UR20455094,2008-28-September,There were several problems with this motel. let me first tell you about the pluses: it was very conveniently located. It is inexpensive for the location. Now the minuses: poor upkeep everything looked used dented broken smudged or dirty. The room was very small so small that one of ran into the table every time he got up in the night. And worst of all the carpeting was sticky. When I was getting ready to leave I looked at the soles of my feet they were black! Unless you have nowhere else to stay spend the extra 20-30 dollars and stay in a better place!,zapatista234
UR16224641,2008-20-May,Seattle PD where were you on the night of my stay? My vehicle broke down in the downtown area early January on my way back to Vancouver. The Kings seemed like a life saver at the time as it was 11:30 Pm on a wednesday night. The rate (about $90) although pricey was still cheaper then a tow truck. Upon checking in I was greeted by a very friendly gentleman of dark complexion who kindly showed me to my room and assisted me in finding a quality pizza service. It seemed that all would be well as I retired to my room to grab some some sleep. I believe I was afforded an hour of sleep before the Nightmare started. Sometime around 2:00 AM the screaming door slamming and other intense activities began. It wasnt untill I went outside for a cigarette that I realized how badly law enforcment was needed. I was first approached on the balcony by an african fellow who wondered if I had " that Creme" for him. This was only the first of many attempts to lure me into a room by many of the motels occupants. There was obvious drug use of the Crack Cocaine variety present as well as prostitution  violence and drug trafficing from room to room. I believe i had been mistaken as someone else because all night there were phone calls being routed to my room and people banging on my door asking if " I had It" for them. What happend to decency and safe clean nights sleep? I'll be sure to steer clear off the downtown area from now on. Seattle is so wonderful during the day but don't ever let yourself be caught there at night. Dont let the Kings Inn fool you it seems alright but unless you feel like gambling with your morality and your decency stay as far away as you can from this Dark Dirty Drug Den.,OldTimeGuy
UR18903257,2008-13-August,Only place on short notice! Big mistake! Showed up in the lobby paid for the room. Once we got up to the room it was a dump. I would let my dog sleep there. This place is the biggest dump that I have seen EVER! Went to a friends room at the Weston tried to find another room in the city couldn't was going to sleep on the floor in our friends room. Called Kings Inn tried to get our money back after half hour and wouldn't give a refund. Called AAA which recommend then place on a whim since everything else was sold out in town. They told AAA there we that we sleep in the bed and used the shower. We spend 3 minutes in the room and left didn't even take our things up too the room. Loser and a RIP OFF.,RosevilleGuy76
UR15906733,2008-11-May,You can tell this place use to be a crash hotel by the looks. They have fixed it up but it's still a dump; the sink and towel rack supported with 2x4's cigarette burnt marks on the furniture and blanket pervasive cigarette smell in the room veneer chipping and falling off the furnitureetc. The worst part is the down and out is still crashing at the place. Your neighbor could be the crazy who talks to himself or the John solicited by the hooker standing in front of the joint. Do not go to this place. For the same price you can go to the 6th Avenue Inn a block away.,berni88
UR10040702,2007-4-October,All the other hotels in downtown Seattle were booked except this hotel...there was a reason for this. We took the elevator up to our floor only to have the elevator door open and it was filled with dirty laundry and no hotel worker. Rooms were old dirty and not well kept. Also the door did not shut properly and there was a hole in the window. The walls were dirty and you could tell that the carpet was not laid properly as it was coming up all along the edges. Our bed sunk in the middle and the sheets had stains on them. I understand it is a budget hotel but this is beyond budget.,LeeSmith123
UR7258889,2007-31-March,its freezing cold and the heater is broken. there is a replacement heater that shorts out the power every 15 minutes asian guy behind the desk said and i quote "dont use the electric"!!! no clock  no heat no power. and im being blown off. there are no extra rooms. i feel like a hitman on a stake out. this is the very worse hotel ive ever been in. the pictures shown online must have been the only decent room. seriously these are not exxagerations. do not book this room! the health board needs to be called. suicideboards@yahoo.com,suicideboards
UR10079042,2007-14-October,I planned to stay here out of desparation as my original plans changed. I had no luck getting lodging nearby for the night and had a reservation here the following night. I decided to try this place. At 9:30 am I was told I could check in now if I liked. My baggage was at the hotel I had stayed the night before. I was charged up front for two nights before even going to the room! I headed back to where I stayed the night before and checked on one more place (a nice major chain) they had a room for only $30 more. I returned to this place and told my change of plans. I was told I would not get a refund for the night as I had already checked in and it had been more than 30 mins. My reasons were: very small room very outdated and worn furnishings overwhelming smell of cleaning solution and portable space heaters! They would not listen and insisted I had checked in (I guess according to there computers). The offered me another room. When I went to that one there was plaster chipping and falling off the wall at baseboard level. I decided it was not in my best interest to stay and they refunded the next night which was $20 chaeper than the current night. The time lapsed from my charge and credit was 37mins/40 secs. I most likely spent 7 mins or so trying to get a refund and checking out the other disgusting room. The condition of this place should warrant $50 rooms. There are numerous affordable (some even cheaper)rooms nearby but they were not available. I guess this would explain why there were so many "Ready" rooms at 9:30 on a Saturday morning. Never pay up front and price is not everything!,FlaTourist
UR5561951,2006-6-August,Save yourself a hassel and do not stay at this place. We asked if we could view a room before making a decision. The Asian man behind the counter told us we could but we needed to give him a credit card to hold while we did. We came back disqusted and said we were surely not going to stay there. The room smelled like cigarette smoke. The outdoor elevator didn't seem as though it had the power to make it to the third floor (probably because there were a few hundred cigarettes on the floor of the elveator). The paint on the walls of the room was coming off in more than a few places. Over the phone they told us that parking was free. When we arrived they told us it was 15 dollars a night to park at the hotel. They advertised the room as a suite. Really it had a bed tiny bathroom and a small beat up microwave was on the floor. When we arrived back at the counter to ask for our card back he told us he thought we intended on staying and he said he already ran the credit card for a full weeks stay. We were furious and demanded he reverse the charges. He told us it was too late and that our conversation was upsetting possilbe customers so he called the police. When the police arrived they were confused at why he was charging us. The asked him when it could be reversed and he said in the morning. The best thing he did all night was call the police on us because the police ended up being on our side completely. We still ended up being charged 5 percent of a weeks stay. ALL WE WANTED TO DO WAS LOOK INSIDE A ROOM BEFORE MAKING A DECISION. YOU WOULD BE BETTER OFF SLEEPING IN A DUMPSTER THAN PAYING TO DEAL WITH THE PLACE. I WISH I HAD READ THIS BEFORE GOING TO THIS PLACE. We ended up staying a couple blocks away at Summersfiled suites. I highly recommend Summerfields suites. They said that they get upset customers who just came from Kings Inn all the time and that they actually keep numbers on how many people complain about Kings Inn every week.,firefighter888
UR5231128,2006-29-May,This place is by far the worst place in the Seattle area unless yu want to sleep under the I-5 bridge. The rooms are totally run down and falling apart. The shaowers have ten year old caulk and are stained from neglect and smell like rotting animals from absence from cleaning. Unfortunatly this place was the last to choose from for us and we deeply regret having to stay here. The police were here several time dealing with the drugs and prostotution. The manager was totally stressed out as a slum lord is and because of his stressed state he makes it hard to get to your room because he is having to weed out the crime. This "KIng's Inn" is fit for a rat king that manages his roches. Please PLEASE do not stay here unless you want the worst place you want to be on earth. I felt like puking on myself just to fit into this rat infested hole that crack head and hookers live in.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR4372992,2006-23-January,My 3 sisters and I drove to Seattle from MN to see the Vikings vs. Seahawks in preseason (good luck at the Super Bowl.) Before we arrived my mom paid for our room. So after I got home and got my charge card bill I was shocked - Kings Inn charged me $205.76 for being a no show! They also overcharged my mom $40 from the agreed upon rate. It wouldn't have been a big deal if they would have fixed the error and apologized - Wrong!!! They did no such thing in fact they said these things happen and blamed us. I have spent many hours trying to remedy this with no luck. Yes the place was old but charming and we LOVED the location. But customer service NO WAY!,A TripAdvisor Member
UR5491160,2006-20-July,After making reservations I had to cancel due to change of trip plans. I called the property cancelled and they said that would be fine. One month later my credit card has a bill for onenight's stay. After calling them back and telling them of their error they refused to credit may card. Total refusal to cooperate even though it was their error. Steve in Charlottesville VA,steve-in-cville
UR3299262,2005-24-March,We were doing multi-city traveling so decided to make sleeping arrangements lowest priority. This definitely was low. Southwest Airlines recommended this motel and we made reservations for 3 nights. We drove in late from Vancouver (1:30 a.m.) and boy were we surprised. There is a sliding barrier gate that is locked after a certain hour to keep out non-guests. They needed it as two guys off the very noisy entrance street tried to get in "to visit a friend" when we checked in. When they were made to leave they were shouting discrimination because we were getting in. People were wandering around the hotel all night making lots of noise. The room was musty and needed renovation. Remote control missing from it's anchored spot on the nightstand. At 3 a.m. husband had had enough of the noise and wanted to leave but we stuck it out til daylight and checked out. Sleeping arrangements have made a huge leap in our priorities. We lost half a day of seeing Seattle by sleeping the next day out of exhaustion. Comfort quiet and security were only $40 more across the street.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3297289,2005-23-March,We picked up a coupon book from a rest stop and discovered that all the motels we tried had reason not take them including this one. So we paid a whopping $80.00 u.s. to stay in this god forsaken place. It smelled bad the T.V. barely worked the wallpaper was falling off the wall and patched elsewhere the mattress was old and sagging (very sore backs in the morning) the toilet wouldn't flush unless we played with the handle for a while and the in wall heater under the window was broken so we had a floor heater sitting on the floor in this already very tiny room. A few doors down from us was a group of young men who were there explicitly for partying. They were yelling running back and forth (by our room) thowing plastic ice buckets and hanging off the banisters on and off throughout the night. I did not sleep. Being from Victoria we started our trip at 4 a.m. so we were very tired and ended up here because we had tried so many places and just got tired of looking. We visit Seattle several times a year and have for tweny-five but we decided on that night that Seattle just isn't worth it anymore. I cringe to think what $80.00 u.s. would get me in Victoria.,47dingos
UR3551385,2005-14-June,I will never stay at this place again. The photo's in their listing are very misleading the room I was in doesn't even come near resembling the one in the picture. The Room in MAJOR need of updating. The matress was old and sagging EVERYWHERE the carpet was dirty the paint on the walls peeling. The bath tub was mildewy and rust stained the light fixture was wired in with the wire running up the wall across the cieling and over to the fixture. The light fixture was held together with Masking tape. The mirror in the bathroom was broken on the edges in several places leaving sharp edges easy to cut yourself on. The tv was plugged in using a long thin extension cord over to the other wall. They lock the gates at 11pm so you can't get your car out of the garage and you have to buzz to get onto the property to get to your room. Over all this is one of the WORST hotels I've ever stayed in.,A TripAdvisor Member
