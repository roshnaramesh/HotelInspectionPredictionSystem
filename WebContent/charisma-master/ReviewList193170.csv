UR125183035,2012-25-February,I love London. I really love London. This was my first time to reach my dream come true. I got the opportunity to go for short holidays in my ..well my life since I have professor's degree in English language and literature (second language). So visiting London it's life changing experience. But little I have known that this trip would be (almost) spoiled by this hotel I have already booked and paid. First of all BELIEVE bad reviews. They do help. I did so since I could not have money refund (it was the deal of day but I did not look and this was MY mistake and my own fault). Old enough to admit a mistake when I make one. So I stuck with this hotel in October the day I booked it and they charged immediately. I know this was my mistake. But luckily I am an old traveler who knows basic rules that go as well in Hitchhiker's guide trough galaxy: ALWAYS TAKE YOUR OWN SHEETS AND YOUR OWN TOWEL! This literally saved my life. The room they gave me was not the room I have booked it was triple basement room which had so much dust on telephone that the room itself looked like never used before the evidence of past use: the paper from candy left under the bed. Dead roach under the bed for third person (luckily again I was alone) who has been there for God knows how long)...do these people have maids?? I've asked myself. But the next morning I discovered they do since I found new towel in bathroom (I used my own towel as pillow sheet and my own sheet as something clean to lay on. That morning I woke with tremendous stomach cramps. I thought it was just English tea and my gastric problems. But the next morning I woke at 4.30 and to discover that when I get up I do not feel any cramps but if I try to lay down my stomach is killing me. It was then that I realized the thing was about their sheet (I still used mine but I put them on top I didn't remove theirs) I smelled them and it was awful! As if someone died. I thought about Four rooms by Tarantino. So I didn't sleep at all during my stay in London thanks to this hotel that gave me this kind of room. And that horrible smell. I am really tolerant and I can take a lot. But to call yourself a hotel with three stars and charge as much it's really too much! I still like London I didn't let that Hotel ruins my happiness for being in London luckily I booked for two night only it was not that cold so I did not have to use covers (the bed was so grouse that I didn't even want to go in but rather put my sheets on and sleep without any covers). As I am tolerant I haven't said anything and it was two night only. I am pacifist. BUT in any OTHER CASE I would rise war! If this hotel has good rooms I haven't seen any. I will definitely go back to London and stay at the same neighborhood but this hotel I will avoid in big circle. Positive: Location nothing else. And Consigliere very polite and helpful. The lady who was working at reception: very unpleasant and unfriendly. Negative: Rooms.,F3l3y3
UR124977615,2012-21-February,internet cost 2 pounds/hour. It should be free. I first had a room that was renovated and quite nice. I was very happy about it until 6am when i realized that it was next to kitchen and the staff was so loud I could not sleep. I assumed all the rooms are the same quality so wanted to change but they gave me a room with dirty carpet tv had just 5 channels. ( the other room had at-least 26) the room temperature was +30c and someone smoked hash above or below so all the smoke had come in while the window was open. I was then given another room in the basement. That was very moist and and has mould on the wall. I could not open the window to get fresh air. I would not pay more than 50 pounds for a single room. the staff was ok but sometimes they were not around and people were looking for them. Bed was not good.,suska3453
UR126362302,2012-19-March,There were holes in the walls and bathroom door. The towel rack fell off the wall. I put a do not disturb sign on my door but the house keeping staff walked in anyway. The buffet breakfast was disgusting. Tinned tomatoes heated up the coffee is like hot bitter dishwater. I ended up eating breakfast out most mornings. I asked for a 4am wake up call luckily I woke up at 4.15am by chance. I never received the wake up call. I checked out and listened to the staff argue over how many nights I had stayed and If i had paid my account in full... I had prepaid weeks before I arrived. On that subject I had to email and email and call 4 times to finally get the hotel to process the payment and issue me with a receipt. They eventually processed the payment. I then had to follow them up again for a receipt. Absolutely appalling customer service. The corridors are like a rats maze and the carpet is worn and Old. The lifts are scary and ridiculously small. To top all this off after 3 nights I developed what appeared to be a rash. By the end of my stay I went to my doctor who said the red spots on my arms and legs are bed bug bites. My advice to anyone looking for affordable accommodation is to save up a bit more cash and splurge on a hotel with another few stars. this hotel is advertised as 3 stars it would barely make 2 stars. Worst hotel experience EVER.,Suburban_gay
UR123146505,2012-16-January,this is the worst hotel i have ever stayed in!! if you want a hostel then stay here! the rooms are very small and stink! the bathrooms are awful it was that bad i couldnt bring my self to have a shower.. when you arrive the reception looks ok so we were releaved - until we went to the room! the corridors were tiny and dirty with marks all over the walls when your asleep you hear everything!! we heard everything in the room next door in the mornings you heard every up and running along the corridoors. the only nice thing i can say is the breaksfast was nice. i would never stay here again - and for 90 per night it was a complete rip off !! the receptionist was VERY rude aswell !,JENNA T
UR124464452,2012-12-February,when we arrived we waited 10 mins to speak to someone in reception to check in. The rooms are very small and the bathroom even smaller. The shower only worked when it wanted to. We had scaffolding outside our window so no outside light was coming in. I stayed here with my family. The breakfast was disgusting and only one member of staff available who was rude and not willing to help. No mugs or glasses to get a drink. Or forks. and beware of the lady cleaning the tables with the trolley. She's dangerous rude and face like a bulldog chewing a wasp. lifts were very small and dangerous. Door were hanging on one hinge in corridor. Hotel was full of foreigners who were rude! Never again!! Don't let this hotel spoil London because outside of the hotel was amazing!,nat92x
UR125947350,2012-11-March,Stayed on the 5th floor.Corridors were like rat runs & the room was smelly.It smelt of drains.Heating was cranked up to full and it was quite a warm day.Breakfast was like a free for all.They ran out of plates and had to ask at least 3 times for them.The lifts were very scary!!,TheMrsC1970
UR96091731,2011-9-February,I stayed at this hotel last weekend and I must say that I was disappointed by the quality of the room. When I arrived there I thought that everything seemed to be fine since the room was in my view clean and bright. The problems were the breakfast bags (eating two dry croissants isn't breakfast) the shower didn't have enough water pressure to shower under and the absence of remote control for the tv. I of course complained about this to the reception but they couldn't be bothered about it. So I have made a formal complaint to the travel agent who booked this hotel for me I didn't get the value that I paid for. The worst thing was that the shower didn't work I thought it was the biggest fault a hotel can have,LoHel
UR121539143,2011-9-December,The rooms have not been maintained there is paint coming of the walls. The bedroom 411 where we stayed had broken curtains and window latch creaking floor boards toilet and shower drains blocked the room smelt stale and of cigarette smoke. Breakfast was continental with cooked consisting of sausages beans scrambled egg tomatoes and mushrooms. Ok if you like this but it never changed. Be aware of ordering a taxi from here as they have there own people doing it and charge more. This is not a safe hotel we even had our belongings gone through and checked out. Overal a very sad place to stay.,Winno1967
UR95783147,2011-7-February,me and my partner stayed there this weekend for my birthday and our engagement. ... so where do we start. not with anything good to say thats for sure. AVOID THIS PLACE LIKE THE PLAGUE! 1) our room was no good because the shower was blocked. It took another 4 rooms before we got one ... n that still had a dodgy showerbut it 11pm by now. 2) The place was dirty. 3) Apart from 2 the staff we not helpfull and hardly any spoke English. 4) No phones in rooms on 5th floor so beware! 5) The water system especially on 5th floorwas a joke. Showers worked when they wanted the water was cold if you were lucky to get water flow it was poor. 6) Only midgets can access the lifts - no morethan 2 at a time and without bags! 7)Breakfast was a joke. Their was no mention on websites of the dining room being closed. If you do book continental breakfast hope you like apples n cold coissants! But what they dont tell you is you can get a ticket in exchange to have a cooked breakfast in hotel across road. 8) Oh and they cheeking monkeys ask for payment when you arrive. DONT DO IT. Pay only on departure. We paid nothing and cancelled card the following morning so they cant take the money! Overall i really enjoyed it ... NOT! it was disgusting. Fawlty Towers is Buckingham Palace compared to this s***hole. Thanks for ruining my birthday/engagement Queens Hotel -Hotel? Thats a joke!!!!! I should have guessed something wasnt right with the place when i checked in - as i walked in 4 rats with their suitcases walked out.,partyblonde
UR103194520,2011-7-April,OH GOD!! It was actually so horrific that it was hysterical. Firstly we couldn't find it as there's no sign on it it looks like an old run down hostel for the world from the outside Then trying to get our bags to our rooms was terrible - Lifts hahaha the bags wouldn't even fit in it was hysterical tears coming down my face at this stage. So we walked down the stairs with the bags i have bigger muscles now! The room oh god horrific. Different coloured carpets supposed to be three beds so there was a double and two singles but only two pillows when we asked for more we were told there were no more. Shower nozzle was the hold yourself type or don't have one!!!!!!! Not a great neighbourhood to be walking around either..AVOID!!!,Erin068
UR102879966,2011-5-April,During our visit renovations on the hotel check in/business area were undergoing rennovations. I can deal with that ( though it did cause problems since I needed the business area). Lack of hot water is a HUGE issue here it is a ongoing and current problem. Don't stay here if you like to be clean period. Guests were given several excuses on this matter but the truth is the hotel knows this is an issue and they are not dealing with it in a timely matter. (( I will be speaking to Virgin Vacations about this!! )) The rooms were not bad I know this isn't the Ritz and I was not expecting much to be honest. What did surprise me was that apathy of the staff..no one cares. The same "Don't forgot to change your clocks tonight ahead one hour " sign was on the wall by the elevators for days..no one there could be bothered to take it down. Also it could be cleaner the corridors need cleaned..it was pretty weird to see staff walk by trash and not be bothered to pick it up. The breakfast room staff has a nasty attitude. One girl in particular yelled " it isn't open yet" in the snottiest voice as we were walking past . We had no plans to eat there that day ( had an early tour planned ) but we wanted to find out where the room was ..and the next day when we did do breakfast she walked around very unfriendly and gets upset if you get a clean plate to revisit the food. She just oozes "I should not be working with the public" . The front desk is okay they are not warm and welcoming. Also if you need a taxi don't book the overpriced shuttle the hotel will try to get you into..step outside and hail a cab...don't pay 30.00pds for a 8.00pd taxi ride. All in all if you don't expect hot water or a caring staff then book here. If you are looking for a basic room that is a place to sleep and a chance to be on the shower lottery then this is the place for you!!!!,IndyDenise
UR111415789,2011-4-June,I can write a lot of this hotel but there is something so nasty that anything else good or bad simply don't matter. We had a MOUSE IN OUR ROOM!!!! He served himself with some sweets we had in the room and when I get up from the bed he simply run away in front of my eyes!! It was a teryfing experience... We called reception desk immediatelly (it was 1 o'clock in the night) and the guy was nice to change our room with another one; Anyway AWFUL EXPERIENCE!,Dafyda
UR95455832,2011-4-February,IN our opinion all the negative reviews we agree with because that was our experience.When you complain he says take it up with agency you booked with they were informed of building work and should have told you.But that does not excuse the hotel because there is still no mention of building work and dining room being closed all january and possibly february on queens park hotel website,lesmel52
UR114905557,2011-30-June,This is the worst hotel we have ever stayed in. Our bathroom flooded when the guests in the room above us had a shower which meant we couldn't use our bathroom. This was also a fire hazard as the electrics was in the panel in the ceiling. The staff couldn't move us apparantly as there were no more rooms available (I find this hard to believe!). The staff are very unprofessional and do not care about their guests. They wouldn't give us a refund and said there was no manager available at the weekend. The breakfast room is also a shambles. I have seen more order in a school canteen!!,DFagan1980
UR117622776,2011-3-September,we stayed for 2 nights there are two lifts in the hotel of which one was out of order and they only hold 2 people at at time together with this the stairs where out of bounds due to hotel extending into next door. the rooms are over five floors and so you can imagine everyone trying to go up and down to breakfast two at a time!in a very slow lift!!! we decided to try the stairs as is was getting very hot to be met with the stairway boarded up so we went out onto the fire escape to the ground floor and over building area and back into breakfast room Our room was one of the 'new' rooms the toilet seat came off in my husbands hands there was no remote to the telly one thin pillow each and 1 sheet 1 blanket but no bed cover no extra if cold . we will not be going back there.,dihoppo
UR114808809,2011-27-June,The smallest double room ever so small the bedside tables were just wide enough for a cup! The bed was the creakiest bed in the world.No remote for the TV reception found one for me but the batteried were flat. so had to manually operate it....only problem was that it is so high on the wall I had to stand on the bed to perform this. Tea/Coffee not replenished daily. Placed the plug in the sink and couldnt get it out Electronic card key stopped working. Fire escapes blocked with dirty laundry The rooms and corridors are so small that it gets stuffy with no air circulating. Breakfast....go either early or late as it gets very busy and more like a canteen with poor quality produce. No bar facilities. On a plus...its location to Hyde park and the tube are to be commended,Andrew5061
UR117315260,2011-27-August,We stayed here for 3 days. Positive's- breakfast and location is very good. Negative's - Wifi not free unfriendly and cold staff. staff do not care about guests. since our room was on the side where construction work had just begin. so our window was totally blocked.,Kj_1409
UR94538716,2011-26-January,Arrived to hotel . as soon as we entered reception area which looked like a dump/building site!! With scabby furniture  paint peeling off walls. We checked in and we were explained about having our breakfast in a bag (ridiculous) because breakfast area was been refurbished nothing about this when we booked - very misleading. We continued on to go and see our room waiting for the lift the geenral cleanliness was horrific. dirty walls  door knobs dirty handprints all over walls. as we walked to the rooms the floor was even sinking! Got tot he damp smelling room. Dirty looking bed covers with blankets you wouldnt even use for the farm animals. We decided to check out and explained to receptionist we are disgusted with quality of hotel. She then replied 'ok'  'no problem' !! - Please book else where dont waste your time with this hotel!!!,muricia1951
UR118566367,2011-25-September,what can we say. we had a room that you literally could not swing a cat in. we were not told about the building work being done to the hotel we had scaffolding outside our window for the 4 days we were there and yes you have guessed it we couldnt see a thing because of the huge polythene screen that was put up by the builders. we felt totally claustrophobic. we were woken up every morning at 7.30 with hammering drilling etc.we work hard for our holiday break and are disgusted that we had to put up with that. oh and before we forget if your expecting a good breakfast then go out for one.,551weeble
UR119718857,2011-25-October,I stayed this hotel february 2011. I just sign up last month and i should write my old experience about this hotel. I think this hotel's location is good. In thirty second you can arrive hyde park by walking and location is so close the underground station (queensway) central line. So this mean you can reach too many places with this line. Also in my opinion price is cheap. We stayed 7 nights in double room including breakfast 335 pound. That's so reasonable to stay in central location in london. Moreover hotel rooms are too small but i think it should not be a big problem for young travelers. My advice; if your expectation is not too high and you will visit some places whole time in your day. This hotel satisfy your need.,CinarK
UR114734640,2011-25-June,Rubbish disgusting can't even get duvets one pillow cold shower,Alison150376
UR101289843,2011-23-March,We booked this place as it seemed in a good location and was reasonably priced and it looked OK from the pictures and description on various websites I browsed before deciding.First impressions were not good old tatty reception resturaunt was closed for refurbishment which was supposed to be completed 2 weeks before we stayed. The lifts were so small you couldnt fit 2 people in with luggage so we went to the 4th floor by stairs. the corridors are so narrow that you cant pass another person with luggage without one person giving way.the whole place is grubby and tired. The " lavish" room we were staying in was supposed to be "recently refurbished" with sat TV radio trouser press and other stuff that wasnt there.It was pokey grubby the shower was useless the bathroom was so small you had the sink right over you when you sat down.The toilet seat was broken and brerakfast was in a paper bag in the room due to refurb. I imagine now that the refurb has probably been completed this will not make a blind bit of difference. Now the good bits....er er none apart for location and thats it. AVOID,Wolvesmad33
UR120860099,2011-21-November,Like the other reviewers we felt the lifts small room was also small.The bed was against the wall making it difficult to get out of.The bathroom was also tiny .Water dribbled out of shower and luke warm and we had to request a sink plug.Breakfast was not bad but as things ran out were not replaced until a guest requested.,nannaPaignton
UR120828067,2011-20-November,On arraving at the hotel first impression very good nice clean reception. They asked for 20 out of my account which i was fine with. Went to get the lift which was so small that me and my girlfriend could barely fit in with our suitcase and it took forever to come down. Trying to find our room was a nightmare with the carpet on route looking really old and worn. Got to our room and was not impressed was very small for a double with light swiches hanging off the wall bed sheet disgusting and looking warn. My girlfriend after waking up had bits all over her. Going into the bathrrom was small tiny shower dust on the toliet sheet and basen. Was disgusting it STANK was awuful didnt even want to go in there. we were staying only 2 nights but after gettig back we were expecting our room to be cleaned which was not done for them to just walk in at 5 o'clock. Found it amazing that there was no information pack to give you numbers to call reception or anything. TV so small could barely see it. Breakfast was inedable corrisants werent cooked egg runny no bacon. im very dissapointed at the amount i paid for the hotel i would definatly mot stay here again and would not reccomend this hotel at all.,sophie w
UR104732999,2011-20-April,I wanted a cheap overnight stay in London and booked this last minute. Due to the ongoing refurb on the ground floor the reception was a tiny 3M x 3M with stairs to the first floor to catch an Elevator. The corridor was barely 4ft wide and the floor is uneven with creaky floorboards everywhere. The room was Very Small and the walls are paper thin. The rooms are in desperate need of a paint job and the carpet in my room had a large bleach stain by the shower room. The room TV only has the basic analogue channels and the picture quality was lousy. The shower room was clean and adequately sized. The continental breakfast is a joke Soft rolls shaped like croissants bland sliced cheese tinned fruit pieces and a toaster that burns bread on one side and doesnt toast the other. For me it was just a somewhere to lay my head for one night but I certainly would not consider using this hotel for any longer than one night. It would drive me to depression staying any longer.,Wa5te
UR97197195,2011-19-February,arrived home last night after a 4 day break staying at the queens park hotel bayswater booked by my children through superbreak for my 50th birthday the hotel is in a super location ideal for all the sights but the hotel well thats another matter rooms not clean you could scrape dirt off the internal side of the window frames the wooden toilet seat had all chips and chuncks out of it tv did not work bed linen just about scrapped through breakfast wa a laugh dining room was closed so breakfast was served in your room it arrived in a small brown paper bag and consisted of a small carton of juice a dry croissant jam and butter yogurt cereal bar and apple with a small plastic spoon and knife no fresh tea or coffee you had to use your courtsey tray and you had to eat off your bed as there was no table or chairs no appologies were made and where it gets its 3* status from I do not know I would not give it 1 staff are ignorant and un-helpful all this put a dampner on what was a lovely trip we had to make the best of a bad situation. disgruntled from Barnsley,elainetrickett
UR118244342,2011-17-September,We stayed at the Queens Park Hotel for 1 night while passing through London. Its location was very good being only a couple of minutes walk from Kensington Park 15mins walk from Paddington Railway Station and fantastic for access to London in general. However on checking in the hotel had no details of our booking although this was found after approx 15 minutes. The problem seemed to be dealt with in an inefficient manner with it being handed from one member of staff to another with no one seeming to take the lead. No apology was received for this error from any member of the staff including the management. The lift to our room seemed to take ages to arrive. In fact it was at our floor but the door had failed to open. A passing cleaner noticed us and the problem and banged the door with his hand opening it. Needless to say we had no confidence in the lifts after this. Furthermore if you are claustrophobic don't take them! Although the sign said it could take 4 it was a struggle for for the two of us to fit in with two medium cases. Our room was very small but I suppose it was adequate in size for one night's stay. The bed was uncomfortable and the walls were thin between the rooms. Consequently we didn't get a good night's sleep. The small shower room although very small was clean. Breakfast was poor. The croissants appeared to be uncooked. The tables were cleared in front of us with the food waste being emptied straight into an open slops bucket. Not very appealing or professional in my opinion. The highlight of our stay was the ability to leave our luggage at the hotel after we had checked out until the end of the day for only 1 per case. The concierge was the best member of staff by a very long way being friendly and efficient. He seemed pleased to do a good job. We wont be using the hotel again.,Dolcoath
UR113777231,2011-16-June,160 quid a night for a small hot room with no air conditioning. Think Steve McQueen in the great escape and you're not far wrong. Take a baseball glove and ball and you're good to go. Seriously just stay somewhere else.,Deakus
UR108366244,2011-15-May,Stayed here on May 14th with my husband. Disaster from the start. Completely disgusted and would never stay here again nor would I recommend it to friends unless they had a demolition licence. Check-in is stated as 2pm. We actually arrived early and called in to see where the hotel was and was told to return at 2pm which we did. After checking in we were asked to wait our rooms were ready at 3pm. Our room was situated on the 1st floor and we were directed to use the back stairs to get to it. Carpets and walls were stained throughout the tiny narrow corridors and walking past the kitchen there was a rather unpleasant smell. Traversing the corridor is made all the more fun by the obstacle course of abandoned hoovers piles of laundry and black refuse sacks left in random corners. All doors squeaked creaked or banged (including the one situated right outside our room) . The room... Tiny room. This would have been easily overlooked given the age of the hotel were it not for the disgusting condition of the room. Walls carpet curtains and base of bed stained repeatedly throughout (bed appeared to have water damage). Damaged mis-matched furniture broken and stained. Very sharp broken edge on the desk. Open screw-holes in the wall where a headboard had obviously been removed and many other holes in the wall where pictures fixtures etc had obviously been removed. Stained mis-matched bedding very old blanket pilled and tatty and the bedspread appeared to be a single attempting to cover a double bed. Dirty spare blanket in the wardrobe (strange smell in there too) but no spare pillows. Two flat stained pillows on the bed. Window latch falling off window impossible to close without balancing precariously on the edge of the bed. TV very old and dirty had four poor-reception terrestrial channels no sound on any of them no matter how high the volume was turned and no remote. There were NO fire regulations/directions anywhere in the room at all (every drawer and wardrobe was checked). I was under the impression that this was illegal/against regulations? No air-conditioning and building work made spending any time in the room with the window open unbearable. We tried to grab some sleep that afternoon which we found impossible due to the building work. VERY noisy building work and cleaning staff (believe it or not given the state of the rooms they actually have a cleaner we saw her) during the day guests crashing around and noise from the street at night. No instructions for phone ie how to contact reception/other rooms. Back of radiator clogged with dust and dirt and smelled bad. No lock on bathroom door door handle didn't work properly. Broken/cracked tiles and very dirty grouting particularly in corners. Floor very uneven. Toilet seat broken and wobbly. Pedal bin not working. On closer inspection realised this was because the lid was completely detatched and balanced on in position to make it look as if it was still attached. Toilet took at least three button-pushes to complete a proper flush. Larger persons squashed up (ie actually touching both sides) of wall and shower cubicle when using the toilet. Water pressure passable. Taps on sink very stiff to turn especially cold. Towels were clean with a nice fresh smell of detergent however the bath towels were minute. As I was taking all of this in in my husband found the crowning glory to our stay...A Rentokil Rodenticide trap behind the bedside cabinet. *shudder* Husband and I both slept fully dressed on top of the bed covers to avoid having to actually touch the horrible bedding. On check-in the receptionist was very helpful and the lobby appears much better than in previous reviews now being finished in white marble with leather furniture for guests and smart reception/concierge desks. Initial appearances give no indication of the horrors within. Concierge was surly and with (it seemed) very poor English. I skipped breakfast at the hotel ("mouse traps in the rooms what's going on in the kitchen?!" mentality) however my husband's review: Had to wait 20 minutes for a table. No bacon in cooked breakfast. Poor toaster had to put bread through twice to achieve a decent colour! Only one person clearing tables. No recognisable brands on display. Yoghurts not cold. During our stay my husband stopped in at reception to purchase two bottles of water from a fridge beside reception (water or cans of Coke no prices on display). Member of staff behind reception charged him 3 cash didn't ask for a name or room number. When it came time to check out two bottles of water had been charged to room service on our friend's room next door. On trying to explain that we had already paid cash we were met with a grilling on time of purchase who did we pay what did they look like how much did we pay suspicion and assurances that "If the takings do not show 3 up your booking card will be charged." Our complaints about the room and specifically the mouse trap were literally glossed over our comments were not even acknowledged the receptionist continued the conversation with "Thank you for staying enjoy the rest of your day." Also the hotel attempted to take payment four days before we were due to check in from the card left supposedly just to hold the room until we paid on check-in. After putting the money "On hold" on the card (takes five days to get it lifted) staff then attempted to charge us again and deny that they could simply use the money that they had put on hold despite us having an e-mail from the hotel confirming that this was possible. Badly maintained and badly run. Overall I was completely disgusted with the hotel there is no way in hell this is a three-star hotel. Had we had another option we would have checked out immediately after seeing the room unfortunately we were stuck.,Sarah_Sheffield_UK
UR115355554,2011-14-July,When we came in there were other customers complaining at the reception. We soon would learn why. Although we arrived nearly at 3pm our rooms were not ready yet and the receptionist declined to make a firm statement when they would be. They were also impolite to rude. In the rooms the light in the bathroom was broken. As was the trashbin. The toiletseat was swollen up with some mold on the underside. The bed was clean and the room was small but acceptable. When trying to call the reception one evening first they did not take up the phone then they actually picked up the reciever just to put it down again instead of answering. I would never visit that hotel again. With friendly staff this would have been an OK stay but this way you felt unwelcome and spending your money for keeping the wrong people in employ. The breakfast was simple but sufficient baked beans sausages egg toast jam butter and yoghurt and croissants. Nice sliced oranges too. The street was quite loud outside with renovations going on next door.,travelerforfrs
UR120521455,2011-13-November,A small hotel with one of the smallest elevators I have ever seen. The bathroom smelled so bad it woke us up in the middle of the night. The cleaning lady folded wet towels which led to damp and cold towels to dry us the day after. For breakfast they served toast with jam or cheese traditional english breakfast directly from cans. Nothing but the scrambled eggs were home made or fresh. The building site just outside our window was active from 7 am friday saturday and sunday. The fact that sheets and showers were clean prevent me from rate the hotel Terrible.,ftamk

UR117963956,2011-12-September,We booked this hotel as a family group for one night as we were going to the proms in the park location suited us unfortunately we read the reviews after booking. A little concerned about the hotel taking payment from our card before we had arrived.Whenever we have stayed in hotels before we have always paid on departureobviously this doesn't bode well if you try to get a refundwhich I am guessing happens often enough for them to take payment first. Still I thought give it the benefit of the doubt. We arrived to check in around 3pm to find one of our three rooms wasn't ready (resolved after half an hour).In the twin room my mother found one of the beds had a soaking wet mattress this must have been noticed when the bed was made as there were some towels under it in an attempt to dry it out. The occupants were moved into another room only to find out when we returned from the concert that this room had no electrics...you would think after the first room they would have made sure this one would be fit for purpose.So after all that they were moved into room number 3 at 1.30am. Our room was small but cleanone of the lights didn't work and the shaver point in the bathroom (I use this term loosely) wasn't working either. I have a feeling the hotel raided an old POW camp for the bedding the blanket we were provided with was itchy and so not much sleep was to be had. If you suffer from claustrophobia then for gods sake give the lifts a very wide berth someone has jokingly put a sign in them saying 4 persons..if you try this then I would advise you know the people you share with as you will be getting very intimate with them. Breakfast was ok apart from the fact they didn't have enough knives! When we asked for some more we were told they were all out? As with others who have commented when we asked to see a manager about a refund for my mothers trouble we were told no-one is here please call back tomorrow,jesoid
UR120496480,2011-12-November,We had the extreme misfortune to use this "hotel" for one night in a 'double room which was so small we had to swap places in order to move within the room! The bathroom was MINUTE more like a cubicle.Breakfast was a free-for-all with insufficient seating and limited choice of VERY mediocre food.When checking out at 09:00 we asked if we could leave our luggage and were informed it would cost 1 per item to use the 'left luggage room'.When we said we would return our cases to our room until check-out time of 12:00 we were told that was fine????. This appears to be some sort of 'scam' on behalf of the staff...PLEASE PLEASE AVOID this apology for a hotel AT ALL COSTS!!!,David L
UR116552443,2011-11-August,Date :9th July 2011 We booked this hotel for just one night based on its availability and location in Central London. Even though this Hotel is Centraly located - it has to have possibly the worst rooms we have ever stayed in. The room had space for only one person to move around - though we has asked for a family room for 4. This was supposed to be the big size. It had space for only one small suitcase a tiny window close to the ceiling (which had no value). However it did have a TV wall mounted. The toilet was okay. From a cleanliness point of view it would just about pass the mark. The elevator was so small - that we had to go down 4 times to get the luggage all up and the corridor to the room would be a protential fire hazard. It would be hard for a person and luggage to move through that. The only thing that was nice about the Hotel - was the breakfast and the staff. The breakfast was a full English breakfast and the staff were friendly and helpful specially with the kids. If you have any other alternative Hotel to stay in in Central London please do not book here. It is just not worth it. It had also had no WIFI.,alifiyan
UR55547783,2010-9-February,Tiny Lift peeling paint and wallpaper everywhere. tiny room. Tiny bathroom. Tiny mouse run around floor 5. Stains on sheets. Stains on carpet in room. Could not turn off radiator in room. Had to climb over wife to move around room. More could be said but I think that this was enough. We walked out and got another hotel within 1 hour of checking into this dump.,tonyuk36
UR52808039,2010-7-January,I took my parents to London in 2008 and booked this hotel due to its nice location half a block from Hyde Park and a couple blocks from the tube. The lobby looked nice but omg once we got to the room we were horrified. There were white stains on the carpet (don't even ask me where I think that came from) and a rusty-colored stain on one of the sheets (blood?). The beds were seriously a joke...I felt each and every spring I couldn't believe the poor bed was still in use! Must've been as old as the hotel was. I would rather have slept on the floor but the stains.... There were broken things here and there like the toilet paper dispenser which was not a big problem since you don't really need it but nevertheless annoying because you'd think hotels would maintain their rooms a bit. However I do have to say that the staff was really wonderful hence the 5 stars for service. They were nice brought up lots of towels when we asked for them and conversed with my dad for a while as though they were long-time friends. They also helped give us advice on where we should go what tube stop would be closest etc. Breakfast is also included which consists of toast cereal coffee juice and some pastries. The service was actually really great cuz even during the help yourself type of breakfast right when you chose a table they heated up toast and brought it right to you piping hot. I thought that was really thoughtful. All-in-all fantastic location. It all would've been nice if I wasn't so grossed out by stains and if I didn't really need sleep (you won't get any on those beds)!,LDarling87
UR55387927,2010-7-February,My friend and I stayed at this hotel for a long weekend. The room was tiny and did not have a bedside light. The kettle base was held together with.....wait for it.......cardboard and sellotape! I kid you not. Old blankets on the bed. Reception seen better days. Breakfast was plentiful but don't get the tea. The bathroom was the best feature being clean and modern. Staff indiferrent. Good location though. Dog outside barked most of the night. Truly? Forget it!,LULU1515
UR74159273,2010-7-August,Ideally situated at less than 5 minutes walk from 2 metro stations (Bayswater/Queensway) and as regarded from the outside a beautiful building this hotel rapidly turns over into a very awful accommodation. The first problem you encounter is the elevator.When arriving with four persons with in total 2 medium suitcases (bags) and you have to mount to the fifth floor you might expect an elevator large enough to lift you up .There are two of them : one not functioning and the other one suited to get only one (not claustrophobic) person with 2 bags up to the wanted rooms. The other guests have to mount the stairs. You arrive in your room to find out that it is very small  that the safe doesn't open and the water heater doesn't function nor does the hairdryer. The curtains are damaged and the mirror in the wardrobe is broken.In the other room n the safe does not open either. In the bathroom the shower gives nothing (certainly not hot water). When we signal it to the reception they promise to do something about it but nothing happens. The next day we go downstairs to breakfast and first we have to wait because the too small dinner room is occupied. The breakfast itself consists of very moderate bread to toast + "croissants" I didn't even finish and corn flakes. There is also fruit salad (out of tin) . There were no eggs meat (bacon sausages or salami)  yoghourt not even choco or cheese. We were very happy we only booked for 2 nights in that hotel and the next breakfast we had was at the Starbucks in the neighbourhood. Other item : the toilets on the ground floor are not clean. Luckily for us we didn't have to stay all the time in this hotel. The weather was not bad and London has so many wonderful places to visit we easily could do without this "hotel",visitorMD
UR66610015,2010-6-June,We arrived at our very small roomsthe heat was unbearable with no air con or vans we went out as soon as we had dropped bags off.The Shower leeked all over the floorAfter many trips to the reception they could not care less and was very rude!!!

UR69755490,2010-5-July,We were here for 3 nights and so happy to leave. It started off with poor desk service. The receptionist was very off hand and disinterested. We had to pay the full amount up front before even seeing the room. Going up to our room we had the experience of the smallest lift ever seen. It barely fit us with one suitcase each and not good for anyone who is slightly claustrophobic! After leaving the lift walked through very dirty corridors with carpet that looked like it had not been cleaned for a couple of weeks. When we got to the room which was very small it was criminally hot - it would have been over 30 degrees celcius even with the window open! Within about 2 minutes we were in a sweat. There was no air conditioning and after talking to reception found out that only a couple of the floors have A/C (but there is only one control per floor!) - we were on the 5th which is a new floor and no a\c had yet been set up! When we asked for a fan we were told they didn't have any! The Internet which the hotel listed as being provided at a charge (5 for 3 hours) was down for 2 of the 3 days we were there with varying reasons as to why it wasn't available with the receptionists just shrugging their shoulders and saying "maybe tomorrow". It finally became available on our last day where we could access it using our laptop in the lobby (not available in guest rooms). We were desperate to get in touch with family but did not have a phone in our room either (just a jack point). When we checked with staff we found out that the rooms on our floor had not been wired up with a phone yet - "I can find you a phone but it won't work". Great! We only had breakfast for one of the three mornings because it was not good - very bland and a poor selection of stale rolls and cereal. The only slightly good thing about the hotel was that the room had a fairly good bathroom and shower. It is not worth it though - if you have any other option take it as this would be an absolute last choice - I would rather sleep in a hostel than take this place again. We had to pay 150 per night for this experience which is a complete rip off - I would be annoyed to even pay half of that for this type of accommodation and service.,TravelBugNZ78
UR66398656,2010-4-June,I was booked into this hotel by First Choice a TUI company acting for Superbreak and had no reason to expect it to be other than a clean and reasonable hotel as we were given thisl advice by a "reputable" travel organisation. On the eve of our visit I read the reviews whilst looking up the location in order to find out how to get there. I immediately booked an alternative hotel as I did not want to put our health at risk by staying there. I contacted Superbreak asking them to cancel my booking and refund my hotel bill. On my return I also contacted First Choice. Neither organisation has replied to my e-mails. They have not even attempted to refute the claims on Tripadvisor leaving me with the only view that as long as they have your money they do not care where they locate you.,newcastlecitybreaker
UR78112785,2010-3-September,Firstly I would like to start by saying that when I contacted the hotel via e mail requesting a room without carpets and one with windows that open onto a road my request was honoured. My husband and I were very disappointed with the shabbiness of the hotel reception and the fact that only one lift was working as the other lift was out of order since before 23rdJuly 2010 as a note on the 5th floor had a paper attached to the lift promising the clients that the lift will be in order by then. The only lift in operation was about one and a half feet deep by four feet wide. The room was very very clean but so small that there was a small table on one side of the bed. The room had no air condition nor a fan and the weather was quite warm in the twenties. On departure we were asked to pay for leaving our suitcases in a safe place and this was never quoted on their website. Breakfast was consisting of canned fruit salad bread jams and fruit juice. I dont think that we got value for money and would never recommend this hotel to anyone. When I complained with both the receptionist and the gentleman who looks after the tours all I got from this gentleman was that one can never please everyone.,VickiHamburg
UR69050735,2010-29-June,Had a Weekend stay at the Queens Hotel and on the last night our groundfloor room was broken into. The hotel staff were of no help at all and kept telling us it would be passed onto the manager. We asked for the Police to be involved but knew little could be done by them although they were very helpful .We had to ask to be moved to another room for our last night. Next morning before we left we expected to meet the Hotel Manager only to be told he was again unavailable. Since arriving home I have contacted the hotel by phone and e:mail but I'm just wasting my time. The break-in was caused by a door in our room leading to the street not being secured.,DundeeSilverfox
UR88094076,2010-24-November,a very disappointing stay at the Queens Park Hotel it is convenient to the tube the concierge was not able to help with most of our requests the desk staff could not help with placing an international call the breakfast was minimal and not appealing. Only one lift was in operation (and it is very small)....,peaksgram
UR54223761,2010-24-January,My girlfriend and I travelled to London for some sightseeing and to see some shows. We booked this hotel as part of a theatre break and all we can say is that on the whole our trip to london was great but the hotel left a lot to be desired. On check-in we asked for a iron and iron board to be bought up to our rooms at which point the receptionist on duty gave us an iron (our hands were full with our luggage) and told us to get a board from the concierge desk. We maybe should have taken that as an indicator for the remainder of our stay. We went up to our room via two lifts as both of us and our luggage couldn't fit into just one lift. The one lift could hold just two people without any bags. The other was just slightly bigger. Both lifts are in desperate need of a refurb as is the rest of the hotel. When we got to our room we couldn't believe just how small it was. The room was the size of a single room with a double bed in it. If I wanted to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night I had to climb over my girlfriend as there wasn't enough space to get out of my side of the bed and walk around it. There were scuff marks on the walls the carpet was grubby and generally the the room was in disrepair and in desperate need of a refurb. I also wanted to put some things in the room safe however I discovered that it was locked with no instructions on how to open it. I called down to reception and they said they would send someone up immediately. No one materialised even though I told them we would be leaving in a half hour. We went out to the theatre and upon our return we found that someone had been into the room and opened the safe and not left any instructions. We also noticed that there was no-one on reception when we got back (this was to be a common sight throughout our stay). Breakfast on all mornings was disorganised and chaotic with staff helping themselves to breakfast and eating behind the counter in full view of guests. They would also play on their phones and read the papers while the buffet was being neglected. The buffet was also nothing special. Two cereals two fruit juices tinned fruit salad and grapefruit segments croissants rolls bread for toasting and tea and coffee. The toaster seemed to be faulty - it was on full heat but you still had to put your toast through twice to just get a semblance of colour on it. The breakfast room itself was also shabby and how they coped with breakfast in that small room I don't know. It is best to get in first thing otherwise you might not have a table. The radiator in the room didn't have any means of turning down the heat and there was only a very small window that could open. When we returned back to the hotel on the second night we found that reception was empty and the front door left unlocked. Surely that is a serious security problem. Also no-one stopped us at any point to check if we were actually residents in the hotel. On our last night they neglected to put in a bath mat - we tried phoning down to reception every 5 minutes or so for more than half an hour but no-one answered. We had discovered a sweets wrapper on one side of the bed which wasn't removed at all during our stay. Another point to make is that they still use extremeley scratchy blankets to make up the beds - come on people! If you're going to make up the beds with blankets at least use a better quality! We wanted to complain at the end of our stay - yet again there was no-one around. Checkout was rushed - gave our room number then we were told "everything was fine" and the receptionist (same one who checked us in) turned to the next guest. They also advertise a business centre on their website - this consists of a computer and printer set up in the middle of the reception area. You wouldn't dare use it as everyone is able to see on the screen. We could have accepted all of this as we now realise that it is a budget hotel however the hotels website is extremely misleading and I quote: "Our aim is to provide the highest standards of service and hospitality with the comfort and facilities you would expect of a modern luxury hotel while preserving the traditional character of the property itself. You can be sure of a warm and friendly welcome at the Queens Park Hotel" The hotel in my opinion doesn't adhere to anyone of these things and I can honestly say that when I go to London again I would rather pay extra and maybe stay with a reputable group. Ons thing that was a HUGE plus during our stay: Izakaya Hi Sushi in Katherine Street makes the best sushi we have ever had!!!,redbear81
UR84175704,2010-20-October,This is a last resort place. Hey all if you want to sleep----FORGET it!!! There is a 8 story Youth Hostel directly across the street and they party loudly all night.. The youth have to leave the Hostel to smoke and guess where they go??? Directly onto the street and sidewalk in front of the Hotel...All Night Teen Party!!! Twin room??? Ha!! We had to basically jump over the crushed together twin beds to get to the bathroom. The staff if friendly but we had nails and screws sticking out of our room carpet peeling paint and wallpaper bare bones continental breakfast all down a seedy street . We did not sleep for three days.,5rweinmd
UR58503724,2010-13-March,They can take a reservation but don't know how to hold it. Booked 3 twins got 3 doubles. Had to fight to get one changed. Fire alarm went off at random times 4 out of the 6 days we were there. Elevators worked one day. The one person elevator worked 5 days out of 6 serving 5 floors. Peeling wallpaper etc. good location and okay breakfast but otherwise beware.,terdec
UR61235311,2010-13-April,I came home with scabies from this hotel. It is disgusting and I will NEVER stay here again. DO NOT believe the pictures that you see on the internet. The rooms do not look like that. They are dirty with stains on the bedding and obviously bugs. The beds are not beds but movable cots that are so horrible that I had a back ache the entire 10 days of the hotel. As of that was not bad enough the street outside was horribly loud all night long. Every night I was woken up at least 3 times. The lift is hazardous and yet I had to use it to get my luggage up the 4 flights of stairs. I never knew if I was going to make it once those doors closed. In addition to that the food was disgusting- nothing fresh and dirty dishes. The only good things I can say about this hotel are the concierge from Ethiopia was very sweet and I was so GLAD to leave it. Honestly I got home on April 1st and had to go to the doctor as soon as I was home to get treated for the disease that I picked up from the hotel. It has now cost me over $200 for the doctor's visit and the ensuing treatment. HORRIBLE!!!!!! Also NO FREE wi-fi and although they advertise wi-fi it is only the lobby. Again they should face some sort of penalty for the false advertising! The business center is a computer stuck in the corner of the lobby.,cbaker17
UR69365757,2010-1-July,Our hopes were high on arrival after seeing an Aston Martin and Range Rover parked outside but soon shot down as we got inside had to pay upfront walk past an original Windows 95 computer and squeeze into a lift the size of a shoebox that took about 3days to go just a few floors. It was either that or use the maze of tight stairways to get there. So in no particular order here's a list of reasons not to stay at this "hotel". - Tiny room - Bedside cabinets are a plank of wood with drawers that aren't even drawers - High dryer works at 5 second intervals before needing a 5 minute breather - No air-con or hint of a breeze so hot and sticky - Windows that go out onto the fire escape (not the safest or private) - Toilet that's basically in the shower - Toilet that wouldn't stop dripping and wouldn't refill properly - Shower door that wouldn't close so soaked the floor - Most uncomfortable supposedly double bed i've been in/on since they put an old woolen blanket on in it for some reason in the summer - TV that was too high on the wall and signal was shocking and had no remote - Cupboard that stank - Thin walls so you can hear everyone else complaining about their rooms aswell and more - Awful breakfast; they somehow managed to get fresh orange juice wrong - Bathroom door that got stuck on the floor when opening One positive to mention though - the chair in the room was really nice except it probably shouldn't have been in there considering that extra empty space in the room would have been useful,ComeOnTim
UR40007877,2009-7-September,stayed here for a weekend with friends never again! Upon arrival there were four guests at the reception voicing loud complaints about their rooms. We arrived at 11am and were told we could not check in till two 'o' clock. Eventually when we did check in we were given room 108 which was absolutely filthy. The wallaper was peeling off the walls ceiling was black with damp filthy curtains carpet and dirty blankets on the bed! The bathroom had been cleaned though but the overpowering smell of bleach made our eyes water. The bath was ancient and was so high I nearly needed a forklift truck to get into it. No plugs for the bath or handbasin so no choices had to use the stoneage shower which was over the bath and kept falling off the wall! Upon complaining to reception staff we were moved to room 103 which was only about 1% better. Continental breakfast consisted of brown or white soggy toast the cheapest brand cornflakes or rice crispies and tinned fruit. The piece de resistance was the rude brusque noisy and utterly unsociable breakfast staff! Be warned never ever stay at this "hotel" a term I would use very loosely wormwood scrubs would be cleaner and the prison warders probably more friendly! Dont know how this dump was ever awarded three stars.,michael039
UR25640581,2009-5-March,Booked this hotel at the last minute as needed to be in London for just one night and seeing as the cost of the stay was within my budget decided to go for it. The location is fine for the money and the hotel/room was clean. Was disappointed in the overall standard of the room. It was in dire need of a makeover: scuffed marks on the walls the bathroom door had a hole in it no bedside light matress was worn out and only ONE bedsheet between and the matress itself (shouldn't there be a matress protector or something??). The TV remote didn't work. I didn't complain as was only there for one night so on this occasion the hotel served its purpose... and as they say you get what you pay for.,RTWUK
UR33877958,2009-4-July,It was a couple of years since we stayed here but seemingly from the other reviews this hotel is still as bad as it was. The room we stayed in was old tatty and unattractive. The whole room just felt grubby and dingy. The shower room was awful - peeling wallpaper and damp walls. The breakfast was awful - you had to go down into the dining room and help yourself from the meagre selection of white bread and jam and cheap ham and cheese. You had to queue to use the one toaster and when the few plates on the side had gone and we stuck our head in the kitchen to ask for another the girl grumpily pointed to the just washed ones on the side of the sink and made us dry them ourselves! After the first day we preferred to eat breakfast in a cafe. I know this hotel is cheap but it was so miserable staying there. I am sure there us better at this price in London - the handy location of this in no way makes up for the standard of the hotel.,HannahJW
UR24184784,2009-3-February,My husband I traveled to London for our honeymoon. Being newlyweds we didn't have much money and we didn't want to spend all of it on the room. We booked the trip through a travel agency and they actually had us at a different hotel but had to change the reservation at the last minute. We'd seen pictures of the other place so we knew what we were in for with that hotel but there were no pictures of this hotel to prepare us for the shock. The outside of the hotel was beautiful. It was clean and freshly painted and in a lovely area of town convenient to the underground and walking distance to several shops. Actually if you've seen National Lampoon's European Vacation you've seen the hotel. It's under a different name and the interior is a set but it's the hotel that the Griswold's pull up to on the British leg of their tour. Just a bit of useless trivia. We were pleasantly surprised that we were allowed to check in early and not made to loiter around the lobby for the several hours until the actual check-in time. That was our last bit of good news. We both knew the room would be small but we're also both the type that can live with pretty much anything as long as the room is clean and there's a private bathroom--which this had thank goodness. We certainly weren't expecting pillow mints and turn-down service. This room wasn't small. It wasn't tiny. It was miniscule. In order to get dressed in the mornings one of us had to stand on the bed (generally me since I'm shorter and my husband kept hitting his head on the ceiling). We had one large bag and two carry-ons and came very close to having to leave one of the carry-ons in the hall just to fit in the room. The bed was large and comfortable. The room and bath were clean and nicely decorated. The lights worked when they felt like it--never all at the same time. The bathroom light went out rendering the room pitch black and maintenance said they'd get someone up the next day. That I could live with. The toilet stopped flushing and maintenance said they'd get someone up the next day. That I could NOT live with. We ran out of toilet paper and maintenance said they'd get some up the next day. COME ON! We constantly had to keep going to the front desk to get things like towels (needed one each) soap etc. that should have been in the room each day. Two people can not go 5 days on one foil packet of shampoo. When I called down to let them know that the radiator was broken the front desk employee actually SIGHED. Now I'm one to look for the humor in situations and I find it hilarious that on my honeymoon in London I got three BBC channels and not one of them carried Doctor Who. They were also all staticy. We did however watch Borat on our neighbor's big screen tv by looking out our window into theirs. I guess that's something. The continental breakfast is alright but nothing to write home about. There are no snack or soda machines but there is a Tesco grocery around the corner. This hotel will always have a place in my heart because it was where I spent the first few days of my marriage and I look back on it fondly but honestly neither of us want to relive that. We'll go somewhere else next trip.,buddybear1221
UR26970212,2009-28-March,Basement room very small and in desparate need of redecoation. Reception staff were friendly but not so the dining room staff. On our last day at breakfast the chief walked through from the kitchen area in a filthy white jacket. Not what you want to see! Location was good though for the tube and a good choice of local restaurants within easy walking distance.,Highland02
UR28843669,2009-27-April,We checked into this hotel for a flying visit of 2 nights. We stayed 1 and that was only because we couldnt find another hotel we could afford during our first nights stay on short notice. It takes a while to get to the hotel as its a walk from the Bayswater stop on the Underground .We arrived at the hotel early and asked if we could check in - they said no so we asked could we drop our bags. "Sure you can sir its 5 a bag" Rediculous. So off we went to sight see e.t.c when we returned we were given a room in the basement of the hotel - it had 2 windows so dirty we could hardly see out of them. They were around 10 inchs long and at the very top of the wall - similar to a prison cell. The radiator was mounted on a piece of wood on the wall - which fell down the morning we checked out. The toilet had excrement stains on the bottom of it the sink plug hole was half blocked so that the water filled the bath during a shower and took 10 minutes to empty. The shower curtain was mouldy - black and green. The bed+clothes where torn and old. The wall paper was peeling and the carpet ripped. There were stains every where. After my girlfriend had been struck by the radiator on the wall we had enough. I spoke to the lady on the front desk who was not a proper memeber of staff but rather a backpacker who worked weekends in the hotel to pay for her room. She was actually very nice and she came to our room to verify what we were complaining about. There was no person in the hotel on Saturday or Sunday that could authorise an early check out. I argued with the "Manager" on the phone for over 25 minutes explaining that I expected a full refund given the disgraceful room we had receieved that the harm caused to my girlfriend. He insisted that the room was fine and that we would be charged an early check out charge. We spent hours of our second day looking for another hotel we could stay and traveling to it. This hotel ruined our trip and was DISGUSTING! If you read any other reviews I have written on other hotels in the same price range as this you will see that we are not easily annoyed by hotel nor put off by locations. This hotel is a health hazard and should be closed. Please do not stay here!,gseire123
UR35832070,2009-26-July,Maybe i'm geting old but I did not enjoy this place!

I stayed the next night in Epping SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO much nicer hotel and breakfast was help yerself if you can find a table spare! basic beyond belief!,RonNorfolkUK
UR33129232,2009-25-June,This is the lousiest hotel I ever stayed in London! Durty noisy rooms are small you can hardly move when two persons are in it doors are slammings beds are with springs which enter into your body at night bedsheets are durty not talking about the blankets! You can hear your neighboor snooring or can follow his TV programme... Moreover you have to pay after staying 3 nights in the hotel for them to keep your luggages into a safe place! Really the worst of the worst!,MGHBrussels
UR44286395,2009-24-September,I normally stay in small basic budget hotels in Europe and really don't have very high expectations. I am always pretty happy with the standard of the rooms and service. This would have to be the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. The basic attention to detail and care just wasn't there. The fire alarm went off at 3am in the morning and the staff didn't seem at all concerned. I feared for my life.,Fats75
UR43987688,2009-23-September,I travel a lot and I'm not picky when it comes to hotels but this place was probably one of my worst hotel experience. I stayed there in 2 different rooms one facing the front street was small and ok. The second room I stayed was facing the back street bigger but nasty. The carpet and the bed were just so old and scary. I felt itchy the whole night. I'm used to talk on carpet without shoes but there I was scared to walk around without shoes. The bed was just too old and so uncomfortable. Breakfast was the worst compare to all my other stays in Europe just some bread and can fruits. Location wise it's pretty nice very close walk to subway station park and lots of shopping and food around yet it's on a very quiet street.,PrincessSasa
UR43284444,2009-21-September,My daughter and I stayed here for 2 nights. When we first arrived we were handed our key and we went in search of the room which was on a mezzanine level on the first floor. It was a bit grubby and in need of a good clean and the decoration was tatty to say the least but the bathroom was clean and as we were only there for 2 nights decided it would be ok. That was until that night when we got back to the room and got into the twin beds. You could feel every spring in the bed. it was rock hard and smelt fusty and the pillow was flat. I tried unsuccessfully to get comfortable and in the end decided that I would ask for a move to another room. "There were no spare rooms" "there were not staff to move us" "the hotel was full" " try in the morning". These were the reasons we could not have another room. We were given a mattress protector (which smelled fusty) and I asked for 2 more pillows. We were given 1 (thats all they had!!!!!) without a pillow case on and it was stained and smelly. I was told to put it under my existing pillow. I didn't sleep at all and in the morning my back and neck were killing me from the springs in the bed! At reception I was told by the duty manager (who didnt even look up from his paperwork) that they were full and he was unable to help me. This was a blatant lie as the maids were cleaning numerous rooms and large numbers of people were checking out at the time. I eventualy asked again (this time a young lady who was very helpful) if we could be moved and the young lady went to plead our case (thats how it felt) with the duty manager who incidentally didnt come out of the office. After much persuasion on her part he agreed we could have another room on the third floor. So much better - small but clean and with a comfy bed. Without the young lady virtually begging for us to be moved I fear we would have had to stay in the original room as he could clearly be heard by us as he was saying to the girl "just tell them we cant help them - we are full". My daughter has travelled the world and has said that hostel accommodation in some of the countries she has travelled to was better than this hotel. The bed was like sleeping on a bag of rocks and fusty smelling beds are not what I expect in any hotel let alone a british 3 star!! My advice is if you are staying here check your room especially the bed before you part with your cash and dont bother with the breakfast on offer - try one of the many local places serving breakfast.,Becky41
UR49512272,2009-18-November,very outdated hotel good service at desk- very small hot room  very small lift - very narrow halls. cold breakfast- clean food service area. great location to sight see form. A coat of paint and some wallpaper- would do a world of good new bathroom although small.,samsgramboston
UR29904769,2009-13-May,We were in London for six days and this hotel was the only bad thing about the entire trip. We stayed out as late as we can so we won't have to deal much with the hotel room. We stayed on the 4th floor. There are two lifts/elevators one can fit two people with small luggage and the other lift is a lot smaller. We took the stairs most of the time because the lift runs very slow. The elevator carpeting needs to be replaced it was very dirty. The carpeting in the entire floor and rooms need to be replaced as well. We can hear the noise from the hallway and every time someone walked by we can hear the hallway floor creak; the floor in our room creaks as well. The room we were given was very tiny we can barely move about. We had to take turns getting ready in the mornings. There were holes around the light fixture on the ceiling stains on the wall chipped off crown molding and the worse part was the bathroom. We had 20 inch suitcases and had they been bigger we would not have been able to fit both in the room. The bathroom had two bath towels one hung on the shower door and the other was on the floor beside the toilet it was stained yuck! Thankfully we brought our own towels. There was no toilet paper holder the shower didn't drain well and the shower head had 6 holes and there was no way to attach it to the shower head so we had to hold it while showering the worst shower experience ever!!! The only godd thing was we had water pressure. The water leaked through the shower walls and onto the bathroom floor. The door to the bathroom is spring loaded so you can't leave it open because it shuts on its own. There was no air conditioning and one of the windows didn't shut all the way. We would never recommend this hotel to anyone! If you are booking through go-today travel please do not book this hotel. The only good thing is it's close to the Queensway tube stop. One last thing I left the "do not disturb" sign on the door the entire time we were there but on our last day they went in and cleaned the room anyway and took the sign off!!! unbelievable!,HolidayVirginia
UR24507363,2009-12-February,Having booked a short break for a Birthday we were excited to arrive in the big smoke. Needless to say our excitment turned to disgust and disappointment from the moment the taxi stopped outside the hotel. My advice would be to stay well away do not book and definately do not trust their web pages the photos are clearly of some age. The rooms were dirty small with drawer fronts missing and the single wardrobe in a triple room would not even close. There was damp staining to the ceilings and walls mildew to the windows and the bathroom could have kept the most budding scientists busy for weeks. We were offered an alternative in the basement and uncleaned. The bin hadn't even been empied. If I could rate this 0/5 I would. We booked into the Marriot in Maidavale which was beautiful and I would recommend to anyone. Friendly professional and clean with large rooms and comfy beds. PLEASE DO NOT BOOK INTO THIS HOTEL - The Queens Park hotel that is!. I would not leave a rat to die there. They would not refund my first night although there was no way we could stay in this room.,AK01
UR25953682,2009-10-March,I was to stay there from July 21st to July 28th. And I would. Until I found out that someone had broked into mine and other 4 rooms on Saturday afternoon. After a regular stay with no bad or good surprises - the room was tiny and a bit hot but clean enough; the common areas were pretty narrow and in need of refurbishment not to mention the elevators; the breakfast was tedious with much of the same thing and the clerk service limited but would do - I became stupefied when I got back from a typical full tourist day at 11:20 p.m. and found the door unlocked and loose - the rest from this point on would be totally predictable: wood and iron pieces of the door and from the door frame all spread on the carpet my suitcase open an torn (they opened it with a knife or something similar) and all my clothes and personal belongings turned over. I was using the safety box inside the closet (the closet was unlocked but nothing there was touched) but still had 200 euros inside a bag kept in the suitcase but miraculously they did not see it or took it! (they were too busy and had much to do in the room in front of mine: I looked back and found it with the door totally destroyed and detached from its frame (it was laid on the ground!) and they also had other neighbours rooms to break into. On the other hand they took away my watch I was fond of and some money from the German guy beside; he was not using a suitcase locker differently from me (though it was useless). The clerk claimed that they did not take anything else from the others that I was the only one robbed. They were looking for things with presumable value that would fit in a pocket . The hotel has no security at all and since in my week stay there wasnt a single day when someone from the desk asked me where I was going before entering or leaving the hotel. It was very frustrating to see that besides the Portuguese guy on the desk during the night shift who gave the minimal support and called the police the manager was absent and unhelpful since took two days to authorize the 20 pounds refund for the new ordinary suitcase I had to buy and to allow my second night in the hotel in front of the Queens Park they booked me into - he wanted me to come back and stay my last night in London in that total unsafe place which I refused. For my watch I got only more 20 pounds. I talked to three different police officers only the last one was understanding but they were unanimous in saying that nothing else could be done that they had already been there for some poor investigation they did (they wasnt even aware that my room was also burglarized they thought that the thiefs broke into only 3 rooms and took notice that there were 2 more rooms by my fone call). Police added it was becoming frequent in the Bayswater region and that in Brazil would be the same (!). The hotel had no cameras or security system at all; there are two doors separating the elevator hall from the alleys helping any sound to go through. It was very easy for a couple of guys to do what they did: one can be just checking the imminent danger while the other kicks each door he wants close the curtains and do the service. They new sharply the room service schedule: at 1:00 p.m. I was there and so was the maid. The crime happened afterwards. I strongly recommend to keep away from this poor hotel if do not want to count on the "luck" I had in having only one good stolen. I have photos of the incident which I have downloaded to this site. The first and best one with the front view of the smashed door from the enterer's perspective was deleated from the camera by accident but there are still 10 photographs remaining among which even the most sceptics can find sheer evidences of the episode.,Girino1
UR17623457,2008-7-July,Oh my word what a bag of pants Wouldnt let my pet sheep stay here Dont stay here even if your life depends on it! Damp all over the bathroom shower was flooded so I thought I was having a bath 2! Breakfast staff so rude & when I asked about a full English she looked at me funnyQ Room was like a match box! Booked late so was last place with free rooms! Said 4 star but I wouldnt get a 1 off me! Robert & Lucy From wales where the sheep live,w4llaroo
UR13365955,2008-7-February,first room was smalldirty & had water leaking in from room upstairs . got moved to a 2nd room which was better. our friends also had to change room only to have a 300 personal item disappear the next dayfrom his drawer. when the police got involved the item appeared at reception that night ........amazing......wont be back,happyholsScotland
UR15699520,2008-6-May,I saw a few photos of other hotel rooms but I can honestly say that they had nothing to do with my own. Of course we had a private bathroom but that's it! No clean towels no clean sheets no vacuuming and sometimes not even toilet paper... As I first walked into the hotel I saw a mouse in the breakfast room...no wonder why; the vacuum cleaner remained in the hall unused during my whole stay (5 nights).I guess a lot of guests must have seen it long before I did... Our key-cards didn't work most of the times and we had to go down all the way to the lobby to have them reprogrammed. Apart from that lovely neighbourhood two tube stations nearby and Hyde Park of course. If you don't mind packing your own sheets and towels then this hotel is all right I guess..,Beverly_Mars
UR21552910,2008-4-November,We had been warned about how tiny rooms are in Europe so tht was no surprise but that was not the issue here. The bed was horrible with absolutely no padding left between you and the springs. The furniture was more in the way and the layout for the room could be much better at least for the room we stayed in which was in the dungeon-like basement. The walls were super thin so the troop of school children that decided to stay next to us one night kept shutting the doors loudly and came in and out all night long. I wanted to give their chaperon a piece of my mind the next morning. The TV which looked fairly new did not work andn seemed possessed since it would turn on for two seconds and the just turn off. There were also two light bulbs that were out which could have helped light up the cell-like area a bit more. Both these issues were brought to the attention of the staff but nothing was ever done. The bathroom is remodeled but the shower does not close all the way and you get everything wet so watch the really high step and make sure you don't slip on all the water everywhere. The day staff was very nice and tried to help. The night shift was cold and rude so we gave up. Breakfast was very average but we were not visiting London for the food we were saving our stomachs for Paris. Over all the only thing this place has going for it is its proximity to the Tube and interesting array of shops and food about two blocks down. Next time we will spend a little extra money at least for a decent bed so I can be more well rested!,PramPusher
UR15637812,2008-4-May,I've read alot of the reviews and often didn't agree with all the negatives. However i have been compelled to write a review after staying at this hotel as it was really a disgrace. I don't know how they qaulify as a hotel. We booked 4 rooms to stay in for taking part in the london marathon. My girlfriend and i my brother and his wife my mum and dad and my sisterher boyfriend and son. Our room was tiny cupboard only a single size toilet door did not shut shower didn't hang on toilet had a bad smell (Not only after I'd been in it!) decor dated and black marks all over the walls also banged my head off the tv sticking out the wall. My brothers room was pretty much the same siters room was nice though and it had air-con. It was like being in a different hotel. Very nice although they gota cockroach on the last night(3rd night) and mum and dads room was a step up from ours too but still not great. We arrived late at night on the first night so just wanted to get our heads down there and then. When we complained the following afternoon we got nothing but excuses from the smarmy little receptionist guy. Full of it and we were getting nowhere. Like I said i really don't like reading so many bad reviews as there are alot to be said about personal preference/opinion BUT i really wouldn't advice anyone to stay here. pay the extra 20-30 and get somewhere decent. Big thumbs down from everyone in my party...,piperjock
UR12335168,2008-4-January,Booked this hotel for two friends and myself for a special birthday weekend away. We chose the hotel on the basis of the website photos and it's central location. On arrival payment was taken in advance. The room we were shown to was filthy in the basement with little natural light and exceptionally small for a triple room. We complained and were shown two other basement rooms in a similar filthy condition including one onto the street with no curtains on the window and an unsatisfactory fourth floor room. The 'Hotel' is considerably run down from the impression given by the website. The manager declined to refund our money in full (retained the cost of one night for each of us) when we decided not to stay even one night saying we could complain if we liked but it would make no difference as all complaints went to him anyway. We felt quite unsafe. Definitely not a place to stay.,deid
UR19573842,2008-31-August,We stayed 3 people in two rooms but saw 3 rooms. The rooms were very very small in one room the 2 doors couldn't open because of the bed. Worse were the mattresses: it felt like lying on metal wires which was excactly what we did - awfull (the staff told us that all beds were the same). My father asked for a lamp and a chair for some evening reading but was told after asking several times: we don't have chairs in the rooms it is not hotel policy - funny because there was a chair in the other room... The toilet papir stood on the floor and the shower hose was leaking. Our safe didn't work the staff figured it was due to a used up battery but it was never fixed. Breakfast was very uninspiring: two types of marmelade of the cheapest kind no cheese no honey no bacon and eggs just the same boring tree types of bread one type of cereal bad juice milk coffee and tea. Not very friendly either always started removing our plates ect. before we were finished.,TravellingDane007
UR22309712,2008-30-November,After booking the hotel I came across some mostly unfavourable reviews about this hotel. Seeing as there were 5 of us going to London to stay here me my partner child 9 years and 2 parents (60+) I was understandably very concerned for our forthcoming 2 nights stay. Conclusion: Its a budget hotel in a great location to get around London. Cheap n cheerful! Yes it was a bit tatty and in need of some decoration. Yes the staff were mostly foreign but were not rude in our dealings at least. The bedding was clean and not a problem. One morning the hot water was off throughout the hotel could have been a major issue for this review but it was as promised back on for our evening return and what a nice hot shower to have. The breakfast was fine. No bar as mentioned in an earlier review. All in all if you just want somewhere to sleep and leave your bags all for a cheap price.....Then its fine. You dont go to London to sit in your hotel room its a good base. If you want the Ritz then get your money out and pay for it.. So the rooms/elevator are small and it seems a bit 'rough around the edges'. Youre paying a small price to stay there compared to other hotels.. Its OK !!!!,HibboLeeds
UR14559253,2008-26-March,Stay away from this hotel this is probably the best advice you can get. The rooms are very small as are the beds. You have to be very much in love to sleep in the so-called double bed. The bathroom was nice except for no hot water in the morning. Breakfast also is ok if you love toast. Some of the staff are very nice and helpfull but a few of them seems to have studied at Fawlty Towers. The hotels only real asset is its prime location close to the tube busses and restaurants in quuensway but there are lot of better hotels only slightly more expensive in the area.,Zach003
UR20980727,2008-18-October,We stayed at the Queens Park Hotel for one night and to be honest it was one night too many. Our original room the window catch was broken. We were moved to another room but the rooms are tiny and the shower was more of a drip. Certainly no good to wash in. There was major road works going on directly outside the hotel causing a lot of dust and noise but none of this was mentioned when we booked the hotel. The continental breafast was stale cheap bread which you had to toast yourself or tinned fruit. We ended up sitting in the lobby of the hotel eating what little we could stomach as the tiny dining area was full. Not an enjoyable experience and would certainly never go back to this hotel.,sunderlandgirl_8
UR14318397,2008-16-March,By far our worst hotel experience in London: We booked this hotel after seeing pictures and description at the hotel's own website. The room was very small and so was the bed: Actually the bed was so short that I (1m83cm) had to lie diagonal in order to bee there. No duvets were present but one bedsheet and blanket for sharing. Amongst others the hotel webside promised "flat screen LCD television" but it was some 14" old fashion tv with only three channels and no working remote. It also promised a trousers press which were there but it was visibly broken. Bathroom was also very small and toilet cistern was extremely slow to refill. The continental breakfast did not contain what I would call "a selection" of cereals as stated on the hotel website. It contained of cornflakes and one type of oatmeals or the like. None of the promised fruit or juices were present. We were woken several times as the firealarm - according to the staff when we asked about it - went off everytime someone took a cigarette somewhere at the hotel. Hence we ended up in not taking the alarm seriously. Lifts were of very poor quality and actually we trembled out of the lift the first time as it didn't quite reach the level of one of the floors but was missing a few inches. The staff didn't greet when guests were coming or going but seemed rather resigned.,cirlu
UR22786604,2008-16-December,I don't want to write too much as I've wasted enough of my time being in or thinking of this sad excuse for a hotel. I have no idea what star system they work on but 3* to me seemed to be 3 too many. The first room we were put in was small with wall paper peeling off the wall and a damp towel on the bathroom floor. On being moved to a "better" room which had a broken bin no toilet paper and cigarette burns on the net curtains we accepted that we should stay out as long as possible that evening to avoid being in that building. Honestly to think we managed to stay in Hiltons for ~70 a night to get bumped at this dump upset both me and the girlfriend. Save your money for another month before your stay and just stay somewhere nicer. AVOID! PLEASE!,CoachRoberts
UR21842998,2008-14-November,We have booked this hotel after contacting them by email. They gave us the rates per room per night in written and we were surprised to know when we arrived that they expected us to understand rates change according to the receptionist and day of the week. Their excuses were so childish. The rooms were so tiny and dirty no hot water you could not move the photos on their site have nothing to do with reality.Breakfast is awful and they serve it in a dirty small room that could be ideal for their staff. Be very carefull to get written confirmation as they will drive you mad! Never in my life has such a terrible experience.,Petunia1Greece
UR14229258,2008-12-March,-Dingy small room -Shower leaked and sprayed water everywher - toilet seat and garbage broken - carpet had "hills"in it from wear - TV busted - Safe didn't work - Surly aweful staff except for one gentleman (who should be commended -- of black descent) who was exceptional - Charged for services (which was OK) but shorted me on change because believe it or not they didn't have any! - needs complete renovation of halls and (at least) my room I could go on but you get the idea.,Merg_8
UR21745695,2008-11-November,we stayed in this hotel for a weekend. we knew it was a budget hotel before arriving however expected some degree of hygiene and cleanliness. the carpets and curtains were filthy. the wallpaper was peeling away from the walls. this was without doubt the worst expeinence I have ever had in any hotel anywhere in the world. the photos on the website do not represent what is on offer. this is not only my view but that of the other people that accompanied us on our trip. we had three rooms in the hotel for the weekend and all were in the same poor condition -one even has grafitti scrawled on the bedroom walls.,DublinJackeen
UR15879810,2008-10-May,When I arrived at this hotel there was a man complaining about his room already at the reception desk. Then there was a girl complaining. I started to get the picture. I figured it couldn't be that bad though. All I needed was a clean bed for one night. I was given room B107. First off I and my luggage almost didn't fit in the tiny shabby little box of an elevator. It stopped either 6 inches too high or too low for its intended floor before coming to a jolting stop. The "B" in B107 obviously stood for basement. My room was down a series of hallways with bad lighting and stagnant air. I was travelling solo and I did not feel safe down there. I finally found the room and went inside. No no no. The room was dirty and the plumbing leading away from the toilet was a flexible clothes dryer exhaust tube. You know the white plastic tubing that should never be used to carry urine and feces anywhere? Yep that's what they were using for the outflow. I went to the front desk and told him I needed a clean room that was on a floor with other people around. The next room had what appeared to be legal plumbing but it was filthy. There was some sort of grease line on the wall just above the bed. The walls were so dirty with chunks of plaster missing and the ceiling peeling down with mold and water stains. The window only partially closed and the locking mechanism on the door could not be secured. It looked like someone had chisled the wood away *from the inside*. Acckkk! I called Hotwire long distance on my cell to tell them that I absolutely could not stay there and that it shouldn't even be operating with an illegal plumbing system like that. They were very helpful and very apologetic. I ended up in the Thistle around the corner for only $40 more. The difference was night and day. I wouldn't stay in the Queens Park Hotel if they paid me!,AOlzewski
UR10606957,2007-5-November,This Hotel is nothing like their website pretends. It is a cheap tacky and dirty hotel well past its sell by date. One nite in a grubby rubbish room with a bed like a board was the worst 110 I have ever spent. The hotel would be better assigned to vagrants.,FergalPoole
UR10039122,2007-4-October,Queens Park Hotel London 48 Queensborough Terrace Bayswater London A real nightmare.!!! This hotel NEEDS DECORATING. Dirty rooms. Window whoch opened max 6 inches. Bedroom: Thin pillow & very terrible beds hard and very lumpy broken bed. Curtains were so old and dirty. Poor standard and wall paper and borders was peeling off. Beaten up lampshade. Bedrooms are shabby and carpet dampish smell. The bathroom was tiny. Hair dryer broken. The halls were narrow and hard to navigate. Very noisy from early in the morning by staff in reception. Very small breakfast. Cornflakes and soggy toast with jam coffee/tea and juice and fruit cocktail. No cheese or egg. VERY basic Continental Breakfast. No facilities to buy food. Confirmation promised a daily paper - receptionist informed me this has been discontinued for the past three years! Would strongly recommend people do NOT stay there In my experience this is no way a 3-star hotel Hotel a real nightmare. !!! These observations refer to rooms 108 and 120 when we would be moved for the second night. Not value for money at all!!,kris1959
UR11237461,2007-4-December,This hotel charges a lot of money because of its location....but it really is not worth the cost. As past reviewers have noted there is a lot to be wary about and although I found it alright for a short stay I know there are better options out there. The lifts were coffin cramped and slow so I negoiated the badly labelled staircases wandering around steps and floors until I got to my room. The room itself was very good - a bit cramped but I am on my own so it wasn't that bad. The bathroom had not been cleaned that well and it was very small. "Breakfast" really did live up to the name "fast" - the bread/fruit/cereal selection would have been a scandal were it not so laughable. Saying all this I really would not bad mouth the hotel too much - it is great for three tube lines and almost every bus is on the main route into Oxford Street or Westminster. It is a good location for the shopping and pubs outside Queensway station itself.,D0kt0rb
UR6547596,2007-3-January,I can't comment on the rooms or anything at this hotel since having booked it online we were told on arrival that our room had been flooded and they couldn't accomodate us. They booked us into a hotel nearby (which incidentally was pretty aweful). Some friends also booked this hotel and the same thing happened - except a faulty boiler was blamed this time. Strange how often this seems to happen when you read the reviews on trip advisor don't you think? Nuff said!,SYSTIX
UR11132322,2007-29-November,The hotel is dirty from the front door to inside your room. We had to chance rooms three times because the standard was so poor. I wasn't expecting 5 star but was expecting 3 star I would only give it 1. On the bright side the staff are friendly and do try to make things right but you can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear. There are much better hotel's in the same price bracket.,Ty_wales
UR7987109,2007-25-June,My wife and I booked this hotel through Virgin Atlantic Vacations package. The hotel is situated in the Bayswater area on a relative quiet residentilal street. We are familiar with this area as we stayed there many times. Here the acceptability ends. The hotel has not been well maintained at all The owners have carried the idea of "no-fill" and its "budget" rating to the extreme. On entry the guests are greeted with a well worn-out welcoming mat which is an eyesore and then though an always opened paint-peeled door in hideious blue. On entry the lobby has only a few uncomfortable wooden chairs along the wall for those who need to wait for the rooms to be readied or to picked up by shuttle services. There is on another wall a well worn and didlipated and filthy couch which even the Salvation Army would likely refuse While the staff are helpful and courtious but their competence are wanting. Then along the counter there are a few drooping potted plants which would be much better off being discarded.The rooms are small and barely adequate but the carpeting are worn and filthy. Gurests are well advised to bring their own soap as the hotel only provides one or two packets of bath gel and shampoo no facial tissues It's down-right dangerous to ge in or out of the bath tub which is set on different levels to the bathroom floor. The shower head is set so high it take some stretching and reaching to bring it sown. As to the Continenal Breakfast it consists of the basic .(white and wheat sliced breadwith butter and jam rolls two kinds of cold cereals and apple and orange juices. canned fruits coffee and tea. After six days there it becames rather monotonous. Also there's only one chair in the room .If the chair is occupied by wife who needs to make up to get out the spouse would have to sit on the bed.. As our plane was delayed one night due to mechanical problem and the airline called ahead from Orlando to request the cancellation of the first night and extend anther night at the end the hotel doesn't want to recognize this and was on the phone aurguing which is annoying. We don't know what the rate is as it is included in the Virgin Atlantic package. But we definitely will not check in at this hotel again. Travelers are well advised to seek elswhere. It's okay for the very young with tight budgets or travelers from less developed countries. But for others who are looking for a pleasant and relaxing vacation stay clear of this hotel.,SeasonedTraveler8
UR7671405,2007-22-May,I booked this hotel at short notice through Expedia based on the cost and their description. It was truly horrible. The description made the place seem good and mentioned cable TV free newspapers bar/lounge and much more - well it has none of these. The room I had was tatty and disgusting. The main fabric of the hotel could not have been redecorated or refurnished for decades - dirty carpets peeling stained paintwork etc. I can see that if you paid perhaps 20 it might be just about worth it but at 100 definitely not. The DIY breakfast was the only part that was just about OK.,SpineyNorman
UR8607087,2007-2-September,me and my partner booked this hotel from the londonhotelsite.com website after reading it was a 3 star hoteland described as being a 'luxury hotel' with 'comfort' and having 'high standards' and being 'hospitable' these are the most untrue claims that this hotel can make when we first arrived we were given a room on the first floor which we used the 'coffin' like lifts to get to that floor after walking down a dark stinking coridor we finaly got to our room which was the size of a hamster cage ! we told the reception that we could not stay there we were then given another room to look at on the 5th floor me and my partner had to take 2 sepertae journeys in the lift to get the to that floor they are so tiny !! we arrived on the 5th floor which had no lights switched on in the coridors and old used mattress were stored right infront of the lifts we had to find the light switches then we had the same problem the room was not acceptable we told the reception that we want a better room on the ground floor as we dont find the lifts acceptable or even safe. we were given a ground floor room which stunk like urine ! the carpet was dispicableand not even vacuumed properly the wallpaper was hanging off the walls with think green mould caused by damp the radiators were clogged thick with dust and dirt the walls and skirting board were covered in unknown liquid type stains and dust and dirt the trouser press fell away completely from the wall which is unsafe. the bathroom was full of damp and rotten bath panels and the tiles were full of resdue from previous guests taking showers. one morning the cleaner turned up to clean our room carrying a dirty hand held bucket and a dirty brown stained sponge !! not a proffesional cleaning maids trolly insight. despite there own fire safety procedures (which is found on the back of the room door) stateing that every day at 12 noon they will test the fire alarm we stayed there for 3 days and never heard it once....maybe it dosent work at all ??!!...potentially an extreme fire safety hazard ! we were constantly harrassed by the receptionist staff requesting we change the room as they had over booked that room for another guest ! the mattress was completely worn out it was ripped and had the springs sprung most unbeliveably it was covered all over in heavey yellow and brown stains... this hotel is no where near a 3 star !!!! and the comments on there own website are very misleading we have filmed all this evidence. just because the room rate was not as expensive as other hotels it does not mean we have to accept an inferior service or less standards of good housekeeping. my advice would be to stay away completely it is the most unhygienic place i have ever had the misfortune to stay at.,cassey7999
UR11490530,2007-12-December,I read the reviews and decided to take a chance. It was difficult to get three single beds (for three adults) in one room on relatively short notice. Location was great and we did feel safe in our room but that was the best I can say. There was a cigarette burn hole in my bedspread. I tried not to look too closely at my surroundings. I noticed the crude repairs done in the bathroom to repair the broken door and shower curtain rod. The refrigerator was feeble and worthless. But the worst and the real downside was an inability to get a decent rest. The beds were all "broken" and sagged in the middle making restful sleep impossible. We averaged about four hours tops mostly from exhaustion. The room was hot and stuffy with the window closed but the noise from the street was awful with the window open. It sounded like there was a pub across the street and I woke one night to repeated peels of a woman's laughter. Traffic noise I'm used to and still it was bad. The included breakfast was worthless. No fruit either fresh or canned. Mostly breads or dry cereal served with room-temperature milk. And last English did not seem to be the native language of either the staff or most of the guests.,natashabebe
UR10068414,2007-11-October,Stayed here one night on a work trip and would never do so again. The rooms were very tatty and in need of decoration. The floors were uneven and i didn't want to take off my shoes and walk on the carpet. The shower was in barely working order and the TV was worse than useless. Worst thing though was that the fire exit on the fourth floor was mostly blocked by matress and furniture from a room that was being refurbished. We reported this to reception and it was duly noted but remained unchanged when we left the next day. Staff were pleasant and tried to be helpful but they are working with very poor facilities. Lots of foreign tourists were staying and i felt quite ashamed at the standard of accommodation they were being offered for the money!,earlsferrygirl
UR6348080,2006-8-December,Too many things to describe just dont waste your money on this shabby hovel. My daughter & I came away covered in bites.,Christmasangel
UR5773380,2006-6-September,We stayed there in August 2006 and from the outset the advertising and photographs of the hotel are false and misleading. This is just slightly above a basic backpackers lodge. It has no bar as advertised the restaurant if you can call it that does not look anything like the photos and there is no lounge. The only place to sit is next to the Concierge on a battered and broken three seater. The staff were reasonably friendly the rooms totally over rated. They were tiny and cramped our double bed was pushed against a wall that meant my wife had to climb over me to get in and out of bed. No aircondition so we had to have the window open the noise was unbelievable. There is a set of flats/apartments opposite where the young tenants sit on the doorway yelling and talking all night. We cut our stay short and went to a Travelodge - much better and a lot cheaper. The only thing in QP's favour was the location just metres from Hyde Park and Queensgate.,OzzieStu
UR4413602,2006-4-February,Read all the other moaners- what do you expect for this kind of money? What does the room size matter whilst you sleep? Have a couple of drinks afore bedtime and all will be fine. Yes the lift is tiny and slow have a laugh - do the same about the bathroom. If you are over picky about sheets and carpets - then pay 10 times more somewhere else and be happy with that. It's a cracking location for access to this part of London the breakfast is OK just book one night. Perhaps get a bottle of Champagne with the money you have saved and enjoy the day!,boffpa
UR6333579,2006-4-December,This hotel was conveniently located near a Tube stop Kensington gardens several restaurants an Internet cafe and a change bureau. The staff was pleasant as well. However our room and common areas needed new paint and carpeting and the bathroom tile was mismatched and old; finally there was a rat trap near the night stand. The hotel was not the cleanest and the walls were very thin - we could hear everything in the next room. This hotel was tolerable because we stayed only 2 nights. The nightly rate was economical but I would have rather paid a bit more for a nicer place.,Nola70125
UR4832122,2006-3-April,Someone broke in our room while we were sleeping!! We were robbed. They snatched a purse and brief case. I found the brief case in the stair well. The staff was not helpful. It was only at the request of the police that we were able to change rooms. None of the doors have latches. Two good things: Hot water readily available and a good locatiopn to the tube bus and Hyde Park,A TripAdvisor Member
UR6021648,2006-28-October,I wish I could say this was the best hotel I have stayed at but that would not be true. I booked two doubles for two nights and a single for one night on arrival we had to spend first night in basement room for 4 as the two doubles were not available the basement room was supposed to be a superior room but in fact was anything but. Second night had two double rooms one of which was very small upon entering this room I thought it was a single as the bed was so small. Some of the furniture in the rooms we used was falling apart and some of the beds were very lumpy. On arrival at the hotel one lift was out of action the other was exceedingly small. The continental breakfast was not the best meal I have ever had. On the plus side the location was fine for our purposes not to far from queens park underground station. The area was pleasant and close to Hyde Park. At the price we paid for the rooms 55 for a double per night you could say we got what we paid for.,airportblues
UR4523364,2006-27-February,The Queens Park hotel london having read reviews prior to our trip we were pleasantly surprised that our room although small was clean and well laid out. The hotel service was however non existent. The lifts were working prior to check in then mysteriously hand written notes appeared stating both were out of order. The stairs are very steep I was grateful our room was ONLY on the 3rd and not the 5th floor. There appeared to be no visable sign of these being repaired. The complimentary newspaper was unavailable on request as was room service despite being advertised. The breakfast in the foyer looked ok however when we arrived 20 minutes prior to deadline there was an absence of hot drinks and the staff had disappeared. The location of the hotel is superb and to be fair we were hardly in our room at all it was an annoyance that the service was so poor. I would recommend the bayswater area for excellent bars and restaurants do check out the indoor shopping centre great cinema and restaurants on the upper floors. It is a vibrant area and not expensive. As for Queenspark if you are relatively fit and indifferent to the staff give it a goat a discounted rate only.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR4828624,2006-2-April,If you are used to north american hotel standards this is probably not the hotel for you. The decor is pretty trashy and the linens look and feel like they were purchased in the 1970's. There is peeling wallpaper and stained furniture in both the lobby and the hotel rooms themselves. Not the best place I've stayed but not totally repulsive either. Basically you pay for what you get and in this case given the cheap price it's no wonder that it didn't feel like I was staying in a four-star hotel. They rate themselves as being a three-star hotel but do not be fooled by this - it is really more like a glorified one-star hotel to be honest. Stay here if you need to save a buck! Elevator was out of order when we arrived but location can't be beat.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR5480152,2006-18-July,Pictures of the lobby outside and "restaurant" are very misleading. This is definitely a low budget hotel. The restaurant is really only open for breakfast. The staff is no way overly friendly although we did have a very meticulous maid. Our key card failed to let us into our room twice the second time beacuse we were trying to get into our room 5 minutes after check-out time. As we were on the 5th floor and the elevator trip probably takes a minute a floor this was extremely annoying. The shower setup was very strange- there was a ledge between the tub and the wall the shower head was on. There was no remote for the TV and the Channel Up button on the TV which turns it on was missing. The matress was absolutely disgusting. It looked very yellow and old and was very hard. There was an extra blanket undeneath the sheet being used as a matress pad. The location is very nice though- most convenient to the Queensway Tube station (just redone) and Kensington Park. The area seemed very safe even late at night and we didn't have any trouble sleeping through any street noise with our window open all night. I would not stay here again unless I was on a very very tight budget and needed to be in this area of London.,Trcjmatt
UR5957649,2006-15-October,I think the website of this hotel should be updated with proper picture of the lobby reception and rooms etc. It looks nothing like the website - totally misleading to bookers. The hotel is dreadful and would never stay there again. It should be described as a hostel not a hotel..... our family booked in before us and was given a room which can only be described as a prison cell - it had a small window at the top broken furniture and toilet. There was a terrible smell on the stairs leading up to the rooms and on investigating what the smell was we found dogs muck on the stairs. I would never recommend this hotel and will never stay there again - if it is the last hotel in London available - would rather sleep on a park bench! The Hotel should be closed down refurbished and then re-open. I wish I had taken pictures and then made up my own website on the hotel.,Robert26
UR4956061,2006-10-April,I booked this hotel through Hotwire for a very low price. The location is fantastic and is within walking distance to Kensington Gardens Hyde Park and if you're up for a bit of exercise Notting Hill. There's also a lot of shops and restaurants within easy walking distance. However as most of the other reviews state the hotel leaves a lot to be desired. The elevator is ridiculously small- there's barely enough room for one traveler and a suitcase. You literally can't turn around in it and it's very slow. The room was also very very small. I requested a two person room so I was given a very small double bed. There was just enough room for two people to lay side by side without much movement. The bed was like sleeping on sawdust as were the pillows. The restaurant is non existent except for breakfast- apparently you have to make an advance booking and even then it has to be for a party of ten or more which seems a little pointless. The 'business center' is a computer and a chair in the lobby with access to a fax machine and copier if you ask. As the other review stated the bathroom was miniscule. The sink is over the toilet and banging of the knees was a bit of a problem. The service was polite and efficient but not particularly friendly or helpful. Since our stay was for one night only the Queen's Park was tolerable however for longer stays I would definitely not recommend it. Even if you plan to be in your room only to sleep you won't really get a decent rest in these rooms- the beds are frightful and the neighbourhood isn't the quietest. While the price may seem low sometimes it's better to pay a little more to get a decent night's sleep.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3450398,2005-9-May,The bathroom was so small you could sit on the toilet brush your teeth and wash your feet in the tub at the same time. Come to think of it you could actually sit there and take a shower at the same time since there was no shower curtain and the entire room got a soaking. There was no where to open a suitcase unless you wanted to walk on it to get into the bed. Bed...so hard and lumpy we couldn't even relax. And the loud partying from a downstairs nightclub made sleep impossible. Yikes I could go on about the elevator that could only hold one suitcase without a passenger.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3420980,2005-28-April,My fiancee and I stayed at this hotel and I'd have to say its the worst hotel I've ever been in. 1st off the rooms are small. When I say small I mean 100 sq.ft. if you are lucky. Then throw in a bed (might as well be a block of wood) the dresser your luggage and soon after you check in you'll be looking for a new hotel. Just trust myself and many others do not waste your money or time or ruin a good vacation with a crappy room from this hotel. Ohh yeah did I mention the elevator that is only big enough for 1 person (2 if your super skinny) at one time? But if you do decide to not heed this warning just print out my review and take it with you. Put it in the section of your travel-book titled (London Hotels). I want to make sure you read my review when you go looking for a new hotel. Not to make the review all negative I will say at least the hotel is only a short walk from a Tube Stop.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3390337,2005-20-April,This is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. Room very small and dirty. Bathroom likewise had to close door to be able to turn roound. Bed and bedding very poor matress very old with protruding springs . "Continental Breakfast was appallling. We were met by surly staff cornflakes or crispies rolls or cold croissants and tinned fruit. No cheese meat eggs or toast. Luckily we were only staying one night as an Englishman I felt like apologising to the overseas guests. Rack rate 150 per night how can they justify this. I was lucky I booked through laterooms so "only" paid 50.,A TripAdvisor Member
