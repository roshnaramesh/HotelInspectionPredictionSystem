UR129671603,2012-9-May,I spent a weekend at ths hotel two months ago. The rooms are spacious and the staff is very helpful and friendly. However we did find bed bugs in our beds and on the walls. I went downstairs to the front desk and informed the lady at the counter that we had bed bugs and that I wanted a full refund. Not one person from the staff went to our room to check if there were actual bed bugs. When we told the lady at the front desk she did not question us or even ask surprised. It seemed like a normal complaint from guests. I was granted a full refund. At the 11:00pm we had to leave our room and go search for a hotel with vacancies. The management at this hotel should be ashamed of themselves. How can you 'testify' that you have no bed bugs when you did not even check our room? Do yourself a favor and avoid this hotel at all costs.,Michael L
UR133897524,2012-9-July,Here for a few days on the boardwalk with my three kids. Rented a suite for some space but primarily for the kitchenette. 2 king beds with very worn and substandard linens. Almost felt dirty. No blankets. Fridge was inoperative. When I asked about a replacement fridge the desk attendants response was "were full so there is no room from which to take one from". I had to put everything back in the cooler and ice it down overnight. Place is substandard. Not worth the price. Not worth any price.,popovsky
UR122749540,2012-8-January,My husband myself and daughter have been staying at Tideland for the past four years. The first year we loved it but yes it has become very run down. I am considering going back again but after reading some reviews I'm not so sure. We usually stay in an oceanfront room right over Dunk in Donuts. We love to wake up to the view of the water while drinking coffee. The bed is very sunken in old and squeaky. The ice machines never work so we accepted three years ago we would be buying ice every day. Whatever. The location is perfect that's what brings us back. We never had a problem with pool chairs but have never stayed on the weekend. The pool and grill keep us coamong back to. The girl that worked there worked her but off and remembered us every day. Tidelands does not want to lose her!!! They should however lower the prices or do an upgrade. The place is going down fast which is a shame because of the location and potential. Oh and the staff os so unattentive!!! Rude and uncaring. And that's four years of going there!!,jcheskay
UR136493385,2012-7-August,Pro: good location nice hotel Cons:  Hidden Fee: $8.75/night for hospital fee  Freezer: Too small  Condition of Room: Sand covered floor  Fire Alarm: Uncontrollable On the last day that we were at the hotel the fire alarm went off while I was cooking breakfast for my family. It was about 7am. The night shift receptionist called us twice to ask us about the fire alarm. We did as she told us by opening the door to the hallway opening the door to the balcony and by fanning the fire alarm. After a while the smoke was gone but the fire alarm was still on. It was extremely loud and our ears were hurt. We grabbed our belongings as quickly as possible so that we could get out of the hotel as soon as possible. The receptionist came to our room but she couldnt do anything. Before she left she told us that she was going to call somebody to fix it. I dont know if she ever called anybody but when I checked out at 8:30am she was gone for the day. I complained about the noisy fire alarm to the day shift staff so they sent somebody to our room to take a look. Except that was when we left never to come back there again. The sad thing was that it was my birthday and I was very upset. My day was ruined by the uncontrollable fire alarm and the receptionist that didnt care enough about the hotels customers.,Toyen P
UR133646065,2012-6-July,This was the worst hotel we have ever stayed in. Our ocean front room was large but run down. The sink in the bathroom was falling off the wall. The vent fan did not work and only 2 lightbulbs worked on an old rusty light fixture. The sliding glass door took two people to open. There were holes in the walls and wires hanging from where smoke detectors should have been. Blinds had layers of dust and the bedspreads had burn holes(in a non-smoking room). The elevator was extremely slow and dirty. The hallways had no a/c and carpet was filthy. It took 3 days for someone to fix the safe in our room. No one ever came to address the other issues dispite multiple phone calls and visits to the front desk. We just got excuses about how busy they were and that there were other more important issues they needed to deal with.Simply put they were rude. Also pool/bar was open to the public. It was not a relaxing atmosphere. Wanted to leave and stay anywhere else but could not afford to lose that much money. We were not happy could not wait to leave and will never go back.,Laura S
UR133512932,2012-5-July,We go to OC every other year. We have young teenagers now and were looking for more space but yet still together. Sounded perfect - but sounding and is are 2 different things. First the couch had stains on it (hoping from suntan lotion) - I put a blanket from my car on it! It was gross! Went for some ice - well 5th floor broken 4th floor broken - asked front desk - said 3rd floor is working. But guess what - it's a vending machine for ice - needed quarters. But at the pool bar you could get a bag of ice for $1. Think the front desk could have told me that! Still they advertice ice machines. And they advertise free internet -- NOT TRUE -- it's in your "hospitality" cost of $9 per day for internet (which didn't always work). Beds were awful and the housekeeping was really bad. They took our dirty towels and didn't give us any new ones. When we asked the front desk for new towels they sent up housekeeping who didn't knock and came right in! Good thing we were all decent but really! The pool bar was open to the public and was standing room only in the pool. My kids hated it! The roof top pool - sounds good but on a windy day - cold and had to watch your things from blowing away! Other than the location this has nothing going for it. The front desk people were rude and only time they talked to us - was when they thought we were a family who hadn't checked out on time... When I called them to help with directions to the fishing center they had to call me back... ever where I turned it was awful! If I could have checked out and gone somewhere else I would have but it was too much money to burn away. I will never go there again and will tell all I know that it's not worth it... Only thing we had going was "great weather" which the TIdelands weren't in control off. Good thing or that would have been horrible as well!,SPFamily4
UR129368286,2012-4-May,this hotel has a great location on ocean city MD boardwalk but that is all i can say about our stay this time. the people that stayed there were very roude and loud all nite and i am talking all nite. 8:00 pm uitil 3:30 am. told the front desk three different nites about the noise and they did nothing. the made left our door open three times also. front desk again did nothing. we really did like the hotel in years past but we have changed ore minds on this stay. just a helpful though.,fordman02
UR135803209,2012-30-July,Best advise if you have a reservation take advantage of your cancellation policy. This was the 5th year we stayed at the Tidelands and it is our last. Hotel should be torn down nothing works including the staff and management. We stayed in the two room suits practically nothing in the room worked including the sliding glass doors(however they did leak during the rain storm) the lights the safe the bathroom door. Water pressure so bad you couldn't even get the shampoo out of your hair. The dirtiest room I ever stayed in.!! Everything was covered in dirt the walls and lamp shades had stains on them that had been there for months. No towels no toilet paper no soap they had a coffee maker in the room that I wouldn't let my dog drink from. Two king size (Badddd beds) with three of the smallest pillows I ever saw. The sheets are so gray you would think they suppose to b that color . The so called cleaning staff came in daily and did nothing but placed some towels in the bathroom BUT NO TOILET PAPERthe tub and toilet seat looked like someone had taken a hammer to them. Reported the problem of the safe not working three hours later someone came to the door worked on it for 1 hr and said he could not fix it and left never returned. There was so much dirt around floor of the bed frames and bathroom fixtures you could tell they were not cleaned in a year. NO MANAGEMENT EVER AVAILABLE TO RETURN A CALL ON YOUR ISSUES. IT IS CLEAR THEY ONLY WANT TO CHARGE YOUR CARD AND THEN IGNORE THEIR GUESTS. STAY FAR FAR AWAY FROM THIS HOTEL.,wicked62
UR139310682,2012-3-September,My wife and I chose this Hotel because it was on the Boardwalk had a good pool and looked ok in the photo's. This hotel was not all bad however it was not a great hotel by any means. -The Good - Great location to beach and Boardwalk- You can't beat staying on the Boardwalk in my opinion unless your are looking to keep things very quiet. - The hotel had two pools one on the roof and one on the 2nd floor. The 2nd floor Pool had a nice Bar and Grill The Blue Fin - Very friendly service. The Balcony was nice and big and gave us room for our Beach Chairs and their own patio chairs. - The Bad - The Room did have a musty smell to it especially when the A/C was on. The cleaning service not so great. We had to request new towels even though they took our dirty towels. I was also annoyed because the second night I had spilled drinks all over the and bed we had in our room including the sheets. The sheets were soaked yet the cleaning crew just made the bed and left the wet sheets on the bed. I guess my fault as I should have asked for new sheets but I had figured common sense would prevail. The room was old and the fridge did Ice over but that was because the people before me had it on MAX. The bed was not all that comfortable. The room did not have enough pillows. Also on our first night at the hotel the fire alarm went off at 2:30 AM with no explanation as to why. -My overall opinion is that for the money the hotel was not the best option however I do think that a bunch of 20 something kids would be able to deal with this place without any issue. If your looking for a full resort experience then staying at another hotel may be your best decision. If you're in town for a few days don't plan on doing anything in the room other then sleeping and don't care about the little things then this is a good place to stay.,Rich S
UR132997925,2012-28-June,Just got back from OC first time there is years for me first time for my kids. We arrived and hour early and were delighted to find that our room was ready that is where the delight ended. Parking was terrible!!! We stayed in a suite and it was hard to tell were to check-in since there are 2 front desks one for the suites and one for the main hotel. Location was good on the boardwalk I have to give them that much. Our room keys malfunctioned not once or twice but 5 times in 4 nights!!!! Really annoying to have to continue to go to the front desk for new ones and not even an apology from the front desk!!! Had a kitchenette which had some plates silverware and what not...that was nice at least I thought until I grabbed a plate that was dirty then an other then another....everything in the cupboard was greasy and dirty like they were used by the last guests. I have no problem cleaning then myself while I am there but I do expect them to be cleaned between guests!! We were on the third floor and I tried to use the stairwell....could not open the door on the second floor and when I got to the first floor I found to mattresses blocking the hall...this is also the fire exit!!!! How safe is that??? The stairwell also smelled like someone had been using it as a bathroom. I don't think that house keeping understands what a vacuum is I get it I am at the beach but sand on the floor the minute I get there!!! Plus my girls took off their shoes and you should have seen how dirty their feet were!!! Also for a hotel that bragged about just remodeling they should really clean up the mold in the bathroom.,Rebelslady
UR129006299,2012-28-April,We got there early and were able to check in early. The front desk girls were great. They were sweet and very quick. While I was checking in a lady who informed me she was the owner handed me a paper to fill out on this website about what I liked about the hotel.I won't say her name but it starts with an "A" BEWARE! When we finally got to the room the room was not clean - mold and dust and dirt everywhere but we called to the front desk and the housekeeper came up and scrubbed the floor for us and around the tub. Although this shouldn't have to happen since the rooms should already be clean we didn't complain since she worked her butt off. The hot water never got hot. The AC didn't work. Never did the heat. We asked for a blanket but of course they were out of those as well. I later went down to the lobby to sit and wait on my husband. They at least have a nice tv and couch to sit on. I proceeded to listen to the owner scold one of the girls at the front desk for not making a sale. I mean really? I work in customer service so I know how it is. You can't make someone buy a room they don't want. It was very unprofessional of the owner to treat her in that manner AT ALL but especially in front of guests staying in the hotel. You can definitely tell the only thing she is there for is to claim her money. Those poor workers definitely have a boss from hell!! The location is perfect It's close to everything. Boardwalk is great. Love the beach. I would love to give a good review about this hotel but there isn't much to say. I wouldn't give another cent to this hotel for that rude woman to spend on her 50000 car! HA,matthewsmitty
UR132921150,2012-27-June,We have been to OC a million times and I we will not be returning to this hotel. First I found dried blood on the cover of my bed that was not mine our floor had sand on it when we arrived the ac vent was covered with dust and dirtthe bath tub was too dirty to give our son a bath in. My husband found 2 mattresses in the stairwell along with trash and a very bad smell of urine. You can hear everything from the hallway which made it hard to sleep.Good luck with parking if you move you will have to park to blocks away. The list goes on and on. The only thing that was decent was the view and location we were able to see the fireworks on Tuesday from our balcony. I would not recommend this place to anyone.,momtojakob
UR135538311,2012-27-July,After staying at the resort for only 3 nights i have a long list of things wrong. During check in i was told first that i did not have a reservation then that we were already checked in and have room keys and parking pass when in reality we had just gotten there. So i had to fight to get my room keys and my parking pass. Then when parking they do not have enough parking within the lot at the hotel for us to park so we were told to go across the street and wed be fine. Ended up getting a parking ticket and was told that its not their problem. Then when walking into the room the floor was so sticky i couldnt walk with my shoes on because they had almost broken our safe was already locked and we couldnt use it there were ants in the bathroom and there was a fake nail in the side table in the bedroom. The Air conditioner was not allowed to be under 70 because it would freeze the wifi was very difficult to hook up to the pools were very tiny and the pool bar was very expensive at over $8 a drink. The housekeeping staff knocked on the door at 930 in the morning and woke us all up. After not answering after the first knock she continued to knock until someone answered. We had a towel stolen off the balcony the ice cube maker would not work properly and the walls had something dried on them. Finally the most important thing of was was that the staff could not be bothered. We had 6 people so we needed to use the pull out couch when we went to ask for sheets and pillows we were first told they didnt have any and then we had them thrown at us. When going down to the front desk after 11 we had to call for assistance whenever we called we were screamed at on the phone and told they'd be in whenever theyre done. We had to ask more than once every time we needed more towels or blankets. Then after getting a ticket for parking we went to the front desk to talk with the manager and he dipped and dodged us over 6 times and never got back to us. Worst experience i have ever had in a hotel and i will not be back.,Sara C
UR138593342,2012-27-August,After my son had bed bugs in his room over Memorial Day Weekend I decided not to stay there for Bike Week. Three weeks ago today I cancelled by reservations. I had put $500 down on my room back in March 2012 and they told me if I cancelled it would cost 10% of one night's stay. When I cancelled on AUGUST 6th 2012 they told me it would be 10% if my deposit which would be $50.00. Right there I knew I would have trouble getting anything back from these people. To date - they have not sent me a check. They told me that their policy was that a check would be issued within 5 days of cancellation. They promptly cashed my check in March. I have called for my refund numerous times. They tell me a woman comes in until 9 am and she is the only one that can issue checks. They did not know her name. I have left numerous messages for the Manager who has yet to call me back. Now it has been 3 weeks and no check. Now I have to hire an attorney to try and get my deposit back. So people I'm telling you - besides the fact that they DO HAVE BED BUGS they will also rip you off. They did move my son to some apartment down the street when he caught and brought the Bed Bugs to the front desk. They gave him absolutely no compensation otherwise. DO NOT STAY AT THIS BUG INFESTED crooked hotel. Patti Reilly Gaithersburg MD,Patt R
UR128947387,2012-27-April,My room was horrible. The mattresses are so bad it would of benefited more to go sleep on the beach. The website says the hotel was recently updated what a LIE!! The only good things are the staff was very friendly and helpful. I booked my room with Trista and she gave me a great discount. She was extremely informative and easy to talk too. I also called back to extend my stay and I talked to Latoya I believe was her name. She was very helpful as well. Also the location is perfect. But if you're looking for a clean comfortable room don't go here. For a hotel that is so pricey in the summer you'd think they would have better beds you know?,Gobigorgohome90
UR132834079,2012-26-June,Seriously read the reviews. That is EXACTLY what the hotel representative told us on the phone when we cancelled our reservation. The service and their response to the reviews alone on this website should be an indicator of the quality of this hotel. Thank you Tripadvisor and fellow contributors. I am sad to say that out of all of the great places I have visited and not left an amazing review the way in which we were treated from this hotel has compelled me to write this and to warn other people of our experience. Here is a little back story of our experience. I will disclose 100% we did not even get to the point of staying at this hotel. We were very excited to find such a great deal to book a hotel on the boardwalk on the beach the week following Labor Day. I grew up in Maryland and now live out West and I was very excited to get back and vacation in Ocean City. My mother went ahead and found this great deal and looked at the hotels website and it looked nice! She went ahead and booked the room. After further research and vacation planning we found all of the Tripadvisor reviews and I became very hesitant about staying at this hotel. I trust Tripadvisor as well as the opinion of fellow travelers. This was going to be our first time traveling with our 15 month old and staying at a hotel and the mere thought of bed bugs ants and mold scared me a lot. So... after lots of deliberation we decided to cancel our reservation and find a different hotel. We are all aware of their cancellation fee and my husband decided to call and speak with someone being that it is June and the reservation was not until September. With the more than adequate amount of time between cancellation and the actual reservation we were hoping there would be forgiveness with this fee. But there wasn't and we are happy to pay them money to NOT stay at their establishment. Here is a recap of my husband's conversation with a very rude representative of the hotel when he called to cancel the reservation: My husband called and told the representative who answered the phone that we were cancelling the reservation due to horrible reviews on Tripadvisor and brought it up to her that we were cancelling early enough that we probably should not not have to pay the cancellation fee (10% of your deposit). The representative told him that it was their policy to charge the fee. My husband then asked her is she had seen the Tripadvisor reviews and then proceeded to tell the very rude representative that it was OUR Family's POLICY not to stay in bug infested rooms. Her response was " YOU SHOULD HAVE CHECKED TRIPADVISOR BEFORE YOU BOOKED." Are you kidding me? This is the response a representative told us. Makes us think these reviews are 100% accurate listen to what this hotel representative is telling you. CHECK & READ THEM. We let them know that we would be putting a comment on Tripadvisor for them regarding their quality of customer service. My husband then told the representative to go ahead and keep that $16 (thankfully it was that little) & that it was worth every penny since it means we were not staying there. He let her know that we were SOOOO glad to find out the quality of service they provide PRIOR to the stay. My husband concluded the conversation and told her thanks for the fantastic customer service & hope she enjoys working in a bug infested 'crap hole' of a hotel. Yes a little rude on our behalf however you too would get frustrated with the situation. Educate yourself and look around before booking. There are LOTS of options in OC MD.,CML_1982
UR138426966,2012-26-August,For a high priced beach front hotel it's reasonable to have high expectations. Immediately you will be underwhelmed by the room and its dated appearance. The beds were uncomfortable and in the 3 days we stayed there the maid never cleaned the room once. I would have to call down to the front desk to get our bathroom supplies restocked after returning to a dirty room. The real kicker was charging for the use of the ice machine ($0.25). It's not the price but principal. With taxes and fees the place averaged a cost of $250 a night and that doesn't include ice? Don't bother reporting it to the robotic staff. When I checked out I was not even asked how my stay was or thanked for my business. I did not see any bed bugs in my room but I did read that other reviewers on tripadvisor recently who experienced that problem. After my stay there and my interactions with the staff I can't say that would surprise me at all. Stay away from this place! I don't consider myself someone with high standards when it comes to hotels but I think a clean room clean towels and friendly staff would fall into everyone's standards for a $200+ per night hotel. The Tidelands Caribbean fails in every one of these respects.,Allan G
UR132754224,2012-25-June,We had no AC during the entire time - 3 seperate calls and it still would not work nor would they move us to a different room. When I asked for a fan they tried telling me no. At about 11:30 pm the front desk called to tell me they have a fan for us. When it got there it had so much dust on it - I had to run it in a different direction. The elevator needs to be seriously looked at - it gave a few extra shakes - we started taking the stairs to be safe. Don't waste your money!!!! It was the worst 3 nights ever!!!,799Nonya
UR135383326,2012-25-July,What a s&$thole of a place! Staff is rude always on the phone never want to deal with you. I had to park 3 blocks away in their overflow lot at 8pm and carry my kid across a major roadway. Rooms suck! I wish I could show you pictures! Mold bathroom piglet didn't work and after the maid cleaned our room no toilet paper! You can't make this crap up! I swear it's a DUMP! Stay away!! Lower pool is open to the public because it has a bar try getting a seat at your hotel pool!! We had to leave the pool area or go to the other buildings roof pool. Please save your time money and patience. Do not stay here. I almost want to leave my email here so I can fully explain how bad this place was!,chris1gina
UR130531881,2012-24-May,My husband and I recently stayed at this property for Cruisin' OC weekend (May 18-20 2012). We booked 2 rooms as we were traveling with another couple. The first problem was that we had no hot water for 4 hours from the time we checked in. My friend called 3 times before we were actually told that it was being fixed. The first 2 calls were answered with "ok thank you". What kind of a response is that? The second problem were the safes in both rooms. Neither of them worked. When we called the front desk on Saturday morning we were told that there was not enough staff to allow them to leave the desk to reset them. This is a huge event weekend and you would think that there would be plenty of staff scheduled. Not to mention that we were being charged $8.75 for use of the safe. So I ended up having to carry my valuables with me for the entire car show weekend. The third problem: our friends had ants in the room by Saturday afternoon. And not just a few. They had to throw food away because ants were crawling in everything. The fourth problem: you have to pay for ice! I am a travel agent and have stayed in hotels all over the world. I have never paid for ice!!! That is just ridiculous! We paid $217.60 per night to stay here. The bathrooms are the equivalent of a Motel 6. There is mildew missing grout and very little water pressure. For a few more dollars per night I can stay in Jamaica at an all-inclusive. This was our third stay here over the course of approximately 6 years. I had no complaints during our first stay. I did notice decline in the property during the second stay. But I believe in always giving more than one chance. After this last stay I can say that we will never return. The worst part is that I contacted the resort via info@tidelandscaribbean.com and requested the general manager's name and contact information. I explained in my email that I am a travel agent and that I specialize in group trips. I sent that email on Monday morning. This is Thursday and I have not received any response. The customer service at this property is extremely lacking. The location is excellent for event weekends but that is the only positive. Oh and make sure you check-in as soon as they allow. The overflow parking lot is quite a walk. This hotel is definitely not worth the price they charge.,beachbug69
UR137996803,2012-22-August,The customer service at Tidelands was the worst I have ever experienced at a hotel. The front desk staff including the manager was very rude and unaccomodating. When finally confronted about the poor customer service the night manager was very unapologetic and appeared annoyed to even have to deal with customers! Very frustrating as a paying customer especially when the nightly rates to stay at this dump were close to $300/night! What a waste. The room was dirty the bathtub would not drain and the housekeeping never left clean towels (we had to call every day and request them!!!). The pillows and sheets on the bed were deflated and worn. Yuk! The uncleanliness of this hotel would explain why they now have a bed bug infestation. This would also explain why there was a pest control truck there the day of our arrival!!!! We were also awoken several times during the night due to loud and unruly guests. No good all the way around.,BreezeOtheSea
UR132439427,2012-21-June,I only stayed in this hotel for one night - THANK GOODNESS! First the room we paid for was advertised as "bay view" which it definitely was not. We were on the second floor and had a great view... of the street. If we had paid for "street view" I wouldn't have cared but come on! Perhaps the people on the fifth floor were luckier. Our room was dirty the door didn't lock our toilet ran the walls were paper thin (which between the rowdy neighbors and traffic made it impossible to sleep) and the room smelled like old garbage when we first arrived. The ONLY good thing about this hotel is the location. Do yourself a favor and book somewhere else. Yuck.,Kim J
UR126254044,2012-17-March,Loved the location and size of room. Cleaning staff was very polite. Discovered LOTS of bedbugs on our second night. Check before you sleep.,Alexmack24
UR134553748,2012-16-July,I am only giving a one star because I can not give 0. We just stayed there over the 4th of July weekend. My kids are traumatized by the elevators. It would jolt and then make an awful noise. Our room was fly infested. We kept calling the front desk for assistance. We would kill one then five would come out of the vents. I called six times to speak to the GM paul. I left messages and he never returned my calls. If that wasn't enough housekeeping knocked on our door with a previous patron stating that she left her android in our room. He asked if she could look around our belongings to see if it was still there. The room was vacant for hours prior to our arrival. This matter could have been handled without involving us. starting with the housekeeper that cleaned the room. SOOOO unprofessional. Only stay here if you want your vacation to SUCK!!!! Lesson Learned!!,LHealthpro
UR134475637,2012-15-July,We recently stayed at the Tidelands - 6thru15th. I was very disappointed. We had stayed here many years ago and it was wonderful. For what I paid I expected so much more. Room was dirty. Beds were sunken in. Pillows sheets and bed spreads were stayed and smelled of B.O. The maid was rude and never took our garbage unless I asked her too. I could not believe the attitude se would give when I asked her to sweep the tile floor because of the sand that gets tracked in the room or when I asked for another roll of TP. We never had wash rags or dish towels - she would say everyday she was out of them. Strange we were the first room of the day for her. I know this because at 7am everyday she would beat on my door yelling house keeping. I read other reviews before we went and decided I would judge it for myself. I should have listened to the other reviewers - they were not lying. This place was horrible. Did I mention the burners on the stove did not work fridge was warm tv's had terrible reception- picture was dark and most channels did not come in. Which was not fun when it was raining and you have kids with you. Elevators were slow and smelled. Restaurant was expensive and not that great... The list goes on and on... For being in a non smoking room it smelled of cigarettes all the time because everyone around us were smoking on their balconies. I am so disappointed in the Tidelands. Will not go back.,ckatz_15116
UR134370881,2012-14-July,The only reason this hotel gets a single star is that the review will not accept a zero star rating. Our family rented 4 rooms for 3 days June 30th till July 3rd. This is the worst hotel I have stayed in in my life. We had problems getting into our rooms which had been reserved 4 months earlier. After getting our rooms we found mold surrounding the bathtubs huge holes in the towels and washclothes drywall was falling off the walls the floors were covered in sand and very poor service. I will never be staying in this place again and would highly reccommend that you avoid this hotel. We spoke with the manager at the facility and have been awaiting a return phone call for nearly three weeks. I am attaching photos.,Terry B
UR137209635,2012-14-August,OMG!!!! Where do I start? Just returned home from a 4 day stay at the tidelands!!! Think my family and I should call CDC on this place.. We were on the 3rd floor facing hooters which kept us entertained all night between fighting and arrests etc.. Our first night was ok didn't care for the bathroom considering I spent an hour scrubbing it cuz it was GROSS! Housekeeping comes at 9 and if u asked them to come back they tell u they can't. Second night I pulled out the sofa bed for my daughter and niece and WOW!!!! BED BUGSSSSSS!!!!!! I inspected the whole room and noticed our two beds had brand new mattresses and protective covering which suggested to me that they had a problem prior to August 2012! Went down to the front desk to complain and they were not surprised but didn't care either! We spent the next 3 nights sleeping 3 in a bed. Which because of the protective covering none of us were bitten..every morning we would put our dirty towels in hallway and call up for more and would grab our own toilet paper off the cart. Room was dirty mold in shower bathroom smelled like urine and went out to get my own Clorox wipes and air freshened and Lysol. To end the vacation my niece and daughter came home I'll with high fevers and aches and pains!!!! I should have went with my instincts and listened to the reviews.. I think the good reviews which are very few ; I think they are written by made up people close to this establishment!!!! Save your money and listen to reviews ... We as AMERICANS work to hard to have our money wasted like that. Hated going back to the room at night. I would rather cut off my eye lids and stare at the sun!!!!!! T.L.G. Pocono Pa.,Tracey G
UR140004185,2012-11-September,I have to say we did read some of the reviews but were willing to give this hotel a chance. I can honestly say we will never be staying here again. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. The best part was being on the boardwalk. Toaster did not work only one burner worked on the stove the skirting on the bed & the drapes had stains all over them. Area where you can hang your clothes had stains/ mold on wall.. I have to say a total general cleaning of this hotel needs to be done. Just walking into the hotel stains on the walls.. dirty trim all it would take is a good cleaning & painting and this hotel would be fine. Very dissapointed. Luckly we did not experience the bed bugs as I have heard now.. but honestly not a good place to stay.. do not waster your money.,Toni M
UR131713003,2012-10-June,Bedbugs in our first room then they switched us to another room seemed to be okay. They never came to clean our room or make the beds the whole 3 nights we were there. We had to ask for clean towels and toilet paper when we saw the maid in the hallway. And we asked her if she can come and make our beds and she said yes and never came to do it. I have never been to a hotel that has never made a bed or came into freshen everything up. Just Terrible. Would not recommend this hotel to anybody!!!,Cack30
UR139060354,2012-1-September,Below is an email sent to tidelands that included pictures we have yet to be contacted by anyone. Our stay at the Tidelands Caribbean Hotel was much less than stellar. We arrived at the property on 8/26/2012 and will depart on 8/30/2012. We decided on this particular hotel because we're Travel Agents and occasionally we get requests from clients wish to be recommended to a few of the smaller hotels that don't carry a big well-known name.  Upon arrival we stated that we were Travel Agents which was also stated on our reservation. On our way to the room we immediately noticed certain things that we felt should have addressed. As we exited the elevator on the 4th floor there was a terrible smell that greeted us. It smelled possibly of mold very musty and it carried throughout the entire 4th floor. The carpet was well-vacuumed but it was wet in some places. This could have been from guests tracking water up from the pool which was located on the 2nd floor but interestingly none of the other floors had that smell. When we entered the suite we noticed that the lampshades were stained had what appeared to be mold on them and had what appeared to be strands of human hair on one of them (there were a total of 5 lamps in the suite) we have included pictures. Also there were no face-plates covering the electrical outlets in the room with the balcony. The floors in the suite weren't sticky or spotty but they definitely were grimy! Walking barefoot on them before our trip to the beach netted an unwanted amount of sand and grit. Room service was non-existent and expressing our concerns to the front desk was met with silence and long faces. At one point one of the ladies at the font desk told an older gentleman who was in training that he can "expect to get a lot of complaints about room cleaning". Of course we expressed our concerns to the front desk and asked to speak to the manager. We were told he wasn't available. We left our business cards and asked that he call us in the morning (the morning of day 2). We received no such call. This room cleaning issue was a constant so we questioned the front desk for the manager again. We were immediately told that he wasn't there at the time. We then questioned the front desk attendants as to the room cleaning policy for the hotel. We figured maybe the policy was such that one would have to REQUEST their room to be cleaned otherwise it wouldn't be. It was at this point the she walked away from us entered the back room for about 15 seconds came right back out with the manager. The manager Paul Kahn was calm and attentive. Interestingly he denied ever getting our request for him to call us and said he never received our business cards. He did make a call to housekeeping to inquire about what happened had someone go clean our room immediately and asked for another business card. However we met with the same thing again the next day. The bright spot by far was The BlueFin Restaurant/Bar!! They were amazing. Very attentive with a smile drinks and food were great  they were able to recommend certain items on the menu and they even came out to service the guest while out at the pool! Kudos to them!!  Very dissatisfied and unhappy. A waste of money. Unfortuanatly will not be recommending to our clients and would like some feedback from property owner.,Supermami5
UR115840315,2011-27-July,Did not enjoy our stay because of the very poor service.Stayed for 3 days and had to beg for clean towels every day.Maid never emptied trash cans.Complained about making the beds.Had to have the card keys reprogrammed several times because they wouldn't open the door after we went out and came back to the room.Ice machine was broken.Had to go to the lobby for ice.Floor was filthy(no carpet....tile floor).Will never return.,Tom1945
UR115775401,2011-25-July,Great location and thats about it! Room/bathroom was dirty when we got there and never got any better. Had to asks for towels and ice only at the front desk. Staff ok but not worth the money if you go don't book an ocean front not worth it. Both pool area were so dirty even my kids didn't want to swim there very small too. To many other choices.,HBel1225
UR117188649,2011-24-August,Got a two room suite for $275 a night. Walked into the room light switch wasn't working and room smelled like smoke. Told the front desk they said 'the lamps may be unplugged' (what??) and 'it's a non smoking floor' like I was lying to them or something. So they switched my room and that one smelled worse and lights did not go on there either! Floor was tile throughout which did not give the room a cozy feel at all. I immediately went down to the desk and got a full refund. Could not (nor would not) stay there. Disgusting and WAY overpriced. Would not recommend to ANYONE.,Thomas J
UR117146934,2011-23-August,Don't be fooled by the attractive photo of the pool etc. If you haven't paid absolute top dollar for an ocean view suite you have paid a lot of money to be in a not very well maintained room down a musty hall with a view of the equally cheesy hotel across the street. (The sink in our room was held up by a 2x6 board.) I'd advise anyone curious about the OC boardwalk scene to stay somewhere else -- the further north you go toward Rehoboth the better -- and come visit for one night only.,J W
UR118384876,2011-20-September,Let me start by saying I'm from the Jersey Shore all my life and worked as a chambermaid through highschool in some of the rattiest motels in Seaside Heights. That being said this place was by far the dirtiest rundown smelliest uncared for motel I've ever been in. I'm not some yuppie who expects a 5 start room for a 1 star price but jeez this place was bad. The housekeeping staff were very nice but didn't do a great job. The front desk staff was unfriendly and the whole place just had an air of mismanagement. Too bad place could be great it's right on the boardwalk close to some bars nice views. Just dirty and rundown. Room 511 the only room on the 5th floor without a cooktop or a table to sit at! We had to use the ironing board for a table! Our neighbors in 510 had a kitchenette a fold out couch and a table. 511 is the only room in that hallway considered 'ocean block' not 'ovean view' so book carefully!,kittygirl519
UR117600937,2011-2-September,Saw some of the bad reviews but decided to give it a try - big mistake. Upon arrival noticed no bath towels and had to ask for them. Staff was very nice and delivered them to the room. Once we were back in the room noticed dirty floor black mold in caulk in bathroom mold on shower curtain and ceiling tiles in the bathroom. Toilet in bathroom not bolted to floor well-felt extremely wobbly. Internet service was useless broken ice maker on floor. If I needed ice I could go to lobby or pay for an 8 lb. bag. Rooftop pool not clean and had algae on the tiles.,Deborah B
UR100393335,2011-16-March,While we have never stayed at the Tidelands.....Unfortunately I had already booked a room for this June and then checked this website for reviews. When I called to cancel my reservations I was told very sacasticly that they have no control over people who have "a bone to pick with them" and if I chose to believe it then he would cancel my reservation minus the 10% service fee. I lost about 20 dollars in this deal but feel it is worth it. I picked this hotel in the beginning because we are taking my grandson along with us and I wanted him to experience being right on the boardwalk. So instead I booked again at a motel that we stayed at last year.,mrsratman
UR116724930,2011-14-August,I stayed here for 4 nightand five days the hotel is very high priced for what you recieve and I'm not happy that my stay was not child friendly Bad lauguage into the morning hours hallways yelling into the AM. On Saturday the police had been called in several times up to 12 at night. We were told it was for the smell of pot I don't know why the rooms withthe people were not told to leave ...I stayed in room 329 the sink woyld not drain the lights in the bathroom are so dim my wife could not shave in the shower...for 260.00 a night it was a nightmare.....The bar was decent,FineDining2
UR115258254,2011-11-July,date:10 july 2011 one hotrun downslow elevator with everyone including staff having to use it.The staff had an attitude as well as some guests.Numerous complainers at desk so we went to room to call down to front desk about water in our bed.They did finally move us but the evening was shot.Very small and drty pool.We frequent Ocean City will never stay there again. .,ebbie7
UR78888840,2010-9-September,we have stayed here numerous times in the past years this was terrible!! dirty and moldy! upon entering found both beds in suite broken!! maitenence did come to fix supports but cant believe housekeeping didnt notice when they made up the room. one day there were cleaning supplies left in bathroom but no towels guess someone was in a hurry. refrigerator didnt work so housekeeping had to use hair dryer to defrost. no ice machines. and the worst staircase ever!! complained to desk numerous times about no lights in staircase and terrible smell. the manager Paul was never available to talk to. i did e-mail the Tidelands upon our return with no response of course.,sunbum13
UR69954786,2010-6-July,This was the worst hotel stay I have ever experienced. The housekeeping staff needed training on how to properly clean rooms. The floors were not swept daily and we did not receive clean towels (even after leaving the dirty ones in a pile on the bathroom floor). The shower was a mildewy mess and the shower curtain had mold on it. Our room had no table or chairs. The only place to sit was on the beds. It was challenging trying to get my 7 year old to eat his breakfast cereal while sitting on a bed. The deal breaker for me was the fact that they did not have an ice machine. They actually charged us $1.00 for a bag of ice. The front desk staff said that the ice machine was broken. However I saw the cooler where they got the bagged ice and the setup looked permanent to me. Why not be honest and say that they sell ice to their guests? I've never stayed at a hotel that did not have an ice machine. Clearly customer service is not a priority here. Lying to guests demonstrates that. I know I did not pay to stay at the Waldorf Astoria but the staff could have been more helpful and courteous when assisting me with a problem with our room. In fact my problem was not treated with concern or priority. In addition our rooms keys had to be reset everyday. Imagine getting to your room with a 7 year old that has to go to the bathroom to find that your room key is not working again. What a hassle.!!!!! I would never stay here again or recommend this dump to anyone. I wouldn't let my dog stay here.,trensha
UR73789357,2010-4-August,I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. The rooms were dirty. Housekeeping did not make the beds or drop off linens one day. We had to ask for toilet paper another day. (In all fairness we noticed things were better on the days that certain people were working.) Parking was very hard to find. "Overflow parking" was a block away in a random lot. The front desk personnel were rude and not very helpful (although the male clerks were much more friendly and helpful). Security was non-existent. Doors leading to the alleyways were propped open all night. The pool closed at 9:00 p.m. but every night people were being loud and music was blaring way after midnight. Took us two days to catch up with the hotel manager. He never seemed to be around. No ice; had to buy it from the front desk. No doors dividing the two sleeping areas; so no privacy. The only thing this place has going for it is the location.,JMP60
UR69227996,2010-30-June,My family has been on vacation every year for 20 years and this place was a nightmare. We started off in room 325 but the a/c didn't work so they moved us to room 328. We had a 2 room suite and was booked for 5 nights but stayed for 4. We would have relocated to another hotel but we paid for this place in advance and they have a strict NO REFUND POLICY and we couldn't afford to absorb the cost of another hotel. When we returned home from OC I called the OC Health Department to report the overall filthiness of this hotel. I learned that the state of Maryland has no guidelines for cleanliness for hotels. I couldn't believe it. It''s no wonder this hotel is so shoddy and the staff is so rude and unfriendly. We had bedbugs which the OC Health Department has to check so I happily reported it. There was a horrid smell in the stair well (which was absolutely filthy) and the entire third floor. Save your breath if you want to complain because these people simply don't care they already have your money and you will not get a refund. The fire alarm went off one night at about 11 p.m. so the whole place had to be evacuated. We received no discount or explanation from the staff and the manager was very scarce and spent most of his time hiding from all of the complaining guests. This place blows.,kakell565
UR73072393,2010-30-July,I wish I would have read all your reviews before hand. All the ice macines were broke(quite a coincidence) but you could buy a bag for a 1.00 quote from the desk clerk "The cheapest around". I would not have booked this hotel. When we entered our room it' was dirty. I had to go to the front desk and ask that the sheets be changed there was dirt and black hair on the sheets. The floors were filthy and the floor boards and corners needed a good scrubbing. The wter pressure was awful I had a drizzle for a shower. I have stayed at the Casablanca Howard Johnsons Flamingo Holiday Inn and other hotels along the board walk(I wanted to stay closer) what a mistake. This is terrible that people actually stay here and no one seems to care. Although I will check all reviews before I rent a hotel room again. I'm a nurse and talk about infection control.,kitkka
UR77584165,2010-30-August,We decided to stay at this hotel cause it seemed clean and nice from the outside. Believe the bad reviews and no people are not being snotty and expecting the Hilton. When you pay over $230 for one night you expect certain things. One would expect a blanket on the beds and not just some flimsy comforter that looks like it hasnt been washed in years. I wore my flipflops in the shower and bascially the whole time we were in the room. The pool is extremely small for a hotel that size. No out door shower they ask that you not bring sand into the hotel well how about providing a "shower" or simply a hose for people to rinse off prior to entering the hotel. The bathroom in the pool area was utterly disguesting with not ventilation. Ice Machines are non existent and if you want ice you have to pay for it!! I have never ever had to pay for ice. One could go on and on.... My recommendation is to find another hotel..,XmareX78
UR73665655,2010-3-August,We had stayed at this hotel several years ago when it first opened and had a good experience. We decided we'd check it out once again because of it's ideal location near the boardwalk beach and amusements. What a disappointment!!! When we first got into the room we went out onto the balcony to check out our view. When we stepped back in to close the sliding glass door it wouldn't budge. I spoke with two people at the front desk. After the first call a housekeeper closed it for us and said it needed to be fixed by maintenance. After waiting for a half hour no one showed up. Second call yielded nothing. Finally after my husband called the manager maintenance showed up. That was a joke too. He left to get some "parts" and didn't come back again until my husband called the manager once again to see when this guy was coming back. The manager also said he would do something for us because of all this trouble. One of the most disturbing finds was the mildew in the bathroom. Not small areas but large areas clumps of mildew in the shower and in the corners of the bathroom near the tub. Totally unacceptable! The entrance we always utilized coming into the hotel was always full of flies. The service was terrible as well. Our room was not ready until after 3PM. Later this summer we are returning to Ocean City but have already made reservations elsewhere. I would rather spend the extra money and stay in a clean room with friendly service. Additionally the two pools they have are very small and there were never enough chairs for everyone. People were literally tripping over each other. Parking is like all the hotels in that area--tight. Also the water pressure in our bathroom was terrible. We couldn't even brush our teeth in the bathroom sink. We had to use the sink in our kitchenette area One day we had to call maintenance again to unclog our tub as the water would not go down. I was ready to come home from this vacation thanks to Tidelands.,nursefunky
UR69139849,2010-29-June,I would not recamend this DISGUSTING hotel to anyone. The staff was rude as well as the housekeeping staff didn't even sweep out our room daily when they sopposely cleaned. We had sand that built up because they have tile floors. They get wet and get very slippery. The staff at the front counter was rude when asked for directions for a local resturaunt. Thier hallways smell disgusting like fresh vomit. I woud l never stay here again with my children. There was parting going on all through the night in the hallways with people banging on doors. Trust me save your money and go some where with a 5star rating. They have no rating here!!!!!,krose123
UR77421435,2010-29-August,Have to agree with others this was not a good hotel. At first look it looks great when you see the size of the room and the king size beds. However look a little closer and you will see the mold and mildew on the ceilings tub and floor. The towels and washcloths were a dingy gray color. I don't think they ever saw and bleach. One of our room mates found pubic hair on the side of her sheets. The bathroom fan was so covered in dust that it couldn't have done a bit of good. The good was looked like it had been rinsed out and put away dirty. Anyone off of the street could gain access to any floor of the hotel just by walking in and taking the stairs or elevator including the pool on the 5th floor and the bar side pool. Will not stay here again.,cookingpamiam
UR81364698,2010-28-September,I stayed at the Tidelands 4 years ago and stayed again this past weekend for Sunfest. From the outside the hotel still presents well but the rooms have really deteriorated. They need painted badly pillowcases and towels were stained and grayish both beds were very hard and squeaked loudly with every move and the shower pressure was very very low. Early the morning of our last day the AC fan started squeaking. Finding a parking spot on site was difficult still in September because of Sunfest. Our room was facing the street so it was very noisy. On the upside the rooms are large and ours had a jacuzzi tub which was nice but took a long time to fill because of low water pressure. The desk employees were friendly and allowed us to check in early. The pool and pool bar looked inviting but that is not enough for me to book again. I will try somewhere else next time.,deltaflyer
UR81131775,2010-26-September,What happened to this place?! Mold dirt broken beds no wash cloths foul smell splashed walls & ceilingbugs in the tub black curly hairs leaking trash bag in the elevator dirt/sand lining each side of the hallway unsecure building staff who could care less! PLEASE do yourself & your family a favor and stay somewhere else!,3patrick3
UR68723020,2010-26-June,We have been staying at the Tidelands on and off for at least 10 years probably more. We have always enjoyed our stay. The rooms were always kept clean perfect location. We loved sitting on the balcony listening to the Ocean and watching the people on the boardwalk. The hotel had also told us that they had completely remodeled. First nightmare two weeks before we arrived a Hooters Restaurant opened right next door. The noise was unbelievable even after they closed people moved outside and partied right in front of the place AND our hotel. Second about the remodeling hmmmm they should get their money back for the LITTLE that was done. The got new cabinets and "granite" counter tops no way were the real granite. The furniture is just as I remembered it may have been new comforters although mine had cigarette burns all through it. They also claimed to have re tiled the bathroom once again if they did they need to get their money back the tiles did not meet up very well and they didn't look any different than before maybe they just replaced some bad ones. Things that were MOST difficult for me other than no sleep the drawer that they put in the kitchen area was not big enough to fit the silverware tray (??) so they laid it on the bottom of the cupboard under the sink I have had recent surgery and can't bend so there was no way for me to get to these an unexpected problem. Next they had safes installed in the rooms nice idea but once again putting them near the floor is not very accessible got me and I am sure many others. We have always recommended this hotel to all our family and friends but unless Hooters finds another home I would not recommend to this place to anyone but teenagers that want to party all night! Believe me there were plenty. The front desk was very friendly and I realize there is nothing they can do about the problems that I encountered. I hope the management reads this and perhaps a couple of hotels could get together and get Hooters away from what used to be a relatively quiet area. So convenient to everything. I am deeply saddened by my visit this time.,Patricia T
UR80897741,2010-25-September,This was our second stay. Broken air conditioning upon arrival to room. Had to switch to suite with a different view. Took 2 hours to get an ashtray. Difficulty getting adequate linen & the "clean" washcloths were stained. Our hallway was very hot little or no air conditioning and wreaked of old seafood smell. No attempt to remedy either when reported. Our balcony chairs were cracked & unsafe. Chaise lounges at rooftop pool broke & unsafe & area was unkempt. Overall cleanliness & maintenance gets maybe a "5" & that's generous. Desk staff certainly not zealous to serve you.` Like location but probably won't stay a third time! We're low maintenance just looking for decent customer service cleanliness & a safe environment. TOO MUCH TO ASK??????,mperks127
UR71848904,2010-22-July,If you want to go to a hotel where the employees sit in a chair and play games while you try to tell them about a problem stay here. I had to buy iceclean the bath tub sweap the floor. The hotel is just DIRTY!!!!!!!!!!!!!! JOLYNN I think I got the name right is RUDE and who is the manger because she or he is Never around. I booked the hotel because it's right on the boardwalk I should have read the reviews before I booked the place. They do have BEGBUGS my 3yr old has bed bugs bites and the manger has yet to call me back. I'm calling the health dept on this hotel.......PLEASE DONT GO TO THIS HOTEL BEDBUGS AND THEY DON'T CARE!!!!!!!!!!!,Marie1968_40
UR76120351,2010-20-August,DO NOT stay at this hotel. We saw & heard multiple fights in other nearby rooms which explains the holes in the room we stayed in which by the way was a two bedroom suite!. The hotel is a dirty mess with bad water pressure dirty towels when providedstained bed sheets and a smell which is a smell unknown to man. The best description is a cross between garlic low tide and vomit. Please DO NOT ignore the other previous posts like we did and go to the Comfort Inn next door for only a few bucks more actually about the same cost with a AAA card. By the way no operational ice machines exist at this hotel and want to charge you a buck for a bag of ice. How can you say SCAM!!! It's a shame because the location is a prime boardwalk location. No wonder the suite was offered at a 30% discount at the time and thought it was too go to pass up...... As the saying goes we get what you pay for which is certainly the case at the Tidelands !!!,funseekerMonroe_Ct
UR79716389,2010-15-September,We were here for 5 days and was very unhappy when we first got there because there was absolutely no parking and they expected us to park 2 blocks down where you had to pay for parking!! Absolutely not I already paid $700 for 5 days I was not about to pay to park. We had an ocean view room with 2 king b eds and a pull out sofa. The maid service was terrible and we constantly had to remind them for towels and such. The floor is all tile and when we checked in the floor was filled with sand and it was never ever swept. The water pressure in the shower is horrible not hot and it took forever to get a shower. The hotel staff was not very friendly nor helpful at all. The pictures posted online are very deceiving please do not believe them. I was very upset that I spent so much money and found all these problems.,shortyjame
UR70644422,2010-12-July,Rooms had sand on the floor. Kitchen had ants. We were not given toilet paper had to get it from front desk. Ice machines were broken (so we were told). Front desk wanted to sell us ice for $1. Pools were very small. Parking was difficult to find. The only good thing was the great location!,andrea19684
UR45898363,2009-5-October,Our first problem was we had reserved a handicapped accessible ocean front room. When we got there it was a side ocean view. I went to the front desk and was told that no one would have ever told me that because they don't have ocean front handicap rooms. Even though I had a confirmation stating ocean front handicap they said I was wrong. The ocean front room was already checked into by our party. We had two ocean front rooms one of which was handicap accessible. I was not happy. Then when we went into the room we discovered that their definition of handicap rooms does not meed ADA standards. The walk in shower had a lip that was at least 2" high. ADA standards are no more than 1/2". The toilet was a regular toilet with a grab bar installed. It was not higher as code says. We could not get the lift under the bed the hallway to the bathroom was very small. The rooms were not clean our refrigerator leaked I could go on and on. There were 15 people in our group and each had at least one complaint about their individual room.,luvthebeach35
UR39402431,2009-31-August,Air conditioning did not work so we were moved to another room. That room had mildew on ceiling and in bathroom. When we asked to check out early we were told that we would not get a refund. Front desk customer service and hotel "management" are impossible to deal with. Do yourself a favor and stay somewhere else!,NewYorkNeeron
UR33413184,2009-28-June,Parking is a hassle there is one elevator for 5 floors. You have to wait for the elevator just a few feet away from the front desk where the space narrows down for one person to be able to pass to this space that is big enough for 3 or 4 people to wait. If you are checking in/out and you have your bags coolers and groceries - good luck. It is a tight fit. The ice machine was broken but if it was working bring money because you have to pay for ice. "Lucky" for us - they were selling bags of ice for $3 the same size you can get at the grocery store for $179. We had to ask for sheets for the pull out bed twice once around 4:00p (so we would have them at bed time later) and again around 9:00p. When the sheets were finally delivered they were shoved in my face and the boy delivering them left quickly no hello no smile no eye contact. He was obviously annoyed to have to deliver sheets. When we went to bed both king beds had sand in the sheets. I have been going to OC MD for almost 20 years I'm not sure how you get sand in clean unused sheets. The morning of check out there were signs in the elevator advising guests of extended checkout rates. We were going to the beach before leaving for home so we thought extended checkout was a good idea. When we asked about it we were told our room didn'ty apply for extended checkout. That makes no sense - do you want the extra $45 dollars or not? So we went back to our room at 10:45am to gather our things to be out by 11:00am. Only the keys didn't work anymore because they are programmed to expire at check out which is fine but it wasn't 11:00a yet. So I went back to the desk to have the key reprogrammed. The grumpy girl at the desk reprogrammed the key but as I said her personality has much to be desired. Which is something I don't need when I am paying $269 a night. How about a smile? How about not acting like you are doing me a favor? How about opening your mouth and speaking a lilttle louder? I don't know her name but she is the brunette with the long bob. Definatly not a friendly person. I wouldn't stay here again and I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone not worth the money paid..,gehpa
UR45076406,2009-27-September,My family and I just came back from Tidelands and we would not stay again. It was by far the noisiest hotel I have EVER stayed in my whole life. We booked a Bay view king suite for $189 per night. I read on Trip Advisor and on the Tidelands website that the hotel has been renovated. WARNING...not all rooms have been renovated. Our room was clean but our biggest problem was the street noise and the two rooms above us full of wasted teenagers. We were traveling with a three year old and our first night we did not get to sleep until 2 a.m. We called the front desk to complain twice and nothing was done at all. The next morning I complained to Paul the manager who assured me that he would handle the situation. That night we didn't hear a peep out of the two rooms above. Why does it take talking to a manager to get this resolved??? We have family who stayed in a pool view suite and they had a huge hole in their mattress! We were told that our rooms had been renovated and our family has holes in their mattress and we had broken furniture. We could not find an ice machine in the entire hotel that worked and the bar makes the worst drink I have ever had in my life. If you like to party (really hard) stay up drinking all night and scream off of balconies this is the place for you. Party on Dude!,Letgo7
UR35623385,2009-23-July,We found the Tidelands Carribbean online after hours and hours of looking for something on the boardwalk so our teens would have lots to do. In all the back and forth looking and comparing I forgot to check some reviews until AFTER I booked 3 nights in August. Then after reading such horrible reviews including bedbug issues mold and general odor and filth I tried not to panic and decided to call and find out what had been done about these issues. I was told I'd have to talk to the manager and they would leave a message for him to call me since he leaves everyday around 5 not back in until 9 am the next day. (No manager on duty any evening another red flag) I also sent an email asking for a call addressing my concerns. No return email or return phone call after 3 days! I finally called back and asked for the manager. The clerk on the phone was rude and interupted me several times. "Look I can't do anything but take your name and number and give him the message." was her response. I of course mentioned that I had already done that and no one returned my call. She then said "Do you want to leave a message or not!" I said "Excuse me? is that really how you talk to your customers!?!?" I asked for her name and she hung up on me. If this is their customer service before you even arrive I thought I'd better take all those bad reviews seriously. I called back two hours later and cancelled my reservation. We are now staying one day less for $100 more a night at the Holiday Inn & Suites on 17th/Boardwalk . . . of course I made sure I read the reviews FIRST.,getaway45
UR33733948,2009-2-July,I stayed at the Tidelands with my four children and my sister and her daughter stayed in another room. Neither of our rooms was ready by check-in. Bathroom by roof top pool was filthy toilet not working no trash can. Pool area was filthy again no trash can so trash was everywhere. Both pools very small. One king bed was completely lopsided and box spring had to be replaced. No bedding for pull out. Had to call three times and took 3 hours to receive with tired children waiting. Many rooms in seperate buildings which are not on boardwalk actually at least half block from ocean. Might as well pay less for not boardwalk location. No broom in room walked on sandy cold tile floor for two days. Halls smelled of mildew due to previous flooding. Outside walking to pool area smelled of trash due to trash cans lining the path. Finally my car was keyed up and down both sides 20 minutes after arrival. I informed front desk who could have cared less.,tripletsplus1mom
UR37764507,2009-15-August,Main door could not be opened by a child as were many rooms we went in and out of. Sliding door took a trained adult to open. Room & towels reeked of smoke. One bed sagged in the middle due to broken box spring. Mold in room corners. Black mold dripping from AC register on 5th floor. Upper pool gate broken entirely. Most of the parking is two blocks away. None of the front desk employees would smile if they had to especially Mrs Frown. 2 out of four bathroom lamps were out for our entire stay. Had to purchase Ice. Only one elevator for all rooms. Overall it was Disgusting and a run down establishment. It appears that they get your money and do not care about anything else. Wireless access worked 20% of the time but it is included. But it was close to the boardwalk and a really cool Kite Store called The Kite Loft.,Audioi
UR33669076,2009-1-July,So I usually go with my friends to Ocean City once a year and this year we picked a bad hotel -- Tidelands. First off the hallways reeked of something terrible can't really describe the smell -- maybe a mix of paint and trash? The bathroom was pretty gross -- there was rust or something dark on the bottom of the bath tub that couldn't be washed away (very unsightly) and it was clearly an old bathroom with some weird dried glue stuff or something on the edges of the sink. The bed covers were also stained which was not comforting. Pillows were all different some lumpy some fatter some flatter not very nice pillows. Internet was super slow. The housekeeping decided not to clean our room the 2nd day because one person was in there when they arrived and instead they dropped off 3 towels (it was a 4-person room). With all the sand from the beach and dirty towels it would have been really nice to have the place cleaned! On top of that there wasn't enough parking one evening and we had to search for parking on the street. Oh and there was a fire alarm one of the mornings at around 7:30 AM so we had to evacuate. We stayed 3 nights and were quite glad to leave. In short this was NOT a pleasant place to stay. The only good thing about it is the location. We've stayed at other hotels in Ocean City before and they were not this old and dirty so try another place instead.,TennisRF
UR18788308,2008-9-August,This was the worst experience I have ever had at a hotel in my life. I could mentions many many many little things such as dirty rooms dirty linens broken beer bottle behind the night stand. But none of these complaints comes close to how our trip ended. On our last morning we had the door open on us by the next tenant who was going to be staying in our room!!! We had not even checked out  it was before 11am and the next person had already been giving a key to our room. The lady was extremely rude and said "oh we just wanted to put our bags on the floor until you check out"!!!! We werent allowed to check in until 3pm. I would never in a million years recommend this place to anyone.,rstair36
UR19898969,2008-8-September,The website for this hotel is a HUGE LIE!!! This place was filthy dirty and smelled awful! The ceiling in the room we stayed in had mold all over it! The furniture was filled with dust and the floor was so dirty I don't think they have swept it all summer! The sheets had blood on them. Not just one sheet but all of them! We called the front desk to ask for clean ones and the person at the front was so rude. He said someone will be up soon and hung up on me. It took them 30 minutes or more to come up and then they knocked at the door and left the sheets in front of the door. The bathroom was gross also. The tiles were dirty and there was still hair in our shower! The elevator didn't work either. If it wasn't for the storm we would have stayed somewhere else! The fire alarm or some other alarm kept going off at 5 o'clock in the morning!!! The beds were extremely uncomfortable and not a king size as we were promised. The towels and washcloths were gross as well. When we left the room we hung the "Do Not Disturb" sign on the door and housekeeping totally ignored it. They came in our room anyway. Thank god I didn't have anything of any value with me because the people there cannot be trusted! The pool was gross and the food at the "pool bar" was terrible! The waitress or at least I think she was supposed to be one didn't speak English very well and was also very rude. When she brought the check to us we weren't even ready for it she said "You need to pay now because I am leaving for the day and I want to close your check." I can't believe this place is even still open. I will be contacting the Health Department regarding the unsanitary conditions of this hotel!,Ocvacationer
UR18675447,2008-6-August,This place looks so great on the internet! It's Not! The room was disgusting. The ceiling was covered in black mold and I wouldn't even let my 5 year old take a shower it was so gross! The bed frame was beautful but the bed was no thicker than a piece of foam and our beach towels made better pillows. The sheets were dirty the elevator broke several times when we were there there was no parking the staff was rude and the pools were the size of bath tubs. I was so disappointed! We spent a lot of money on this vacation thinking that it would be worth it we were wrong!,tlc1100
UR19785941,2008-5-September,Contrary to the inviting pictures on their website - this hotel should have its license revoked. Dirty - blood stained sheets bed mites black mold on ceilings rude staff. Is it any wonder they have a no refund policy? Run - don't walk away from this place AS FAST AS YOU CAN! After one very uncomfortable night sleeping in our clothes due to the filth I'm headed to the Hilton even though I paid for 3 nights at the Tidelands. It'll still be cheaper than my doctor bills would be for treating whatever disease my wife & I pick up from this dump. Ugh!!!,OCTRAVEL911
UR17552742,2008-5-July,Booked 3 nights originally asked for a additional night (4th) once there. Original rate was $219.00 per night plus tax and $5. something for use of phone that never could dial outside plus safe in room. Was charged over $380.00 for one more night called front desk and questioned?? was told manager could increase rates at any time they wanted. Although the 2008 brochure at the front desk rates are set in writing. Within small print it does state prices are subject to change Stayed in the double suite overlooking the pool. Dirty under pull out couch beds and bathroom tub scum. Front desk rude and uncertain of rates and many other things. Should be drug tested before hiring. Parking......Good luck they offer parking under canopy(holds about 30 cars) or 2 blocks away that you can pay for. The food at the pool bar is slow and very expensive the bar claims to stay open until 2:00 a.m. but was always in a rush to get you out and close up by 12:00 - 12:30. Ice makers on 5th and 4th floor are always broke you can walk to 3rd and get some if not out. DO NOT USE THE SAFE in the room hotel employees can.do access these. Test yourself tell the staff at desk you forgot your combination to the safe and see how fast they open it for you????? Room service came into my room although I requested NO service. The pool is very small and is advertised as being open to the public so it gets packed by everyone that is not staying there. This is in hopes of attracting people to the pool for sales of food and drinks at there bar. You feel you are sharing your whole vacation with everyone. Lounge chairs are taken up by the pool by other vacationers. Stay home before you stay here!!!!,ebsaville
UR19744050,2008-4-September,Well this hotel came as a recommendation from a family memeber who was used to staying at the main building on the Boardwalk. I was not informed when booking the two bedroom suite that it was on Baltimore Ave. I was told pool view and partial ocean view which it did have. We were not happy about the longer walk to the Boardwalk and beach since I had my elderly mother with me who just went through a major cancer surgery and was unable to walk far distances. That is why I chose to stay at the Tidelands in the first place....big surprise when we were put in the other building on the 5th floor. No I can only vouch for my stay but I did take pictures and you can judge for yourself. The room was DIRTY!!!!! It looked like it was not dusted in weeks prior to our arrival the floors were a flithy mess and we found clothes and candy in the drawers. Not a big deal. When we told the staff down stairs they immediately contacted the head of housekeeping. The next day our refridgerator stopped working. We called down again. The head of housekeeping was up within a 1/2 hour to address the refridgerator issue as well as the other issues. She was called at home the night before. She was very dissappointed and promised to fix the situation completely. We had a new refridgerator delivered and she was to tell our housekeeper about the problems and they should be fixed. The floor was then cleaned. But even though Norma the head of housekeeping was to speak with her staff on that floor her staff obviously did not listen. We never got the extra towels promised the floor of the room was never cleaned the bathroom mirror was never cleaned one day I had the same dirty kitchen towels left. By day 4 we were so completely disgusted we couldn't wait to get out of there. You could not walk on the floor with out shoes or your feet or socks would get completely dirty. Oh I forgot the toaster made the smoke alarms go off.....and my husband had to remove them from the walls to get them to stop. No one ever checked out this situation either. Yes it was no big deal but if it was no one seemed to be aware of it. Also the air conditioner from the hall leaked water on the floor in front of our door and made a big mess when you would walk in it(not knowing it was there)and drag that into the room. I have included pictures of where the refridgerator was dragged in the room on Sunday and the floor was never cleaned....we left Wed. and I took these pictures. The pictures are of the corner of the floor the black mold on the ac some brown stain on the bottom bed sheet also not properly put on the bed crumbs on the floor from Sunday and marks from the refridgerator being dragged in and never clean. The staff down stairs were nice and tried to be helpful but I can only speak for the people I dealt with on that day and the staff changed daily. Will we be staying there again? NO. For the price we paid I would expect more. Oh and yes I agree with others that the parking situation was terrible. Walking 2 plus blocks with some one with a cane is NOT an option. We were just fortunate enough to find some thing under our building.,lala_k
UR17366999,2008-30-June,Our family has been taking shore vacations for many years never stayed in a place that was so "DIRTY"..... The housekeeping was the worst I have ever seen. The bed linens and towels were full of hair. The floors had sand all over them. The toiletries in the room were never replenished. The stove didn't work and the dishes were dirty. No pillows or blankets for the pull out sofa either. The ice machine didn't work properly and cost money. I have never stayed in a hotel that you had to pay for ice. Our room was across from the area where trash was disposed. When you walked out in the hall way it actually made you sick to your stomach........ My daughter was pregnant so needless to say she actually had to cover her face before she left the room because it gaged her. This was the worst thing I have ever experienced in all my years of traveling. The pool area was very slippery in many places as my granddaughter couldn't even 'WALK' NOT RUN BEFORE SHE WAS ON THE GROUND. When I went to check-out I expressed my concern with our stay and it was if they could care less. They really had no response just stood there....... The poorest customer service ever.... They had your money so just keep moving. This was true however we will not be returning to that disgusting place ever again..... A vacation is supposed to be good memories not one that you just want to forget that you were ever there. This place ruined our family vacation ............,BuddyM44
UR17343156,2008-29-June,We booked 4 nights at $1035 only stayed 2 didn't recieve any money back. Room was filthy bathroom had mold on walls and sink didn't drain. Under pull out sofa there was a lighter shower cap bandaid and years of dirt. Old mattresses very uncomfortable no blankets or mattress covers. Didn't want to sit on furniture it was too dirty. The hotel staff was just as bad as the room. This hotel falsely portrays itself don't make the same costly mistake our family made. Ocean City has a great beach and boardwalk but staying at the Tidelands ruined our family vacation!!!,Raven1WestVirginia
UR23074642,2008-29-December,I stayed at this hotel for the last several years. Each year my experience got worse. This year was the absolute worst! We've always had problems with the cleanliness of the room- mold in the bathroom dirty floors broken furniture. This year we actually had bugs in our bed! We asked to be moved to a different room which they did at 11pm at night and were told we'd be compensated for the trouble. We were surprised to find that the room we vacated was occupied the next day without ever being fumigated- ewww! When we checked out we mentioned the situation and the only compensation we received was a late checkout. A 5pm checkout on a Sunday in October is not compensation. I even emailed them after we returned to let them know about the problems and to make some suggestions for improving their establishment. They never even emailed me back. Very poor customer service and very poor hotel. We will not be staying there again.,MMCPET
UR18264840,2008-26-July,Positives 1. Close to the amusements 2. Room ready early 3. Resonably priced 4. Outside pool bar 5. Nice rooms for the price Negatives 1. Not enough parking 2. Cars in lot without parking permits 3. Sand in bed sheets 4. Worn down sofa bed 5. Maid service never gave us enough towels toilet paper I probably would go back because it is a good value considering the location. I really don't need a 5 star hotel because I usually don't plan on spending much time in the room. If you find a parking spot try not to move your car. Shake out your bed sheets. Tolerate the broken down sofa bed. Harass the front desk if you don't have enough amenities. The management will never change and why should they change? They offer a prime location at a reasonable price.,brucePA
UR17213545,2008-25-June,I have been staying att his hotel for 6 years. Use tolove it good deals nice location etc...But this year I found teh hotel rooms very dirty. Beer bottles dirty & body waste everywhere. I had my room changed three times. Each room same old problem. When I complain the front desk said o well. I did not recieve anything for my terrible stay. I will not be using this hotel in the furture.,stoppp
UR18168283,2008-23-July,This hotel looked very appealing on the internet and their write-up looked very good. We go to OC every year and normally stay at The Holiday Inn & Suites - 17th street (wonderful above average hotel) but decided to try somewhere different. This hotel is located on 5th street - absolutely NO PARKING. We stayed in a suite because we had many people staying; needless to say we had two cars. Their policy is one parking permit per room. Okay I understand that but we couldn't even find parking for one car and my car was across the highway down a side street after an HOUR - (no exaggeration) of driving around. This made us decide to stay in the immediate area and not use our cars to go anywhere in the area which was confining. So the last night we decided to go for dinner farther away and upon returning again we ran into the same problem - no parking. This time our first car found a spot at the hotel right away and I eventually came to the hotel after about 45 minutes of driving around looking for a spot. I found one at the hotel and asked the hotel staff if I could possibly stay there it was our last night could I please just stay there I had been riding around for quite a while. They said "no" their policy was one permit per room. I told them that the Holiday Inn and Suites on 17th street had the same policy and out of good customer service they gave us a second permit. They said "well their manager must have approved it". They weren't very helpful or concerned in any way and they had vacancies - so it's not like every room had a permit. On another note for a suite that eight people would be staying in there were four towels (no hand or face towels) and no sheets for the pull-out sofa bed. Room was clean. Did not like tile floors - I read that in a review before we went and didn't really pay attention to it but with sand and wet feet it can be dangerous as well as not very "comfy" I guess. Also for a suite with that many people there was one bathroom. Sometimes there's an additional vanity area outside the bathroom - not so here so if you have many adults going plan accordingly to get your turns in the bathroom. So in general I would give this hotel 2 out of 5 stars and if I may recommend the Holiday Inn and Suites on 17th street (5 stars +). Hope this is helpful in someway to someone.,DreamOnMaryland
UR18132875,2008-22-July,first of all upon checking in I stood there for aleast 10 min. because frnt. desk took a phone call during me checking in and the other one(staff) typed on her cell phone I asked what time the pool closed and was told 11pm I reserved 2 roomswe checked in went swimming and next thing you know one of the hotel employees came to the pool area whistled loudly and told everyone to get out the pool because it was closed I ask him why he told me because it is I explained to him that the front desk said it closed at 11pm and I will speak to the front desk he screamed in my face while I was holding my infant I am the front desk I proceeded to the front desk were I checked in and she told me that I need to make a complaint to the man. because they have had several compliaints about this staff speaking to customers so rudely proceedeing back to the pool area where now a full arguement was taking place between drunken staff and druken guest and my family after everything my entire family was kicked out of the hotel after only being there for 11/2 hr. the staff said they had a problem with one of the guest but kicked all 3 rooms out with no refund saying they felt threatened in my room was myself my husband who is paralyzed in a wheelchair and my 1yearold twin infants(threat really) no money was refunded nothing in black and white stating that we violated anyone to be kicked out no contracts avail. no rules posted no policies posted nothing a complete rip off I am taking legal action I am also filing a civil complaint.,milah202
UR19246549,2008-22-August,This hotel was one of the worse. They state on their website advertisement on how good it is to stay there but it was all fake. Firest off their rooms are dirty and their beds don't have fitted sheets. We discovered bed mites in both beds complained about it asked for a different room with no availability they never got back to us. The air-conditioner was not working and when they finally send someone to fix it it was a day before we were leaving. They provided 1 roll of toilet paper and sometimes did not come clean the room until 4p.m. The staff was very rude and acted like you were bothering them when you asked a question and their was no coffee but a coffee maker was in the room. We want to contact the better business bureau mostly because of the bed mites that were in the bed this is very unhealthy and because of this and them not correcting the problem when we complained we slept at a friends house the remaining time only coming back to the room to get a change of clothes. We should be repremended and have our money returned to us ...,delagirl
UR17065034,2008-19-June,This place looked nice from the outside but what a joke the rooms was never cleaned up trash every where. Talked to the manager about it and nothing was ever done. I really don't think this place was even up to fire code. The first room was filled with a nasty smell trash in the steps.Lots of drunks on both sides tryed 3 rooms thinking it would get better but thay got worse one had no lighting at all. NEVER AGAIN HARVEY JEWELL [---315-2273] Please don't waste your money. And you will NOT get any of your money back or knocked off of your bill.,PROMANO4
UR20885068,2008-14-October,Checked in on Thursday and the elevator was out. I am currently recovering from a fractured bone in my left leg. I had to hoof up three sets of stairs to get to my room. When I checked in I was told that it would be repaired in one to two hours. It was finally repaired at 10 p.m. This did not finish off the problems with the elevator. All day Friday it was making horrible noises and the door took forever to close. I told the desk staff several time but they didn't seem to comcerned. Later that night it stopped working again so up three flights of steps. Saturday morning it was still out of order and was finally fixed at about 10 a.m. This was not the only problem we had. Several of the light bulbs in the lamps were out the coffee pot for the coffee maker was missing and the radio/clock did not work.These things should be checked daily. Also the towels were horrible. Dingy white old worn out. It was horrible. We have stayed there numerour times but this was by far the worse ever.,dancingbare1383
UR20529420,2008-1-October,At a recent stay at the Tideland Caribbean Hotel in Ocean City MD. I was awoken in the middle of the night to find bedbugs crawling all over the bed and myself. There were more than 50 bedbugs on the bed. It was a major infestation. I immediately called the front desk to complain and ask to be moved to a different room. I was told they would have to contact management before they could do that. After about a half an hour we were moved to a room in a different building this was at 4 am in the morning. The next day no one ever called to apologize for our inconvience or the fact that I had experienced one of the most horrifying moments in my life. When we checked out we spoke to the manager to complain about our ruined vacation. They refused to credit any of our money back. After considerable discussion and after saying we would never stay in that hotel again the manager did give us a voucher for a free two night stay. We had to pack all our luggage in plastic bags and disinfect everything before bringing into our home. I need a vacation to recover from that vacation. I understand these things happen occasionally but it was the total lack of compassion from the hotel manager that made the situation even worse.,mickiecat
UR8352555,2007-5-August,The furnishings were OK but the beds were saggy. There was hardly any water pressure in the bathrom sink. The rooftop pool was smalland the 2nd floor pool was a little bigger with a small bar. When we came back from Dinner there was no parking left in the Hotel lot They had another lot a couple of blocks down! We decided to pay for parking that night to get close to the hotel. They do not have near enough parking! They only had one small elevator for each lobby. We had to wait for the elevator alot to get up to our room.,Poggy05
UR8619382,2007-4-September,We booked this hotel for 4 nights and left after the first night. The hotel was poorly kept and the service was horrible. We had not towels in our room and upon requesting them didnt receive them until 7pm. We opted to leave after the first night despite losing the money was paid for the stay.,d75angel
UR8537072,2007-29-August,We had trouble from checkin on. . The room 314 was not ready until after 3pm. After i checked in I noticed a large patch of black mold on the ceiling by the bathroom. When I went to complain the manager Mike moved me to an even less desirable room located out by the street where unruly's were partying all hours of the night. Additionally this is the only hotel i stayed at where you have to pay for ice.. For a pricey hotel the halls and carpets were run down. I would recommend checking out different hotels in the area. It's plus side was the location right on the boarrdwalk.,travelguyNycNy
UR10401423,2007-28-October,This hotel is very run down. Bathroom stains paint coming off the walls no balcony furniture no table or desk in the room. Small fridge microwave toaster and coffee maker stacked up like building blocks. The location is very good but its SO noisy at night until about 3am. Very limited parking. The pool and pool bar were the best part then they decided to close it before Labor Day. What? Unless the price is right I will not stay here again.,KCashVa
UR8220547,2007-23-July,First off the hotel has two buildings with separate lobbies which I was unaware of. I registered in one had to drive to the next building and search for parking! We unloaded the car and had to search the hotel for a luggage cart that had wheels that did not want to move. Once we got to our floor it reaked of OLD cigarette smoke. We were put on a smoking floor! WE agreed we could take it. Our room was nice with tile floors not so great for sandy feet! We noticed someone had stuck a bathing suit crotch liner on the wall! YUCK! How the maid could have overlooked something so obvious was questionable. It stayed there for four days! No coffee for the coffee maker too! The bathroom was small and the toilet seat was stained with cigarette burns. The location of the room and the view was great! We could sit and look at the boardwalk and ocean. The hotel roof pool was "under construction" which was a major disappointment since the hotel brochure boasts of a rooftop pool and hot tubs and an amazing view! We couldn't even get to the roof past the signs! The hotel pool bar was nice but the drinks were over priced and priced differently in the menus from what we were charged! I would not stay here again.,beachlover20
UR8471617,2007-22-August,I recently stayed at the Tidelands and was very disappointed with their services. I booked the trip because family members had suggested it. There were four people in in my party so we had a nice suit with 2 king size beds bathroom and kitchen. However the matresses were terribly uncomfortable. There were 2 flat pillows for each bed. When we asked for 2 more pillows they simply replied"we don't have extra." We wanted to use the kiosk in the lobby to print coupons and maps of places to go/things to do and the desk worker said "Oh it's out of paper.' I asked if there was anything else they could give us and their simple answer was"No." We weren't greeted once when we entered the building. The workers were too busy playing solitare on the computer. I work in the hospitality industry and this was one of the worst experiences I have had. The workers were not friendly and of no help. I know we only paid $1000 to stay there but you think we would have been treated like guests on vacation..I guess not.,dramatravel

UR8823207,2007-19-September,I don't even know where to begin first of all the parking is terrible. This over priced dump was so filthy that I don't think I'll ever forget it. Lets start with the walk through the hallway to our room. I don't know what died but they need to investigate it. It smelled so bad that I covered my nose just to walk through it. The stairwell wasn't any better. Then as we opened the door to the room you could tell right away it was dirty (and also smelled like roadkill). Half of the lights in the room didn't work the safe was broken the ceiling in the bathroom was caving in not to mention all the mold that was growing all over the place toenail clippings on the balcony (GROSS!!!!!) and the food that was left laying on the floor it was so nasty that my friend or myself never walked in the room without our shoes on. The beds were old and in very much in need of changing. I still can't believe I slept there. We paid alot of money to stay there and we were very excited about our trip to Ocean City. This hotel was our only disapointment. In my opinion they should tear it down and start all over again.,PennsylvaniaTone
UR8688109,2007-10-September,My husband and I vacationed at the Tidelands Carribean in Ocean City Maryland last week. I had checked on Trip Advisor and was told it was recently remodeled and clean. We had some problems with this hotel. First I paid my deposit and upon receiving my credit card bill I noticed that I was charged twice for my deposit. I immediately contacted Tidelands and was told I would need to bring my bill along to show them upon check-in. I presented my bill to the gentleman at the desk and was told he could do nothing about it and that I would have to wait until the next day and meet with the manager. The next morning I took some time out of my vacation schedule and went looking for a manager only to be told that the person on the desk could help me. He looked at my bill and said that he would have to check into the matter and I should come back later. Upon my return I was told that yes I was charged twice but that I was not charged the correct amount for my room and that I now owed an additional $158. and they were giving me a break! Our rooms if newly remodeled were not very clean and there was paint hanging loose from the ceiling and rust on the walls in the bathroom. The tubs had old rubber mats to prevent you from slipping but they were hard and had knobs on them that hurt your feet. Our room had a terrible odor and our patio was full of cigarette butts. To make matters go from bad to worse we arrived back at our hotel on Friday night only to find NO PARKING spaces left. We were told we should park on another hotels parking lot (that was closed for remodeling) and upon arrival we found it to be full of nails wood and other construction materials. Needless to say we are very unimpressed with this place of business! We do have reservations at the Tides again for Sunfest and are hoping that we will be able to write that we had a better experience!,Darkpurple
UR5922643,2006-6-October,This hotel has a great location on the boardwalk. A Dunkin Donuts is within 50 ft of entrance for true coffee drinkers:) The rooms are extremely large with great beds. The cleaning staff was attentive when asked. The down side was moldy(blue) 3ft by 5ft spot on ceilingmolding on bathroom sink coming outrailing on balcony awful as were chairs with dirt and bird ----. The check in was difficult in that apparently Expedia is not used here much and not understood. No big welcome here-no smilesetc. The phone did not work unless you pressed keys in certain way only. I asked for new one-no deal. This hotel is tired - from check in to rooms. I would not pay more then $65-$75 a night. I give it 2 stars out of 5,guffin
UR5703258,2006-24-August,We were extremely disappointed in this hotel. So unhappy in fact that we left before staying a single night. We were supposed to have an ocean-view room and at $300 a night we wanted to see and hear the ocean. The hotel is divided into two main buildings: one that is right on the boardwalk where the oceanfront rooms are located and the other is on the main road. We figured we would at least be in the building closest to the beach. We were wrong. Our "ocean view" was a two inch glimpse of the ocean between two other buildings. Our room basically overlooked the parking lot next door and the main road. The traffic was extremely noisy and when you're staying in a room with young children this can be a problem. And who wants to sit on the balcony and listen to all that? Not that I would sit on the furniture that was out there. It was filthy. The room was also disappointing. The only good things about it were the king-sized beds. The room just didn't seem clean. A lot of reviewers on here say they liked the tile floors but I have to disagree. I thought the tile was kind of gross-I mean I have to wonder how they clean it. Do they just sweep the loose stuff up or do they actually (hopefully) mop and dry the whole thing. I wouldn't have felt comfortable walking on it in my bare feet. Again it just didn't seem clean. To top it off the front was missing off the bathroom sink. Very attractive. If this was supposed to be a newly renovated room I shudder to think of what the old room looked like. Perhaps I'm seeming a bit picky but keep in mind people are paying more than $300 a night during the summer to stay at this place. After seeing the room and our "ocean view" we decided to call another hotel down the street that we had stayed at before. The only reason we had booked the Tidelands was because our other hotel required a 3-night minimum and at the time we didn't meet it. We had changed our plans to include a 3 night stay so our regular hotel was able to accomodate us on incredibly short notice. At our regular hotel-the Quality Inn Beachfront-we got a gorgeous second-floor oceanfront suite with a private balcony and an incredible oceanfront view. We ended up getting this room for less $ over the 3 nights than what the Tidelands cost. We ended up checking out before we stayed a single hour at the Tidelands. They are still planning on charging us for the 3 nights we reserved there and we intend to dispute the charge since the hotel has a strict no-refund policy. All the credit card asked for was proof that we had checked out before staying a full night. Getting any of the staff there to do this was like pulling teeth. Needless to say we will never reserve a room there again.,peachkins
UR5699882,2006-22-August,The people that work here were rude and don't speak English. You are to pay for your full trip when you check in that should have been a warning right there. We called down to the desk our first day for extra towels and they acted like we asked for the moon. We asked for an extra blanket the next night since the air conditioner was uncontrolable. The front desk said only one blanket per room. There were 5 of us! Same goes for pillows flat as pancakes and no extras. But our maid was nice and took care of us. No fitted sheet just flat ones and you woke up on the matress ! Yuk ! My husband said I was being a bed hog but whenever he got in bed I got sucked in the middle. The balcony was only big enough for 2 people. Not fun when you have 3 teenage girls with you. Had to pay for ice and they had only one ice machine. and ONE elevator. Talk about slow our girls took the stairs. No hot water tile falling off and toilet was over flowing good thing they left the plunger next to it !!! I think this was the first vacation where I wanted to go home !! Not to sound snooty but if you like the little extras this hotel isn't for you. We love Ocean City and still had a wonderful time. But next year we are staying in a condo.,OCBeachgoers
UR5763195,2006-2-September,My family stayed at the hotel from 8/28-8/31 this was our 2nd stay. I have to agree with previous posters...if you want to be near all the action of the b'walk this is definitely the place to be. The weekday rate during this time was very reasonable and you can't beat being literally a few steps from the beach. We were in a 2-rm suite on the 4th floor with a poolview. The room was just OK. I noticed some of the same issues I had from 2005--the panel was missing from the fake drawer front below the sink; water pressure in shower horrible; the walls needed to be repainted; the fitted sheet issue; the broken ice machine; the exit doors leading to the parking lot not locking properly; the bad parking situation. I too was concerned about how well they cleaned the tile floors. Our floor had sand on it when we first walked in and it was never completely cleaned during our stay. I noticed a small sand pile in the bathroom on our first day and by check out time it was still there which leads me to believe that housekeeping is not doing a thorough job. Our toilet bowl needed a good scrubbing and the tub had a ring in it from the moment we walked in. It was never cleaned. On our third day I dropped an earring behind one of the nightstands and discovered a half-eaten piece of bread/roll. Again housekeeping needs to be addressed. Management would be wise to spend a night in their own hotel to get a feel for what their customers' experience would be like. Or make random inspections. Many of my complaints and those of others are not hard to solve. Overall the hotel is not bad. I've seen worse and paid more. I'd probably stay there again but I will be doing research on other hotels for next year. It's a shame because they have many things in their favor--price location but they don't seem to put much of their profits back into the place. The hallway carpet and wallpaper needs to be replaced. I appreciate the upgrades they did make but there's still more work to be done.,missush
UR5966262,2006-17-October,My husband and I stayed for a two night trip. The first night we stayed at the Hilton. The second night the Hilton was booked so we decided to try the Tidelands. What a mistake. We looked around the hotel before check in. The stairs leading up to the pool was blocking with plies of bags full of garbage. I am glad there wasn't a fire. The carpets in the hall had stains which looked like vomit. The halls were filthy and covered with holes. The placed smelled like something had died in there. At check in the employees seemed to care less if you were there. It seemed like we were bothering them. It would not hurt to say Hi or even a thank you for staying with us. We got up to our room and the place was disgusting. The people before us left us their soap and washcloth in the tub. The toilet was obvioiusly NOT cleaned at all. The toliet was coming up off the floor it seemed like you were going to slide off. The mildew or black stains around the entire bathroom was very gross. The rooftop was was a joke. It was very small and they had a snow fence plastic gate blocking the side of the pool off. The medal gate had plastic ties holding it together. I am glad our stay was only one night but even that was too long. I would have felt cleaner and safer sleeping in my car. Stay away!,Brianaerin
UR3999579,2005-7-October,The hotel consist of two different buildings If you are planning on staying in the old building that offers Ocean front you might want to stay somewhere else. The hotel is in need of some scerious updating. The ocean front room we stayed in was in need up repairs the walls had stains the bathroom toliet was always running and we had to keep fixing the chain on the toliet so you could flush. The shower walls were missing tiles and by the time you were done showing you were standing in above ankle water. They don't always replace soap shampoo toliet paper and I wonder how good they are at changing sheets. And from guests we talk to their rooms were along the same lines. I know you are thinking if it was so bad why did we continue to stay. Well it was Sunfest weekend and every hotel was sold out we didn't have options. We stayed 3 nights in this room then when the weekend came we had to move to another room for 3 more nights in the other building. Which granted was a million times nicer but still not up to par. I complained to the manager that we wanted to leave and I wanted refunded for the unused nights but they flattley refused they would not give me a refund. He said he would personaly make sure the new room we were moving into was cleaned and spotless. Well there cleaning staff stinks they no extras. For example we found a pair of dirty underware left in one of the dresser drawers. Some cleaning they do. I highly recommend staying away especially during the spring to fall season when the hotels employees foreigners for the summer that can barely speak english. To say the least the customer service was extremley lacking and they had no compassion for my complaints. I will never stay there again I rate this hotel at 1 1/2 stars.,A TripAdvisor Member
