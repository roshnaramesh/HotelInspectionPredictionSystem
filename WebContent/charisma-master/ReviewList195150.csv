UR122832830,2012-9-January,Apart from being well located and cheap (caught a special booking deal online) I can hardly find any advantage of this hotel. It is disgustingly dirty the staff doesnt care about anything at all. Watch out as they have rooms in the street level (semi-basement)....no wifi no daylight there be careful!,pero305

UR123925880,2012-31-January,This hotel was a disaster. We booked a double room and got a room in the basement which was so tiny that there was even no space to open a luggage. The window did not close there was no hot water. Staff was rude and after we demanded to change the room it took as a lot of time to convince them that it is necessary. Would not recommend to anyone.,Pizzicata
UR124776025,2012-18-February,If you are looking for a hotel to stay in London then whatever you do DO NOT stay here. The only thing going for this dump is the location.After checking in was given keys to 105 a family room that was DIRTY AND SMELLY.The carpet was sticky the walls had staines the room STANK !!!! Wife and daughter burst into tearshad to book into another hotel around the corner (the phoenix) Whatever you do not book this hotel YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!!!!!,andy m
UR99574167,2011-9-March,We booked with Super Breaks for a package train and hotel deal for one night with two teenagers my husband and myselftravelling from Rural lancashire. The situation of the hotel is convenient however inside is a different matter. The rooms were so 'meanly ' provided for with the absolute bare minimum for example there was only one partially used toilet roll one tea bag one sachet of coffee each no soap and no shampoo. I also noticed there was only one pillow per person and no extra blankets ( which are usually found stored in the wardrobes.) The room was fairly clean but the paint job done by whoever decorated the hotel was awful. An example would be in the hallways and stairs the plug sockets had been painted around with what looked like the neatness of a yard broom. There was also this awful one inch high step going into the bathrooms which all of us had stubbed ours toes on! The beds were in actual fact camp beds that fold up! So we both rolled into the middle all night CAMP BEDS! I cannot believe I spent all my hard earned money for one night on a cheap camp bed . Myself and my family decided to hold judgment until the morning and see what the breakfast was like.. What a disappointment !!..I had built this trip up to be the trip of a life time describing to my teenage children the wonders of London and the infamous Full English. All that was available was as followed: Please be assured that I do not exaggerate in any detail at all. On arrival at the lounge one large glass salad bowl with cornflakes which one used a cup to serve ones self a portion. Also another large salad glass bowl filled with bran flakes.No yoghurts no fruit. No toast was offerered until we found someone to make eye contact with ( all staff purposely ignored you. )We waited for 45 minutes for one sausage eachone rasher of bacon one egg and a raw (yesTOTALLY raw ) tomato no mushroomsno beans no sauces I really must stress again that this is not exaggerated in any way! Every one else was un happy there as well no one was served within 45 minutes and as we left we saw a gentleman complaining to a waiter who was doing a startling impression of Manuel(from the famous British sitcom Fawlty Towers)ie.pretending that he couldnt understand English. Save your money and give this hotel a wide berth !,Ruralbird
UR121518654,2011-8-December,This hotel was absolutely filthy the rooms was disgusting. Pure filth. Avoid at all costs!!!,Stephen1005
UR117787549,2011-7-September,What a dump. I wouldn't even ask my dog to stay here! First room they gave us was in the basment it stank. Think all they had done to 'clean' it was make the bed. There were hairs on the beches and carpets were not clean no external light etc. Got moved to a room on fourth floor no better. Room was at a slant again not clean. Bath had someones hair still in it. We booked another hoteland checked into it and the staff were unpleasent unhelpful and uninterested which suggeste we weren't the first to do what we did!!!!,dieseldave1983
UR115124495,2011-7-July,We stayed here for 4 nights in July booked a twin and double room. We arrived and were told we have 2 twin rooms they were apolgetic about the mistake and said we could have the double room from the 2nd night onwards not a big deal. The staff (aside from the gentleman who booked us in) were so rude they answered the phone whilst you were talking to them then put their hand up in your face to stop you talking they were incredibly inpatient and unhelpful. If you asked them to re-explain directions they huffed at you and rolled their eyes. Not impressed at all. Rooms were very basic plastic cups for your tea and paper bathmats nothing special. The rooms were cleaned each day though which was good. There were no irons or fans and they asked you to pay a 20 deposit for each of these items! I rathered pay a dry cleaner than the hotel considering how rude they were when I asked for an iron and a fan. To say they offer breakfast is false advertising the only food which is part of your room charge is bread rolls and jam even cereal has a charge. We have since dined out for breakfast everyday. Aside from all the negatives it is in a fantastic area and close to shops and restaurants (for you breakfast!). The service needs improving and I don't think the rooms are value for money. I won't be back mainly due to the rude and impatient staff (aside from one man..).,mezbrown
UR116342808,2011-6-August,We stayed here for two nights so the fact the hotel was very basic wasn't too much of a problem. It was near two underground stations although Bayswater was closed when we were there but Queensway was just a little further on. The reception area was nice but it was a different story up in the rooms and corridors. We were on the second floor and the hall carpet was badly stained - not a good look! We were in room 218 and had the devil of a job getting the key to work in the door. It really needs attention! ( I notice previous occupants had the same problem ) The room was basic with three single beds which were reasonably comfortable and although there wasn't much room to move around it was adequate. We had a bath towel each but no hand towels a paper bath mat which was useless and polystyrene cups for the tea and coffee. Continental breakfast was a joke It was tea coffee juice and rolls with jam or butter. Again very basic and on our second morning we went out and had breakfast nearby. The bar was also basic. We went in for a nightcap on our first evening and there was was no atmosphere at all and the barman hung around listening to our conversation which made us feel rather uncomfortable and we ended up going to bed early. The only thing going for it was the location but if you book a budget hotel in London I suppose you should expect it to be basic.,Mrsgetaway
UR91874951,2011-5-January,Unsafe unsanitary and is the farthest thing from a 3-star hotel. Carpets were old worn and and stained. Beds were basically cots with a thin mattress on top of a metal webbing (no box springs). The bathroom was filthy. The doors were operated by skeleton keys (and no I'm not kidding). The leaflet when you check in says "DO NOT LEAVE ANYTHING VALUABLE IN YOUR ROOM". This place makes Motel 6 look like the Ritz and that's a serious statement. Avoid this hotel. Stay somewhere safe. We checked out early took a two night penalty and paid out of pocket for five days elsewhere. That's how bad it was.,mscotthale
UR95083480,2011-31-January,You will be disappointed if you stay at this hotel! The list of things they did wrong is huge. Service was terrible breakfast was minimal (the juice and tea was watered down) paper bath mats in the bathrooms tiny rooms that are old and not maintained poor service if you need their help for anything elevators did not work one day rooms smelled terrible wake up call came 15 minutes late workers are argumentative when you complain can't use the telephone unless you leave a credit card and 50 pounds deposit even for local calls coffee and tea in the room is provided in cheap cups that can't be used. It ruined our trip!,Janet2225
UR94963950,2011-30-January,My wife and I stayed for what should have been a pleasurable "theatre" weekend booked through a "reputable" local travel agentwho had assured my wife (who had organised the weekend as a present" that it was of good quality and close to the theatre. We were disappointed and went to ask for a room change but heard someone else in front of us being told there were no rooms to change as we only had three hours before the show wew were going to was due to start we resogned ourselves to stay. When leaving for the theatre we were aware that the "Circle Line" was not running so asked if the reception could get us a taxi (we had gven ourselves just over an hour to get there) having been told by the travel agent it was a 10 minute walk we worked out on the map that we would not walk it in two hours reception made one phone call (not in English) and told us that it would be a least 40 to 50 minutes before we could get one. We then set out to find a cab and had a 35 minute drive to the theatre it cost us 15.00 each way so not really convenient or close. We wish we had read the reviews before we went everything you read on theses pages other than someone saying it is good value and accomodation is true. Tiny room 4 foot double bed with a plastic sheet under the sheets tiny bathroom had to sit on the toilet side ways to avoid the towel rail with legs under the tiny sink we were on the 4th floor in a tiny attic room the floor sloped there was a tiny step into the room tiny step into the bathroom so small you almosts missed them untill you trip or stubbed your toe. The polystyrene cups and powdered creamer were something else breakfast was the most hostile eating event I have every experienced anywhere little or no English spoken by staff and the "free" breakfast which we could not lose our voucher for was worth missing. I cannot overstress how disappointed you will feel to give any of your hard earned money to this hotel there were a number of foreign visitors at the hotel and it was embaressing to think that they would think this hotel represented the UK.,MikeW1203
UR111374873,2011-3-June,We first stayed at the Bayswater Inn in 2008 and thought it was basic but fairly comfortable. Maybe we were just nave as this was our first overseas trip. Anyway as our hotel couldnt fit us in for the last three nights we decided to go back to the Bayswater Inn. It's in a great location and is on the right side of London for Heathrow. This was probably the worst decision we made on our trip. The hotel is appalling and it is apparent the owners have done nothing to modernise or renew in years. I can forgive the polystyrene cups but to still use the paper bath mats is a joke. Once wet they slip all over the floor risking guests safety. We asked for an extra towel and used that as a bath mat. Other reviews have mentioned the unfriendly reception staff. On this visit the staff member was actually helpful and pleasant. Perhaps he is new to the job. We went up to the room and couldnt open the door with the key. Reception came up and opened it but walked away quickly. The room was totally inadequate. There was a bed shoved against the wall and no space at all for our suitcases. When you are travelling from overseas you dont just have hand luggage. We closed the door quickly and went back to Reception. Luckily the manager gave approval to change the room but I dont think she was too happy about it given the tone (and loudness) of her voice. The next room again couldnt be opened but while my husband was going back to the front desk I was able to unlock the door. Who knew you would need specialist skills to open a lock?? One turn full left and then a hard turn to the right as far as it will go. The room was bigger with two beds a double and single. The curtains were torn the bedspreads and duvets looked as if they hadnt been washed in months and after sitting on the beds we knew a good nights sleep was not going to happen. Any padding in the mattresses had long gone and you could feel every spring. They sagged in the middle which wasnt helped by the fact that they were fold-up beds not real beds. The bathroom was pretty ordinary with an ill-fitting toilet seat that wouldnt stay still. Ive already mentioned those paper bath mats. I hated this hotel and if I had to stay one more night would have moved out at any cost. It truly is horrible and a visit from a hotel inspector is long overdue.,Tripper2Melbourne
UR116229467,2011-3-August,I have stayed at this hotel many times in the past and had always had a positive experience until about three years ago. Located just steps away from two tube stations buses shopping and lots of restaurants this hotel would seem to be the ideal landing spot for a visit to London. However this hotel now caters ONLY to groups and will totally mess up the lives of independent travelers. They will attempt to move you to a less convenient 'sister' hotel that they claim is more posh. The included 'breakfast' consists of a variety of hot brown waters stale rolls and the equivalent of Tang. Fortunately there is a Starbucks nearby. The rooms are OK for London and kept clean. The independent traveler will get a room with a dramatic view of the airshaft. The television sets in every room I have ever stayed in there are pretty awful and will offer up to four channels if you are lucky. Wifi is available in the lobby only and is not free. Fortunately there us a Starbucks Burger King and McDonald's nearby with free Wifi as well as an Internet cafe in the close by Whiteley's center. None of the staff are native English speakers. I keep staying here because of the great location. I am not a sadist however and will no longer recommend this hotel for myself or the average independent traveler.,Bonnieh1048
UR118723823,2011-29-September,My 18 year old daughter on her first night of a month's travel arrived here to be told she did not have a booking and that they were full - she had booked and fully paid for the room 7 weeks earlier! After them finally accepting her reservation and payment proof she was moved to their 'sister hotel' with a promise of fully paid taxi transport to her tour start location (300m from this hotel) at 5.45am the next morning . No taxi was booked and she had to pay for the fare herself. A great intro to the UK. Poor form!,Kylie N
UR118706009,2011-28-September,The Bayswater Inn Hotel is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in!! It is clearly a low end budget establishment which is not what their website would have you believe. I will list the reasons below: *The hotel is smelly and dirty *The "beds" are metal framed camp beds with thin hard mattresses - almost impossible to sleep on I had to put the quilt underneath to get some comfort *The TVs don't work *The rooms are supplied with polystyrene cups to drink tea/coffee - I had to insist the hotel provide me with a proper cup *The windows are not secure can't be locked and my room had a flat roof outside *My room stank the carpet is filthy and the walls are dirty *The bathroom still had remnants of previous occupants (won't go into detail....) *The doors bang with an alarming volume - wakes everyone up if you don't grab the door before it impacts with the frame *The staff are less than helpful and just advised me to complain to my booking agent!!! It was a dreadful stay and I would never go back again. On the plus side it is quite close to Bayswater tube station and the location is quiet.,Ian C
UR101946982,2011-28-March,After stayin here for a couple days I feel the need to express my feelings! I felt as if I was homeless and had been shoved next to the foreign exchange the whole time I was stayin here!! The walls were as thin as paper and the beds made me stratch! It sounded like a herd of elephants upstairs! And my neck felt like it was goin to snap with a floppy thin pillow! The bath mat aswell where do I start it was so thick and fluffy or shall I say far from it! It was made out of paper which is a disgrace. To be honest I think this hotel is an absolute disgrace and it should be shut down by the health inspectors! The matresses are like cotton wool but they have wonderful protectors to save you from those bugs at night! Don't ever stay here!! Unless you want to live like the homeless!!,mygreeneyedcat
UR120906654,2011-22-November,I was really disappointed with this hotel and would definately not recommend it. The room was large but vey tatty with holes in the walls and skirting board. Everywhere was grimy the windows were so dirty that you could hardly see out of them. There was no lock on the inside of the door as it had broken off. None of the windows locked or shut properly. Plastic covered mattresses on tiny beds. Cheap sachets of coffee and polystirene cups - yuk. The toilet leaked and there was a smear of faeces on the wall. Then there was breakfast.....bowls of cereal stacked up and uncovered. Side plates provided to hold your cold scrambelled egg cold sausages and bread rolls. Tinned fruit was also on offer. Coffee was the same cheap sachets of coffee as in the bedroom which you had to make up yourself with a jug of hot water. The dining room had a huge water stain on the ceiling. The only clean part of the hotel was the foyer. The only good thing was the location.,mandajaneb
UR104959024,2011-21-April,well theplace looked good on the internet - but were those photos actually taken at that hotel? well it was cheap but you'd still expect to get a few hours sleep! ...and it started so well got off the tube at Bayswater family included did not really know the route to the hotel made a quick phone call and recieved perfect guidance great part of London to. Reception looked okay then it began. Firstly room was double booked so they found another room interior dated room terrible you can feel the springs in the matress when you lie down the room spelt really bad the taps would not turn off in the bathroom the tv did not work - it was just grotty. Bedtime arrived and passed. the noise in the hotel was unreal eveytime anyone in the hotel above us moved the entire floor creaked and groaned and the noise from other guests was nothing like I had come across before I rang reception at 02:30 - which was a total waste of time as the operator did not speak very good english - but nothing was done and my body finally gave in about half four as the singing dancing and joyfull celebrations carried on. I would not suggest anyone goes to this hotel and for the same price you can get a better standard of hotel around Russel Square and any of the Imperial Hotel family would out shine this hotel. Sorry guys - but don't waste your London experience here!,HolidayUSA
UR118353709,2011-20-September,Many of the staff were off-hand giving the impression that you were an unwelcome distraction (although one guy did smile when he said he hoped we had had a nice stay). On check-in we were handed a crude photocopy of the hotel 'rules' adding to the 'social security' vibe. Don't get your hopes up about the 'free breakfast' - it's a bowl of rice crispies cup of tea/bad coffee toast and bread rolls. We gave it a miss on day two and went to a nearby cafe the Byzantium instead. The room was depressing had been fitted out some time in the late 70's/80's. The TV was tiny the remote didn't work the ceiling light was an office-style 'tile' in a horrible lowered ceiling. The complementary tea bags were tasteless. The bathmat was a piece of paper with 'bath mat' printed on it(!) The shower was fixed to the wall and unmovable. Really this hotel is not aiming for any repeat business and is focussed on fooling people into paying to stay there while making the bare minimum effort and maximising profits.,innesm
UR116981047,2011-20-August,On appearance to the reception it looked okay but once inside the bedrooms it was a different story the carpets are dirty and stained and the curtains are the same to. The bathroom shower did not work it just gave you cold water during the night i got up to go to the toilet and a cockroach was walking along the bathroom floor. The beds are terrible they need completely renewing one of the beds if you can call it that was a plank of wood and a paper thin mattress basically the beds looked about 30 years old no one got any sleep so the next day we we really tired. One thing the sheets were clean but the were very old. Overall the bedroom was unrateable i would class it as a youth hostel not a 3 star hotel. The breakfast was okay a bit un-organised you had to wait for things to cook and get sorted at one point i was waiting 5 minutes just for a glass of WARM orangejuice. BASICALLY DONT COME HERE IT WAS TERRIBLE we left the next day to book into the premier inn kensington i would recomend there THANK GOOD WE DID AS THE PREMIER INN WAS LOVELY!!!!,Alaine345
UR95320842,2011-2-February,My husband booked this for my 40th and we went with our two young children. On arrival all seemed nice I was expecting something special as the travel agents had told the hotel it was my 40th but there was no mention of this wasnt that bothered but it would have been nice if it was mentioned. The rooms were very basic there were these plastic cups for the drinks. The fittings were shabby the hot water from the tap was a trickle so had to fill the sink up using the water from the bath tap and one of the plastic cups. There was human excrement on the toilet seat when my young son lifted it up to use the toilet!!! The bathroon was like a shoe box. The room was pretty warm but I woke up with a headache each morning and I wished that I had brought a carbon monoxide reader with me! It was quiet were we were so that was ok. The telly has a blue strip down the side when we watched anything. We discovered that the on our card the date of departure was earlier then the date we checked in!! but that was sorted. It stated that free wifi was available but was not had to pay 10.00. There was one arrogant male staff member with ginger hair who was absolutely so so rude to my husband when he said he didnt have his breakfast card to get our key back after an evening out I was surprised how my husband kept his cool. On the plus side I liked the breakfast but my husband thought the way it was organised was a bad set up. He opened the teapot to find about fifty teabags in it which looked as though fresh ones had been chucked on top of used ones many times. I didnt have a cup of tea. The orange juice looked like dirty dishwater. Would not even recommend this to Frank Gallagher!!!,shanierock
UR114317913,2011-19-June,First the good news clean sheets fluffy towels .Thats it.The bad news.Artex in dirty white colour curtains that would not draw fully across.wallpaper hanging off walls in bathroom.Mould around bath (room 427) obviously never heard of bleach when cleaning.A paper bath mat (what help is that ?).Polystrene cups for coffee !.Breakfast was a nightmare had to give order on piece of paper to manager . Basic quality when it finally arrived.Receptionist was wearing dirty off white shirt with tie half way down to waist.Yes we made a mistake going 3 star instead of our normal 4.This is probably not worth a 2 star .I have advised Superbreaks with whom the hotel was booked to investigate.It is jeopardising their reputation.This is not a hotel in the true sense of the word it is a hostel .Not even think of going there,tonyandandrea
UR115392819,2011-15-July,I recently stayed at the Bayswater Inn when I was on a journey with my school. It was an awful hotel to say the least. When we walked into the lobby it looked clean and tidy so I thought it was going good so far. Then we got given our keys and headed up the stairs. As soon as we reached the bottom of the stairs we could smell and dirty smell that was really unpleasant. Then we got up to our room (218) on the second floor and could not get the key to open the door. No matter how much we twisted and turned it we could not get it to open so we had to get a member of staff to help us. Once inside the room was not up to our expectations. There were 4 girls in my group and the room consisted of 3 single beds and one camp bed where the springs had broken and the matress was torn. There was even blood and stains all over my quilt cover so obviously it had not been washed in a few years!! Then we noticed that there were paper bath mats that were competely useless and only polistirine cups to have tea/coffee etc! The room was a long but thin rectangular shape so we had no room to move - if two of us were walking past eachother in the space one would have to stop to let the other past - it was that bad. Even the electrical plugs were awful one of the girls in my room tried to turn her straighters on and the plug made them blow up! The hairdryer was also pathetic if at all you are staying here bring one of your own. In our room the fan in the bathroom was broken. We were 4 teenage girls staying in a room we all had to shower every morning and the bathroom was all steamed up it felt like it was around 90 degrees when it was the last persons turn to go in. At night we ended up pushing two of the single beds together whilst putting the camp bed matress on top in the middle and 3 of s slept in these 2 single beds - not acceptable!! I would have to say that the worst part of the hotel service was the breakfast it was absolutely awful. The hotel advertises that it is a "Continental Breakfast" but I can assure you for a fact that it is far from it. All we got served was a bread roll with butter and jam. That was it. We noticed that some guests were eating bacon eggs toast cereal sausages etc but then we found out that they had to pay for them (2 for 3 sausages!) What a rip off!! We ended up just going hungry until we got something decent to eat at lunch time. I think the only good thing about this hotel is that there was a MacDonalds and a Tesco Express shop at the end of the road so this is the place to go if you want to have something to eat. To be honest I think sleeping in a cardboard box would make you feel more at home!!,CherryBombPow
UR121748512,2011-14-December,Avoid this hotel. It is disgusting and dirty! There was blood on the bedspread!! I called to the front desk to let them know about the unclean linen and they could have cared less. I asked them to bring me a fresh one and they said no if I wanted a new one I'd have to come get it. So I went with the bloody linen to the front desk where a extremely rude front desk clerk proceeded to answer the phone while I was talking. I told him in an extremely loud voice that I was talking to him first and how dare he answer a call in the middle of me talking. I told him that the soiled linen was unexceptionable (still talking loud) which seemed to get his attention since the whole lobby had silenced to listen to my outburst. I finally got a clean blanket. Too make matters worse there was little heat in the room (we were there in November). The bed size that we booked was suppose to be a queen it turned out to be a little larger than a twin bed and short too. Thankfully I my friend and I are 5'5'' and under otherwise we would have been too tall for the bed. I was also thankful that I was staying with my best friend of 20 years since we had to sleep like sardines! The window was greyed out and didn't open which was very strange. Breakfast was a small bread roll and jam. Everything else was extra and over priced! All in all do not waste your time or your money on this dump!,Christina R
UR118059191,2011-13-September,If you have no choice then go for this Hotel too cramoed room for you to fit in alongwith your super bag and if you've got a kid too fit in then. God help you. The location was the only advantage else the hotel would not be the one I would like to return again to. Rather choose to stay a bit far off near any tube so that accessability to central london is taken care of,Praatik
UR100051150,2011-13-March,As a lone female traveller I felt quite threatened by the gangs of loud young people wandering around the corridors and occupying the lifts. I work with students so am usually not intimidated by their behaviour. The hotel was noisy was like a poorly run youth hostel with basic amenities barely adequate breakfast and basic supplies in the rooms. Thank goodness I was only staying one night never again,academicsoo
UR107993549,2011-12-May,I have my beloved hotel in London - vancouver studios - but it was busy. So I booked through hotelbed.com this this hotel. When I arrived there they told me "sorry overbooking we move you in another hotel in another part of London". I refused to be moved as they accepted people that came after me because they were in double and I had a single. I spole with hotelbeds.com and they were very professional so after 1 hour I had the room. Windows with big cut on it no shower bath no towel/carpet in the shower but a piece of paper where to put the wet feet no air conditioning. People at the reception are terrible (the small blond boy speaks as a computer: yes mom take a sit mom overbooking mom") the woman I met understood the problem and was very nice. once I told them "I am calling the police as overbooking is illegale if you accept a pre payment" they were very impressed and they gave me a double instead of a single. I have seen many people complaining for the rooms.,teresabattista
UR74395069,2010-9-August,I booked this hotel at the last minute for a weekend in London. On arriving the receptionist ignored me to speak to her friend. She then couldn't find our room on the guest list and told us that they didn't have a room for us despite confirming it on the phone the day before! They ordered a taxi to take us to our new hotel and sent us half way across London to the WRONG hotel finally ending up 2 hours later at the Park Inn in Lancaster Gate. My recommendation - pay a little extra and stay at the Park Inn instead! Far nicer cleaner and excellent breakfast. Bayswater Inn is a bitter disappointment.,chegwin
UR89313456,2010-8-December,This hotel went beyond all the borders of my understanding of a bad hotel. Nothing was even close to acceptable: the staff is incompetent and unhelpful they are good at making things even more complicated for their guests (if it is possible to feel like a guest at all) the management never had time to talk to us during 3 days of your stay and the only way to communicate via e-mail the madras was warned out you could feel the structure of the bed directly in your body the bath was out of function. The wireless internet costs GBP 5 pr hour and is available only in the lobby (difficult to believe it is possible in 2010 in London)! The whole property is unmaintained and looks "tired and bored". The thing they call "continental breakfast" consists of tea coffee toast (that you have to ask for) butter and jam NOTHING else! Conclusion! Dont go there if you have a little respect for your money for that place is not worth even a penny!,NairaOsl0
UR55399064,2010-7-February,Hotel staff friendly and polite that is the only good point. The room was tatty to say the least. Carpets dirty Bed covers unclean sheets clean but bed seen better days. There was a kettle which had to be switched off at the mains as the on/off switch broken. Cups provided but were polystyrene. Powder milk tea bags and coffee. The bathroom had very hot water however toilet stained. Only two hand towels and two soaps provided no shampoo. There was a TV in the room but reception poor. TV old not modern. Advertised as refurbished quite clearly this not the case. Breakfast consisted of breadroll and jam coffee and tea.,SouthwalesToad
UR86203272,2010-6-November,The room was tiny although classed as a standard and the bed was only 3/4 pushed against the wall to make the room look larger. Even the toilet was difficult to sit on because of the heated towel rail It was near the lift which seemed to be operating all night with excessive noise. The staff spoke many languages but for most English was at best their second language. Breakfast was a Continental (allegedly) not a croissant or cooked meat in sight english rolls and strawberry jam.,m50lws
UR69770080,2010-5-July,Good points-location is very central however despite being situated on Princes Square it was difficult to get a quiet nights sleep. Plenty of bars and restaurants nearby which made the holiday for us. Facilities in the hotel were disappointing-their ad claims it has a "peaceful coffee shop restaurant and bar" No coffee shop that I coiuld find-there is one dining area which provided breakfast and doubles as a very lacklustre bar in the evenings. Even this was not open on Saturday (despite being advertised as such) Breakfasts were poor-tea grey coloured juice watered down and only rolls or toast on offer. Rooms were dated and in need of TLC. Paint peeling bath chipped stained carpets! No milk for the two wee teabags provided except dried milk sachets. Certainly no shampoo on offer. it was also so hot while we were there we could not sleep-windows opened marginally at top of otherwise fixed window. Do not attempt to stay there in summer! Only plus points within hotel iteslf-friendly staff (except one who snapped at us first morning when I asked for toast) and it was kept very clean.,glesgagalGlasgow
UR63239367,2010-4-May,I had only stayed at this hotel because it was my birthday and I bought tickets to go and see the lion king at the lyceum theatre. The hotel was included as a deal. I didn't think about reading reviews on the hotel before i booked because you would think it would be up to a high stardard as it is linked with a theatre. BUT I WAS VERY WRONG! The service was very poor We weren't showen to our room. Our room was the last room on the 4th floor. The room was very basic the toilet seat was all cracked and chipped the shower looked as old as me! And the beds weren't vey comfortable. Breakfast- continental there was a bread roll ( that looked like it had seen better days) toast that was so crunchy and cold ( like it had been cooked and left on the side) cups of tea or coffee that tasted over bruedAs well as this you could pay extra for either a egg sausage or bacon. Which was at a really high cost. It was also twice as hard to get any service because none of the waiters could speak english or understand us. This stay at this hotel really ruined it for me I was so thankful that i was only staying here for one night. I will be ALOT MORE CAREFUL the next time i choose where to stay in london!!! My one tip is STAY AWAY FROM THIS HOTEL!!,Cerryberry
UR77088072,2010-27-August,well i went to stay at this hotel with my family and we got there and the people at the reseption were rude to us and we gave them our confirmation letter as we had pre - booked over the phone and the man at the reseption had a smerk on his face and said we have a little problem so we asked what and he told us that they were fully booked and we would have to be moved to another hotel and we would have to pay for the taxi to get there but in the end we manged to get them to pay for the taxi but it was so fustrating as we had booked a show for that night and by the time they had sorted everything it was nearly time for it to start and we had not even left luckly we got there in time ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh stressfull or what.,jady--15
UR68722786,2010-26-June,We went on a tour with EF Tours- the hotel was beautiful from the outside and the lobby not bad but the rooms were dated and not up to my usual standards. The breakfast was toast and jam coffee tea and juice. Our american teenager were a little disappointed. The hotel was over run with tour groups from all over the world many of teenagers not very well behaved. I was traveling with a large group of Girl Scout (most of which were very well behaved). There is a small restraunt/bar where the severs were nice but the manager (old lady) was not very customer friendly and could not wait for people to leave. This is very centrally located close to the underground. Most local places stop serving food very early and because it is in a residential area the pubs close early. If you are looking for well located budgeted hotel this is the place for you- but you get what you pay for.,penguin28173
UR72418458,2010-26-July,I think any one who has rated this hotel higher than 1 out 5 must have come inside 'plants'. By the way I tried to give 0 out of 5 but Trip Advisor insists on 1 at least. Indeed a single pot plant would have been more efficient and helpful than any of the staff we came in to contact with. The room was abismal - completely filthy with ants mould and a leaking ceiling. I am now safely back home but still so itchy I have just googled bedbugs and human fleas. With a window that wouldn't open and no air conditioning we borrowed a filthy fan which was caked in so much detritus I was afraid to turn it on - and only needed to give a 20 deposit. I read somewhere that this hotel was completely renovated in 2002 1902 would be closer to the reality.,Jo12331
UR54441390,2010-26-January,we stayed for 2 nights and found that the tube is only five minutes away so good links for our nights out. made use of tea making facilities in our roomaltho kettle was dangerous and did not stop boiling-faulty button meant too hot to pick up. breakfast very very poor. consisted of freezer pack rollsbutterjamevidence of toast but none was available. not enough towels bath mat useless as made of paper. friendly staff considering the amount of complaining guests we saw moaning at them. overall not great hotel but good location and fairly good price for central london.,giraffe203
UR80585652,2010-22-September,Yes all the bad reviews are completely accurate. Better than sleeping on the street. But nothing else in its favour. Truely ghastly. Thank goodness was for only one night. Booked via Last Minute. We tried to get moved.. really really tried.. but all they could offer was a hotel in Hertfordshire! London was full up. Ha ha! Theatre was bad too. Walked out after first act!,JoBo04
UR59285012,2010-22-March,Had to wait in lobby for 3 hours for room to be cleaned. They knew our arrival time because of call from our travel agent the day before. Desk reception had a bad attitude and not at all helpful. Room was clean but spartan. No handtowels or washcloths available.(paper bath mat) Only 2 tiny bars of soap left without any being added for the week. Beds were thin and the plastic could be felt and heard every time you moved. They did not change sheets daily! The TV worked only some time and the remote was filthy and was scotched taped to hold in the batteries. The coffee pot did not heat up. The elevator only worked for half the week. We got stuck in it 2 times between floors. No heat! The lobby bathroom flushed only sometimes. The continental breakfast consisted of dry rolls bad coffee and watered down orange juice.,sjones0304
UR54106341,2010-22-January,Hotel decor poor lots of chipwood paper painted cream. Room basic beds low but bedding clean and room warm. Shower sprayed over shower curtain onto bathroom floor. View from window looked into small square with brick walls on three sides. No coffee lounge as advertised no bar as advertised told we could go to local bar on corner. Breakfast consisted of breadroll with jam and butter one jug of orange tea[which ran out regularly] coffee or chocolate. Cooked breakfast was cold and when sent back was heated in microwave. Grilled tomatoes when ordered came as a half cold raw tomato on plate. Too far away from theatres last year we stayed in Russell Square which was more central and we walked back to hotel this hotel cost us 25 in taxi fare. Was sold to us as just off Oxford Street.....WRONG. Sorry but I would not go back to this hotel again.,tess&pen
UR80400336,2010-21-September,Bad size BASEMENT room polystyrene cups which I hate powdered cream to go with the tea a paper bath mat tiny bath towels and for that to come from a 5ft size 10 women says it all tiny single beds. So thats the room. Have no expectations for breakfast. As many of the about comments have stated its bread rollsjam and cereal. If you ask for toast from any of the staff that don't speak English expect to wait. I was discusted by this!! Location. Well we bought this as a theatre break package. It took us 45mins to get to our theatre Which made us 30 mind late. I can't think of any good to say about this hotel. If you have to pay more than 20 for this hotel DONT BOOK IT!!"",lil1977
UR58886748,2010-18-March,Summary: If you want somewhere just to get your head down it is cheap. If you intend spending anytime in your room awake look elsewhere. I stayed here for one night in March. The receptionist on duty was pleasant and I was checked in quickly. I asked about parking outside and was told it was free between 6:30pm and 8:30pm. What I wasn't told was that there were building works going on so parking had been restricted....end result and 120 parking fine! Hotel could have made me aware. The room was basic and small. TV worked but only had a few channels. Breakfast was described as continental but was only bread rolls jam and butter. Staff were very surly on reception and dining room in the morning.,symbol_soup
UR64365865,2010-17-May,Stayed in this hotel for 3 nights with friends for a weekend of Londons sights .Location was excellent. On arrival checked into our room which was 2 levels below ground no sunlight  damp smell and we could tocuh the ceiling (at 5ft tall). Insisted on a room change at least on ground level as it was like being in a dungeon !!!! We were asked to vacate the room by 11am the following morning where we were then made wait until 3pm to be given a second room on level 2.. basic but clean and major improvment on first nights stay. Staff were extremly unhelpful and breakfast ??? what breaksfast a roll and tea .. Would never stay again or recommended this hotel it shouldnt even be rated!!,pinklady001
UR67683660,2010-16-June,One star is to much. Bad beds rooms breakfast and anything else that could come to mind. The only thing going for it is location. Please check Best Western just down the street. Everything the Bayswater pretends to be. We Stayed via Gateone for four nights. Gateone is reveiwing.,dgala48
UR56023857,2010-15-February,Don't book this hotel very very basic room was small with the window lock broken so the room was not secure when you went out. Plastic cups in room with no shampoo or gell. The breakfast was poor with very little choice. The hotel is in need of a coat of paint with the rooms looking dirty. the bed was old and worn so bad that you rolled into the middle so nether of us got a good nights sleep. On Sat night we returned at 20.00 to have a drink in the bar to be told that it was shut due to it being a football day ???. The only plus for the hotel is location. The staff are polite but not over frendly. All in all I would not recommend this hotel to anybody.,FredSwindon
UR83427020,2010-14-October,THe hotel had a fantastic location right next to the station of Bayswater. Otherwise the breakfast sucked really badly. The bed were not at all comfortable and the rooms were like a mouse hole. Not all value for money. Moreover when we complained about the bed they refused to change the room as they did not have any even though we saw fresh people come in.,AbhishekBagri
UR58553365,2010-14-March,The moment we arrived the service was terrible there was a large group of us and they didnt know what rooms they had for us. so it took an hour to accommodate us We were put in a triple instead of a twin and then were told we had to be moved the next morning. the continental breakfast involved 2 different types of semi stale bread rolls some jams and butter and orange juice that tasted more like onions. Both lifts broke on the last day but you weren't to know that if you were on a floor other than the reception. You have to pay for internet and they had the cheek to remove my laptop from my room and also my friends mobile phone. The only good point to the hotel is the location.,hepziirae
UR55947505,2010-14-February,This hotel seemed to be very good value but after staying here we would gladly pay more for a better hotel. Firstly we could not get into our room as the key seemed jammed. When we finally got in it was very small ( a larger person would struggle in it). For drinks it was polystrene cups the television only had 3 channels and there was no shampoo or shower gel. The toilet leaked and it was in very bad condition. The paper bath mat was useless and when you had a shower the water did not go down the bath !! The breakfast was terrible just 2 types of basic bread rolls jam and tea/coffee/ hot chocolate. The seating area was too small and the moment you nearly finished the plate somebody came to take your plate away pressuring you to get up. We had to get breakfast elsewhere. The late night so called bar had no atmosphere noboby wanted to drink there and it was expensive. It was meant to be open until 12 but by 11pm they were ready to thow you out even though you've only had a couple of drinks. We enjoyed London but would not come back to this hotel again.,covkid_10
UR67416673,2010-13-June,Barely two star definitely not 3 as promised on the website. Staying at Bayswater Inn was like sleeping on a ladder in a wonky caravan or hostel. Positive was the good shower and pleasant office staff but we cancelled after a second night on the racks and moved to the much better and cheaper Grand Royal Hotel (or Penbridge Palace) a few streets over.,christasman
UR83144289,2010-12-October,My booking was made 07/08/10. After a long day travelling I arrived at the hotel. Eventually attended to only to be told they were moving me to another hotel. They would get me a taxi. I was not told why or which hotel I was being transfered to. I ha to ask. The hotel I was transfered to was the Troy Hotel. I had the worst stay in any hotel I have ever experienced. I would not recommend either of these hotels no matter how cheap they are.,jenniferbonnie
UR67304109,2010-12-June,The location is great as notting hill is a lovely suburb and next door to kensington. The hotel is very poor. Our room was below ground level it felt like we were in the basement. The room had 1 tiny window it was a dark damp room. The breakfast was ridiculous breadrolls tea/coffee juice. I ordered some srambled eggs one morning as I was hungrey but it was discusting. Staff unfriendly. Great location pity about the hotel. I would not stay there again.,TraceyNZ1
UR58224877,2010-10-March,i went out on my first day and came back to my hotel room which was cleaned by room service and found jewellery missing from my jewellery box. They stole my necklace and earrings that were a birthday present from my father. when i asked reception all they did was say sorry the cleaning person doesnt know anything about this.,emmo72000
UR69286545,2010-1-July,We booked a mini break to London with Superbreak through Bath travel this hotel was classed as a 3 star hotel with full english breakfast. The room was badly in need of decoration the bed sheets were ripped and the bed so uncomfortable that I slept on the floor. The walls were paper thin and we could hear other room doors constantly banging all night. The English breakfast consisted of 1 rash of bacon and 1 egg OR 1 sausage and 1 egg which you had to order!. Fine if your a student and want something basic (but sure theres better out there for the price) def not a place for familys.,magic112
UR23395042,2009-9-January,Breakfast wasn't very exciting. The website says breakfast is included but they forget to say what that includes: piece of bread jam and water orange juice tea or coffee. If you want a traditional english breakfast that will be an extra fee. We got stuck in the basement. It wasn't the most satisfying place but we were comfortable. At night you can hear all the noises around you the toilets flushing people walking and random doors slamming. The toilet in our room was okay. There was hot water one night but another day there was very little hot water. The toilet also took a couple of attempts to flush... The lift was terrible and we couldn't find the stairs. The lift on one of the occasions actually stopped and wouldn't open. We managed to get out but it's never happened to me. My advice be patient. The people were friendly and we didn't have any problems with room service. They made our beds every day. You get what you pay for!,qkebt147
UR29612457,2009-8-May,Me and my mom spent 6 nights at this hotel. When we booked at the travel agency in Sweden we asked not to get a room on the lower ground (souterrain) if possible. Unfortunately when we arrived it still turned out to be such a room. At first we couldn't find the room so we had to ask the staff. It appeared that the room was situated in a corridor with a sign that said "Staff only". No wonder we couldn't find it! The room was very small and very hot. You could hardly move yourself in there. On top of the mattress there was some kind of plastic cover. That made it rustle and in the morning you woke up totally sweaty. The bath mat was a small piece of paper to no avail. There were no handtowels only bodytowels. One day when we had become clean towels there were brown stains on one of them! Disgusting! If they couldn't remove the stains in the laundry why give them to the guests? There was also a very disturbing buzzing sound from the walls. It seemed as it occurred everytime someone had been to the bathroom and it lasted around 10-15 minutes. Once there was a terrible smell when we passed through the corridor it was so bad that one of us almost vomited. We're used to many kind of smells but this was really disgusting. It was NOT from cleaning products. The absolute worst thing was the breakfast. We had ordered continental breakfast. It consisted of: coffee tea juice too soft french breads (almost wet inside) and marmalade. That was it! They had some other things too but not much AND you had to pay extra for it. It was a big joke! We never were satisfied enough so we had to buy something extra to eat in a store nearby. However the staff was very friendly and helpful and the hotel is situated in a very nice area. Still we wouldn't recommend this hotel. It's a very low standard for being a 3 star hotel. It's only worth 2 stars. Jenny and Eva from Sweden,Tourist_Sweden
UR31890537,2009-8-June,I got back from London yesterday and I had to write a review here already. My experience wasn't as bad as the other reviews I've read. I stayed in Room 19 with family so we had 3 single beds. Our window looked out to a wall. If I was told I was staying at a Hostel I wouldn't have been disappointed. However I was told this was a 3 star hotel so I EXPECT 3 star hotel amenities. I have no idea how a hotel like the Bayswater Inn can be classified as a 3 star hotel because I've stayed in many 3 star hotels in my lifetime and Bayswater Inn is THE WORST 3 STAR hotel I've ever stayed in. To review this hotel as a HOSTEL I had no issues. This HOSTEL is everything I would've expected. To review this hotel as a 3 star Hotel I have many issues. First of all what the heck was on the beds? Some kind of plastic cover? The TV remote barely worked. The bath mat was a piece of paper with foot prints on it. There were no hand towels just regular bath towels. The room was so small with the 3 suitcases we barely had enough room to walk around without pretending we're in an obstacle course. On top of that there was no AC. Luckily it was cold the 3 nights we were there so AC wasn't required. As for the breakfast I thought you at least get free eggs in a contintental breakfast. This is the only continental breakfast I've ever had where all they served were Buns Orange Juice Water Jam and Butter. Everything else you had to pay for. Seriously who did they pay off to get a 3 star rating the nicest part of the whole complex was the freaken Lobby the rest of the hotel was a dump. There is no way this is a 3 star hotel NOT EVEN CLOSE. I stayed in a 3 star hotel just a week before in Dubai that after staying in Bayswater the 3 star hotel in Dubai felt like a 5 star hotel. Absolutely ridiculous. DO NOT stay in this hotel if you expect 3 star service/amenites because you will be thoroughly disappointed and feel ripped off. If you expect Hostel atmosphere/amenities/service by all means stay here. It's central to many areas and it's cozy enough that you get what you need out of a hostel and that's to SLEEP and SHOWER.,Bestbeancounter
UR24261961,2009-5-February,Do not stay here! My family got sucked into this hotel thru Virgin Vacations (airfare & hotel package deal) By the time I looked up the Bayswater on trip advisor it was too late. So I kinda knew what we were getting into but here's my 2cents anyway. As everyone else said....Completely (4/5 of them) rude & unhelpful staff. Breakfast was a JOKE. The mildew smell in the rooms & hallways I can't even describe it. Our toilet seat was not connected to the toilet but hanging off by a hinge. Windows would not open. The BEDS! Those might have been the most uncomfortable things I have ever slept on. Camping out in the mountains is comfier. The shower clogged and filled up to right below my knees everytime and flooded the bathroom floor. The remote for the television had tape wrapped around it to keep it together (hilarious). The towels smelled dirty. I asked the housekeeping staff NOT to make my bed (as I brought my own sheets and wanted to do it myself everyday) yet they proceeded to take my 50lb suitcase off my bed to make it anyway. Yes the tube was close but that doesn't make up for anything. That's pretty much all I want to get into for right now. Moral of the story......DON'T even think about considering this INN for ANY reason.,JoeyJean10
UR36699903,2009-4-August,On the internet the hotel looks very good and also the woman on the phone was very helpful and answered all my questions. The location of the hotel is very good for a city trip. It's just a few minutes walk to the tube. I booked a special offer rate which was not too bad for a London city hotel but for the price we would have expected more. Our rooms (we had two) were in the basement. Very dark and not very friendly looking. The bathroom urgently needs refurbishing it seem that it can't get totally clean anymore. The temperature of the shower seemed to be connected to the force of the water coming out so showering without washing your hair wasn't possible because warm water ment a flood coming down the showerhead. The breakfast was ridiculous. We had continental breakfast included. What it was: a breadroll butter and jam. Nothing else. And the coffee and hot chocolate were both not good. We were very disappointed and after the first night we didn't really want to go back there...,Nemo87
UR24061854,2009-31-January,Firstly i would advise anyone reading this NOT! to stay at the Baywater Inn Hotel. I am not usually one to write poor reviews however I can definately make an exception as i would like to warn people for their benefit. When looking for a hotel in London I thought this was the best option for me personaly as the price was low (20.00 a night) and the reviews where adverage however when arriving at the hotel the staff where unhelpful. But this wasnt the start of our problems. I stayed at the hotel with my boyfriend and a cople of friends as the stay was only for one night i didnt make too much of a fuss however if i would have been there any longer this wouldnt have been the case. When booking we where told that my boyfriend and I would have a double and this wasnt the case as we where given 2 singles. After asking politely for this to be amended there was a long wait for the room to be changed. Another reason I was unsure of our room was due to the unlockable door as this made me feel unsafe. Once the room was changed I was quite happy as the room was a double and there didnt seem to be any problems (Boy was I wrong). After unpacking our bags we left the hotel for the evening. When returning to our room we where overwelmed with the worst smell you can possibly imagine this had obviously been covered before we entered our room previously as when first arriving there was a fresh smell of air freshner. The smell was so intense I gagged and nearly vomited (I appologise for being so graffic but i need to warn you of the conditions). After explaining this to the receptionist I was given can of air freshner (barely enough for one spray of the room) and told to use this and open the window. This shocked me as the smell was clearly there to stay. Trying to make do with the smell wasnt the last our problems. The bed covers where dirty and clearly hadnt been changed. As by this point we were tired so to get some rest we slept on top of the covers as there was no way i would have subjected myself to sleeping under the covers. I stayed in the clothes i was wearing as i was concerned about the cleanlyness of the beds however my legs wernt covered as i was wearing shorts. I was woken up at 1am to the sound of someone trying to open our bedroom door this was alarming to think that people would try to enter your room when your sleeping. At 7am the door was opened using a key and closed again  however this could have been someone leaving as I only woke up as the door was closing. It was hard enough trying to sleep after the first time the door was trying to be opened but at this point i couldnt stay any longer. I and my boyfriend left as soon as we could not staying for the breakfast of a bread roll and orange juce as by this point there wouldnt have been anything to keep us there. Also after leaving the hotel I noticed an awful rash had apeared on my legs overnight and was increadibly ichy and sore. This worried me as it had appeared whislt staying at Bayswater Inn hotel. Even now a couple of days after staying there the rash is still on my legs and is still causing me discomfort. Please for your own sake do not stay at The Bayswater Inn Hotel and if you do make sure you take something to block you nose with and a sleeping bag.,Bailys-Fan
UR50371021,2009-30-November,Reception staff where polite but demoralised by the constant barrage of unhappy customers complaints and demanding there money back. The dining room seem to have know training at all it was like they had all started that morning it was just chaos. The location was good local to the bus routes and underground and a quite square. The reception area was clean but needed up dating however once out of the reception area you where confronted by heavily stained carpets and the very poorly maintained state of the hotel. The rooms where very dated and in a poor state with broken furniture the door lock was broken as well as number of other things the linen was clean however because of the general state of the room i cant say felt at home or comfortable in the rooms. The worst and most dangerous fault was on opening the draws between the beds dangling in the draws where live electrics which where uninsulated and a real threat to life. Cant say i ever complain about anything but really you will ruin your break if you stay here this is not a cheap hotel and it just strikes me that the owners of this hotel are taking there guests for a ride and will continue all the time they can get away with it and clearly dont care. They have staffed the hotel with people who have probably never had a days training who they obviously dont care about either and i think thats who i probably feel sorry for!!!!,SparkySparky
UR52188876,2009-30-December,Romm was last decorated in the 60's double bed was only a large singlem no shampoo shower gel and only 1 towel. The rooom sloped in every direction!! The sheets were clean though the bathroom wasn't the best. Advertised as bed and continental breakfast!!!which consisted of toast roll and jam with tea and awful orange juice. The place was very noisy and you could hear doors banging and people talking all night. This was the most basic hotel which had a good location for bars and restaurants. I would rather pay a more than stay here again,DalmationLincoln
UR50281108,2009-29-November,after reading the reviews on here i thought it cant be that bad can it? have stayed in hotels that have been slated on here before. boy was i wrong. booked weekend away with friends to see a show had booked 3 double rooms checked in went to rooms and found we all had twin rooms went back to recieption to ask for doubles after long time she came back and said hotel was fully booked so couldnt move rooms(no managers to speak to they all finish at 2.pm) hey lets not it spoil our weekend. back to rooms we go. then the list started. musty smelly rooms and towels one of our rooms opened bed side cabinet and live electrical wires all taped together breakfast was a joke dirty tables had to ask waitress 4 times to clear away the dirty plates even then some one else did it had full english breakfast all six of us ordered at same time and they came out 1 at a time had to wait 40 mins for last breakfast to appear. when you did get your eggs and bacon was stone cold no knifes and forks then joined the que at receiption to complain. i've stayed in much better hostels around the world than this place. deffo do not stay here. had rooms 219 205 & 124. have taken pictures of live wires and have forwarded then to H.S.E,dynamitedun
UR45249390,2009-28-September,Do not stay here. This is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. The room was a triple. The carpet was filthy. The bathroom had black mold around the shower. The bathroom above us dripped into ours. The mattresses were so old all three had sunk in the middle. We had to pile three duvets on each to make them even sleepable. The pillows were so flat we all had to request more. The hotel staff were rude with the exception of some of the desk staff. The "breakfast nazi" that checked the breakfast cards was extremely nasty making Seinfeld's soup nazi seem like a kitten. No card no breakfast room key was not good enough...which was no loss. Breakfast consisted of a cold hard roll horrible coffee and worse orange juice. The "hot chocolate" was weak chocolate water. Three boringBT channels on the TV.,dwallmo
UR23962379,2009-27-January,Ok for this hotel I have not paid too much so if you get really good deal you will have more money to spend on good food. London is not inexpensive city and I wanted to save money. the shower is very small when I wanted to open the shower door I had to leave the bathroom and open the door then I came in and can walk into shower. Yes everything is very old not clean and cheap and yes the service is from hell. but I can not find any other hotel in London where I pay 50 euro and there is bed and toilet included in the room rate. If I pay 49 euro I think I will sleep in the park on the bench.,hexnut
UR35867203,2009-26-July,We were a family of four - my parents myself and my sister. We were assigned a room in basement. The shower floods. The room was boiling - opening the window doesn't help as it is a basement room and all you see is a wall when you open the window. At breakfast it's easily a scene you witness on news report about famine - although with better dressed and healthier looking individuals - hoards of people swarm towards the few bread baskets with bread. If you are lucky you arrive at the breakfast room when they had just refilled the bread baskets and you find bread there. If you don't you mill around the bread baskets until they refill them which could be 5 minutes upwards. d After you'd found your bread you repeat the same procedures with orange juices / coffee / tea / hot choc. The breakfast fills you up... by getting you feeling fed up for having to fight for food you had paid for. We had stayed in one star hotels in Paris with better services. Enough said.,eatingchocolate
UR47391213,2009-21-October,Was given a room in the basementon the way to the room the damp smell was terrible.On entering the room the smell from the previous occupants earlier meal was still presenta small room with a window looking out onto a very small courtyard.Was given another room straight away.The next room on the top floor was bigger but the state of the room was not good(mould in bathroomhairs in the bathrotten windowsbeds very uncomfortable)the need to itch was at times unbearable.A word of warning with future visitors if you have dentures do not bite into the bacon quickly as future dentists bills will be considerabledo not pay for a swim anywhere a dive onto your plate with the amount of oil on it would suffice.PLEASE STAY CLEAR OF THIS HOTEL.,THEROOBOY
UR25426616,2009-2-March,Me and my fiance stayed here for 2nights and when we arrived we got given a room on the lower ground floor with a view of another room got 3 single beds instead of a double bed and all night constantly there was loud footsteps above us backwards and forwards which meant we didnt sleep very well. we were told before we booked that this hotel had recently been refurbished so the rooms had new flat screen tv's and were really nice but we seen no sign of any refurbishments. also our room was right next door to the maids staff room so from about 6am all we could hear was them chatting. luckily enough London was fantastic so we didnt let this ruin our weekend but we were not impressed it is more like a hostel not a hotel so i will not be going bk to this hotel.,panda47

UR47018606,2009-16-October,I was given a room on the street level even a MONK would find offensive They changed my room after one night which was considerably better but hotel is definitely not 3 star perhaps no star would be more appropiate.,NewY0rker38
UR34886478,2009-16-July,A room about the size of a prison cell below ground during a heatwave no a/c and told by reception to keep the window closed because of security concerns. Woken numerous times during the night due to the constant slamming of doors. Glad to leave. Will never stay there again.,Curlee79
UR24618065,2009-16-February,Don't book this hotel. The hotel dishonoured my laterooms reservation on arrival very late at night - leaving me without accommodation. The hotel had processed my bank card pre-authorisation incorrectly (I checked with my bank). The hotel manager said that they had cancelled the reservation but he would not show me the documentation to support that claim (I checked and Laterooms had not received any cancellation from the hotel). The hotel refused to discuss my complaint with Laterooms when they telephoned. The hotel management blamed me despite all of the evidence showing that they had simply made a series of mistakes themselves. Deceitful and incompetent - a sure recipe for failure and customer disappointment.,ColinBe
UR34742359,2009-14-July,When we arrived at Bayswater Inn we were given a room in the basement that was hard to find with a very small window. The room was extremely warm and had no air movement. The toilet handle squirted water when it was flushed and took about 10 minutes to refill. The hardware on the sink spun around when you turned on the water. When we compained to the manager we were told that was all that it was not their best room but that was all they had available. When we asked them to discount the room they miraculously came up with another room - in the basement with a toilet that still took 10 minutes to fill. We were told that that's how the plumbling worked there and there was nothing that could be done.We told them that we would be going elsewhere since their plumbing did not work properly and there was no air movement. In the mean time we were told that the upstairs rooms had airconditioning . Interestingly they came up with another room upstairs that was much larger and the toilet worked. However there was no airconditioning as they had said and it had a funnel shaped cloud of swarming insects over the middle bed that we could not shoo out of the window. They refused to refund our money. Keep in mind that I had two daughers with me that had backpacked around Europe and stayed in hostels for 2 weeks before coming here and that this was the worst place that they had been. Plus one of them is in Peace Corps in a third world country and is used to less than adequate accomodations and she thought that is was unacceptable. We went down the street to a cheaper hotel with working toilets and a better breakfast.,AustinNicole
UR23482152,2009-12-January,I have stayed in better hotels located in third world countries! This hotel should be bull-dozed. I'll sum up......dirty towels paper floor mats polystyrene cups drafty single-glazed windows faulty wiring dirty walls poor TV reception uncomfortable beds 1970's decor and furniture dust and dirt caked surfaces mouldy bathroom suites....... I could go on.......... All in all I would thoroughly recommend you pay a little bit extra and find somewhere else. I paid 40 extra last year and I stayed in the Waldorf.......needless to say it was much much better. If you do stay there........good luck.,kachariw
UR46572984,2009-11-October,Oh my goodness! Do not stay at this hotel I've added photos to support my review. The radiator was hanging off the wall the bath mouldy and dirty the windows were rotting and the beds...well...they just didn't let the terrible state of the place down! We ended up leaving as we'd booked a 'recently refurbished 3* hotel' and this really is not any of that!,sassy_sars
UR14103741,2008-6-March,First of all we arrived earlier than Check in time ( 10Am) THe bad: Front Desk Old lady was trying to check us in but she was VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY RUDE OMG why is she even in the front desk?????? WHY? i kindly asked her how many stars is this hotel and she just said 4 STARS!!! with a slightly loud Tone of voice.... i was like OK fine you win now check us in will ya? then here came the Ops support coz the nice lady couldnt see our reservation apparently... anyways they told us that our room wasnt ready so WE had to store our luggage OURSELVES in their Luggage room. Ok if your a 4 star WHERE THE Heck is the concierge???? they gave us a room in the BAsement. trust me it wasnt a good experience. we didnt manage to complain because we were busy through that time..... Continental Breakfast? by that you mean no hot food right? well we had the coldest Bread Rolls and the coldest coffee and the warmest Orange juice =) too good to be 1* hostel. i dont even remember how we checked out to be honest. this is a -5 out of 10 in terms of rating.,ralphicous
UR12390270,2008-6-January,I had the unfortunate experience of staying in this tip of a place in the beginning of December. The beds are simply the most uncomfortable I have ever stayed on. the "continental breakfast" is a bread roll coffee & vile orange juice. When I complained about the mattress on several occasions nothing was changed until my last night where the mattress was turned over & a piece of wood stuck under one of the legs so the mattress didn't appear to be sloping so heavily. I have made a complaint through my travel booking company only to be informed that there are no reports of any complaints being made. I strongly advise everyone NEVER stay in this hotel as it is truly the worst I have ever stayed in!,Gonga2
UR20612638,2008-4-October,Where do I begin? I am fully aware that accommodation in London is outrageously expensive and you get what you pay for. However I have stayed in a range of budget accommodation in London including university student accommodation youth hostels and B&Bs and this hotel is by far the worst. My single room was located in the basement and was so small that my two suitcases covered the entire floor. And the shower and toilet were located in a cupboard! The room was also located next to a room full of pipes and I heard evey flush of every toilet and every turn of every tap...all night. I didn't even bother to stay for breakfast as judging by the hygene of the rooms I was certain that I would end up with dysentry if I ate there. The carpet in the room was so dirty that I dared not walk on the carpet bare foot in case my feet stuck to the floor! If you are on a budget I recommend that you look at hostels as an alternative to flushing your money down the toilet by staying at this hotel.,stephied26
UR16541598,2008-31-May,The front desk staff were polite & helpful but other areas of the hotel need alot of help especially housekeeping. In the 8 nights that we were there the sheets were never changed in fact the beds were barely made up. The shower was terrible and very dangerous as there was nothing to keep you from slipping in the tub (it was very slippery). The hotel was very noisy with guests slamming doors & talking in the hallways all night long.,Tusitala10
UR17367865,2008-30-June,Not great. Location is good (short walk to Kensington Palace) and the price is nice but I got stuck into a basement room...not nice at all. It felt like an old workroom that had been converted to a hotel room. Right next to the building's pipes (so I heard every flush) cracked tile leaky faucets stained coverlets. I know I know you get what you pay for but STILL. Perhaps some of the rooms upstairs are nicer; some of the other reviews seem to indicate so. Staff was friendly. I didn't spend much time there anyway; just slept and bathed.,moghedien
UR14760778,2008-3-April,Found the room very small and with no view at all. As I had booked last October I expected a better room. The breakfast for which I was charged 9.00 per person was actually only 7.00 per person on the menu. The bar was very good but was shut on the Wednesday night. The television reception was rubbish. I have written to the hotel twice since last Saturday but as yet have had no reply.,Prestonian2
UR21369185,2008-29-October,The hotel where the toilet doesn't flush because the floor slops. The hotel where your feet are higher then your head because the floor slops. A dirty kettle broken TV remote. The breakfast that is included is a joke! a singe type of bread roll you must ask if you want toast the rest is coffee OJ and tap water. If you want more you must pay. The best part is we booked a double and received 3 singles and when we explained that we booked a double they said sorry there is no more rooms left. There are room below the road but don't tell the management that they are in the basement because they aren't they are lower ground! But in the lift you must push the letter B (could that stand for basement? because if it doesn't shouldn't it read LG for lower ground!). Don't get fooled by the photos great Photoshop work. The best room in the hotel is the area just inside the front door but that only because you can turn around and leave. Thanks Flight Centre. Please do not stay here! London is beautiful don't have it upset by staying in a place like this. We did and we where popping sleeping tablets so we could sleep and go exploring around London the next day. This is not a fake review!,flipper34
UR19475538,2008-28-August,on arrival there was a large que to check in only one member off staff in attendance who was unhelpfull & fraught. Whilst waiting to check in my husband went to the bathroom and was horrified to see it in such a run down state  toilet seats broken badly stained grouting. I then went to the bathroom & the sink was cracked no soap or paper towels toilet seat broken & this was just the first impression. We were allocated a room on the 4th floor the door key was very difficult to manouver and it took several minutes to open the door as we entered we sunk into the floor as it was uneven the bathroom was dirty very dated looked like the taps plug hole had never been cleaned since installing. the floor tiles were grubby & the grouting was black with grime. bars on the windows which made the room even smaller than it was.The furnishings were very dated & broken nothing matched curtains were green bedding orange & red the throw smelt stale & the cost per night  100. We were given polestyrene cups & plastic spoons. to drink from. Continental breakfast was included in the price this consisted of bread roll with a choice of apricot or strawberry jam a tea-urn containing orange juice & choice of tea coffee or hot chocolate. We found alternative accommodation & checked out,ibbig
UR18268058,2008-26-July,Avoid this hotel at all costs. Having stayed in hotels from back-packers up to 7* all over the world this is the worst value hotel we have ever stayed in. Dirty stuffy rooms with poorly designed shower that wouldn't drain properly. Very noisy despite being in a relatively quiet area. Breakfast is virtually non-existent. Would recommend a back-packers over this place - less than half the price for the same quality. Other guests were making similar comments. How this place got a 3* even in London where the * rating system seems pretty random we'll never know.,AKiwiTraveller
UR20989817,2008-18-October,This past October 9-16 I travelled to London England with 25 other students from my High School and 3 womderful teachers. Our trip was organized through EF Tours an acredited and very pleasing touring company. This trip was honestly the best experience that I've ever had as a 16 year-old. England certainly is a beautiful country. Although there are always reminders that perfection cannot exist that's why swans have black spots under thier wings. For me the black spot was The Bayswater Inn. In order for my review to be understood one must believe that i hold no predujice and that my complaints are not results of high-matienence. If you are accustomed to blood on your sheets and tap fossets that do 360's then by all means enjoy your stay in the farthest thing form the lap of luxury. I'll start with the entry to the hotel where the elevator has it's own agenda and may make one wait up to 5 minutes for it to kick into gear. Some of the levels of this hotel had wood borded upon where glass should be in the elevator. Down to the basement i went with two other girls and others from my group were scattereed throughout all floors of the hotel depite a request to be together. The basement was a maze of pink and when i found our room i turned the key to find our humble home. Yes this time the key worked but other times the key wasn't even neccessary: jiggle the handle the right way and it was a waste to even need a key for room 24. The deadbolt was all that held my hope.The television did not work the radio did not work only 75% of the lights worked. And the ones that did took 3 minutes of flickering to settle into a constent glow. One of my teachers rooms had zero electricity apparently a fuse box had to be played with in order to gain light in her room. There was blood on our blanket. Blood. Is that really easy to be overlooked? I say no. And when we brought it to the reception they claimed it wasn't blood. But as a 16 year old female i'm well aware what blood on blankets looks like. Even if it wasn't blood why were we getting stained blankets? And why were we never brought a new blanket? After 3 phone calls and a visit to the front desk? One teacher had two beds in there room and gave us the blankets off of it. One was used to give padding between the springs protruding from the mattress. The next day: the bloody blanket was back. Although sheets were not changed and a stain of chocolate became our constent companion throughout the week. The most interesting affair seemed to be when a man watched a girl in another room change through the window until there was a man at our window. The window that didn't lock. At 3am our teachers were all up and showing teh receptionist how easy it was to get into our window from the outside. The receptionist gave my teacher a mop bucket full of rubber bands plaster and scotch tape with a few scattered screw drivers and screws in the mess. He told my teacher he could fix it if it really bothered him. And so he did. Our teachers weren't sure of what action should be taken should police be called? The receptionist thought not so they weren't. But when our tour guide who had a room at this lovely hotel but didn't saty there for obvious reasons became aware he called the police the morning after. The next day he requested mateniance to be done on all our rooms; checking the locks on windows and such. It wasn't done. But we did find that the maids had gone through our stuff and found some of the extra towles we had hid in our suitcases. They weren't the most amiable when being asked for towels. 1 towel per person but some of us girls liked one for our hair. Our teacher and a student stealthly borrowed some extras and the maid had found them when we had put them in our bags for the day. Our bathroom was the biggest of all the ones we saw there. European bathrooms are naturally small and i am aware of that. But the tap wasn't attachted to the sink: it did 360's the toilet was as stubborn as the lights and the bath tub had a draining issue. Light bulbs fell untouched from their sockets and water ran from the walls to add to the mold plastered along the floors. The lack of safety cleanliness and the rudeness exhibited by the staff of this establishment show the standard of this hotel. Many people said it was like "the shining." I'm not sure i would go this far but it certainly was the black spot in our swan of a vacation.,CanadianCherub
UR17952809,2008-16-July,We spent the last three days as a group of 50-odd school students and staff. The hotel overall treated us quite badly however we were quite lucky and got a nice triple single bed room on the third floor however other members of our party complained that they had been given horrific camp-beds and bunk beds. On the first night the water went off as of 11pm + and the TV reception was incredibly poor. The so called "Continental breakfast" which is supposedly included consisted of only a burger bap with a selection of jam and drinks to be honest you could get a better breakfast at McDonalds. One of the hotel's advantages is it's close proximity to the tube station and shops. Stairwells were very steep and lifts were slow and small. The basement is a maze and could easily be confusing to anyone. The hotel is in nice surroundings and first impressions of reception are great however the corridors and rooms are in dire need or refurbishment. The bathroom was very basic and had a very strange layout for example the toilet roll holder being at the opposite end of the room to the toilet itself. The shower was very dangerous as it was slippery when leaving the shower. The rooms seemed very claustraphobic and lighting was only at one end of the room. Also windows were very difficult to open and there were two large bulky iron radiators with sharp corners my friend managed to hit his leg on it while opening the window and was left cut and bruised. These could especially be dangerous for small childern. There was small warning sign however it was very difficult to read and was at ankle height. All in all this hotel is not worthy of its three star status as i have been in numerous three star hotels which have much better locations facilities and services (especially breakfast!) The experience was poor and i would definitely not return i was very glad i only had to endure this terrible ordeal for 2 nights.,redfox185
UR20098941,2008-15-September,My relatives from Norway are staying at this hotel. I came with them for check in and found the lady on reception to be abrupt and unhelpful. My Aunty is 76 and my cousin suffers from Asthma so we were alarmed to be shown to damp and smelly basement rooms. When we complained we were informed that these were the only rooms available. However after threatening to leave and requesting a refund we were shown to some semi- respectable rooms upstairs.,bluemic
UR14958302,2008-11-April,I regret staying at this hotel. I was staying in a hostel previously and it was so much better. My room here was so tiny the door would not open fully. If anyone who is clausterphobic were to stay here-they would go insane. My room was the size of a tuna can my private room in my hostel was bigger (the washroom too). The breakfest was awful just bread juice tea or coffee. I would not stay here again.,DreeDree
UR7779649,2007-5-June,Do you speak English is a commonly used phrase in this Hotel .The staff are mostly european and langauge was a real problem on our stay . having read previous reviews on this hotel we thought we would give it a go as the price and location seemed good  In future I will take more notice of trip reviews the hotel lived up to the worst of the reviews . We stayed in room 64  the mattress had collapsed there was no ventilation there was a constant smell of mould  the floor had sunk in ( causing problems during the night ) beds were poorly made up and food was left on the floor for up to 4 days . The public areas were old and and unclean as were the public toilets. Surprisingly the bread rolls tea and orange juice for breakfast were quite good as was the location .Next time in London I will stay at the sister hotel Faulty Towers .,AussieTourer54
UR8617710,2007-4-September,We stayed two nights at the Bayswater Inn last week booked through a small agent we found on a London website. The hotel has a lot of promise but our room was so pokey that the double (well a single and-a-bit) bed was up against a wall so one of us had to crawl down the bed in the night to get to the loo avoiding banging our head on the wall-mounted TV as we went. The room smelt strongly of smoke the loo was so close to the radiator in the bathroom that you had to sit sideways (too much info I'm sure) and there were really thick prison-esque bars at the windows. The continental breakfast consisted of three types of bread roll with little portions of jam and some coffee that made my teeth squeek. I'm used to that type of breakfast offering pastries and often meat and cheese too. At leats there's a Tesco Express opposite Bayswater tube station. On the plus side drinks in the bar were quite reasonably priced. We booked on a tight budge due to impending parenthood but I would recommend spending a little more and picking somewhere different if possible it certainly isn't the three star we were told it was.,mjkyorkshire
UR6553369,2007-4-January,Sorry this review is far from complete. This "hotel" is simply not worth a review but a severe warning. "All the extras you would expect in a London 3 star standard hotel"? My room was a rat hole in the cellar smaller than a prison cell next to a noisy lift motor almost no natural light; with a door where light shines though all night; stinky and rotten. What a shameless rip-off.,daniel.hopp
UR8247729,2007-28-July,My husband and I took our teenagers to London for our big vacation. Bayswater hotel (3stars) was listed in our package via our travel agent. We read the bad reviews but we booked 2 rooms hoping for the best. When we arrived I was horrified to see black mold in the shower the bed unevenly sloped against the wall mold on the linens...an odor of sour mildew was present in each room...no soaps/shampoos and the bath mat was made of paper. The carpet and walls had stains on them. I wouldnt let my kids touch the comforter or floor barefoot. All afternoon I made calls to the U.S. hunting for a better hotel via our travel co whom didn't help us at all. At our own expense we changed hotels the next morningI Since our breakfast was included we drank the coffee and sour juice but wouldn't touch anything else. There were no smiles from the waitstaff. Who can blame them? We took photos to make our case with our travel co. Our memory of London will begin with a entire wasted day searching for a clean place to stay. There is one positive. The staff were helpful kind and understood our plight.,travelfam005
UR11020808,2007-24-November,Oh dear! I work in hotels and fully understand that you get what you pay for so when a hotel says 'Double bed and continental breakfast' thats what I expect! The problems started the minute we arrived the receptionist (v nice girl) checked us in we got to the room and it stank of smoke-this is suppose to be a non smoking hotel!(some people have no consideration) we requested to move rooms even thought they were fully booked we were allocated to a second roomgreat I thought until we found out it was a triple room so we requested a different room. The duty manager (v unhelpful unfriendly woman) told us they were full and would 'sort it tomorrow'. By now Im in the bar leaving my partner to get us a suitable room. Eventually we get a room and while it was generally clean the bed was rather small (think 3/4 bed) and there was dust all over the mirror frames the lampshades etc great for allergies . Neither night did I manage more than 4 hours sleep (total not continuous). The shower in the morning was great until I saw the size of the towel that was suppose to dry me! (hand towel springs to mind-spare a thought for my rugby player built South African boyfriend) On our second morning we did venture down for breakfast I have experienced better in a 20 a night scummy hotel by a train station! Continental breakfast-look it up! Traditionally consists of bread pastries (croissants and danish) coffee milk and juice. Hard bread rolls and white toast (no choice) didn't quite live up to it. Service was also appalling-not one member of staff smiled or said good morning despite the fact we did both. A SMILE COST NOTHING! Anyway to sum up this rant up the hotel will be getting a complaint letter as will the site we booked it through. Don't be fooled by the good location and prices-book a Travel Lodge or a hostel-you will definately have a better experience!,Wonderbra_Star
UR6641617,2007-22-January,Hi Everyone We stayed at this hotel as part of our vacation package booked by Gate 1 Travel. We were there for 4 nights & just got back. I am the type of traveler who has no problem staying in a 1 or 2 star hotel or even a hostel when I vacation in Europe. All I need is a safe neighborhood a clean bed & I'm happy. This hotel was in a safe neighborhood that offered plenty of food choices & was close to public transportation. However the negatives for the hotel outweighed the positives. Our initial response to the room was "OK" but upon closer observation we found multiple things that needed repair or cleaning. This hotel could be a nice place to stay if the owners put out the money to update the facilities  we decided its just cheaper to pack the tourist in every few days since a remodel or update would cut into profits. Positives - The reception staff were pleasant to deal with. The room had the basic necessaries - heat hot water in the shower hair dryer hot water maker for soup & tea & a TV for those who need that item. They did offer a free breakfast but choices were very limited (3 types of rolls butter & jam coffee tea hot chocolate & watered down orange juice/drink). Negatives - This establishment is old & in need of some basic TLC. It has definitely seen better days - The halls & rooms had an odor. Our beds were extremely uncomfortable - we could feel the individual springs poking through. The bathroom was very small - that was OK but I would like to have had a toilet that actually worked. It wouldn't flush unless you took the top off the tank and manually held down the bulb while flushing. I told the front desk but they never responded to my request to have it fixed. (I guess it's just easier & cheaper to pretend you will have a repairman fix it but then not follow through.) The shower stall was so small that when you went to turn around to rinse off your back you couldn't do so without bumping the on-off handle & turning off the water (we're not large people either). There was mold in the shower stall. I couldn't tell if the towels laid out for our last day were stained or possibly dirty. They needed to be replaced. The soap left out for our use had been unwrapped & I couldn't tell if it had been used or not - luckily we had brought our own to use. No shampoo was available  luckily we had brought that too. Bath mat was a piece of paper. No hand towels just one big bath towel for each adult in the room. Only natural light was a window that looked onto a brick wall several feet away. The luggage room was like others on the site have described it - locked in a room with buzzer access - gave the appearance of security without really being secure - anyone could gain access by simply pressing the buzzer - didn't have to show anything that proved you were guests of the hotel to gain access. The rating above woud really fall between the 1-2 dots. Not terrible - but not OK. Would I stay there again  No Way - To many negatives!,Travel-gal/8323
UR8737772,2007-17-September,This hotel was absolutely disgusting. Unfortunately the bad reviews are all correct so advice to anyone considering staying at this hotel: the reviews are true and take them seriously. I had to see it to believe it. First of all the whole hotel gives you a feeling of uncleanliness and filth. The staff barely speaks English and no one is willing to answer your questions and if we asked for something we would get a look and an attitude that we were needlessly occupying their time. The staff in the breakfast room was especially rude. The cleaning ladies WALKED INTO our room without knocking first while we were still in there changing/showering/getting ready and one day we were still asleep and had to wake up to find strangers IN THE ROOM. This happened 2 of the 3 days we were there and it also happened to our friends staying there. All the furniture is badly outdated in horrid conditions (especially the mattresses) and I felt I had to sterilize my hands every time I touched something. We were awakened at 3 a.m. one day by reception because they wanted to know if our bathroom had flooded! I asked for an extra towel got it yet the next day it was removed promptly by the cleaning staff. My experience with this hotel was horrible and I strongly advise anyone against staying there. The only positive for this hotel is its location but there are tons of other nicer cleaner hotels for the same or less price in the area.,FlopsyAthens_Greece
UR11632023,2007-17-December,Booked this hotel through Late Rooms. I selected this hotel because of its reasonable price and location as it was within 10 minutes walk from a ridiculously expensive hotel where I was attending an industry dinner. On arrival they claimed that they had a computer problem and did not have a room for me. Consequently they shunted me off to Earls Court to a hotel that was nearly 20 cheaper and ended up in having taxi rides (which the hotel paid for). I had to wiat 40 minutes for my taxi back after the dinner. Absolute mess of my evening. I have made a formal compliant but have had no response after 10 days.,Eagles50
UR7617127,2007-15-May,But I wouldn't know. They put me in a cell in the basement. And I kid you not - the room was smaller than a police holding cell. I took the elevator down wandered through the maze of corridors to my room inserted the key and...walked straight into the nightstand. In order to pull my suitcase into the room I needed to first open the closet door directly opposite the room door then step into the closet open the room door all the way and grab my suitcase before it wandered off. The window lock appeared to be broken but that apparently didn't matter much since I had a grand view of...a window well. The bathroom while it had a nifty heated towel rack was a tad too narrow for someone larger than a house cat. I'm quite small yet even I discovered one morning that it was possible to simultaneously burn my back on the towel rack and bash my forehead in on the faux marble ledge over the sink as I leaned over to wash my face. The walls appeared to have been made of rice paper because I could hear every single movement in every room down in the basement. And judging by the number of families I heard I was only mildly reassured that they didn't just put the solo travellers in the dungeon. I'm a very low-maintenance traveller. I can deal with just about anything as long as I'm not rooming with rats or roaches. This was the only time I thought seriously about asking for another room. But since the room actually was quite clean and I was only there for a short time I decided to suck it up and deal. It's definitely a hotel for the budget traveller.,xenophilic
UR6786640,2007-13-February,I took 18 of my students (aged 18 to 20) to the hotel in February. I had stayed in the area - though not at this hotel - before and can only recommend it (the area that is). Pubs restaurants supermarkets a shopping centre cinemas the park and two underground stations are all within walking distance. You can also stroll through the park to the museums (Victoria & Albert Science etc.) and end up within walking distance of Harrods. If you are into walking you could even walk through the park to Oxford Street. The Bayswater Inn was my third choice a hotel I had stayed at before was being renovated another didn`t take groups. After reading some of the rewievs I was a bit apprehensive but the only really negative experience we had was with the front desk. A woman who called herself the supervisor was extremely rude and unhelpful when two of my students asked to change their room because they had not been able to sleep all night because of a group of Spanish teenagers partying next door. Other members of staff were friendly but seemed disorganised e. g. they couldn`t find our reservations even though we had already filled in all the forms in the morning. As other reviewers have pointed out you have to leave your luggage in the luggage room which can be accessed by anyone. On arrival the "friendly supervisor" even suggested leaving it in the hotel lobby! My room was a single on the first floor which had the size of a shoe box and faced a brick wall. Even though it was right next to the elevator it was quiet - the bed was a nightmare though. If I went to the hotel again I would book myself a twin at the same price as the single. None of us stayed in the basement but I had the chance to look at one of the rooms and can only underline what previous reviewers have said it is like living in a hole. Breakfast was rolls and jam which was basically what I had expected - it is London after all. At least it was buffet style. I had stayed at a London hotel before where you got two pieces of toast and that was it. If you have not been to London before as a rule you get much less than you pay for. Rooms are tiny. So if you are talking value for money (London style) I would say the hotel is ok. It is a sightseeing trip after all and the time you spend at the hotel is extremely limited. Still I would not recommend the hotel to individual travellers. There were three international groups there during our stay. A choir from Norway a group a Spanish teenagers and us. Surprisingly they did not put me on the same floor as my students which I suppose also happened with the Spanish group thus the excessive noise at night (see above). The hotel offers a bar that is reasonably priced service was good. In a putshell yes I would probably take a group there again no I would never choose this hotel for a private trip.,sd604
UR8395143,2007-11-August,We stayed here from June 4-11 2007. The pictures look great but prove that pictures can be deceiving. The double room made a Motel Six look like the Ritz-Carlton. The beds looked like they had been used army surplus from WWII. With the exception of the night clerk David (who was a joy to deal with and quite ebullient) the staff was rather unhelpful and quite dour in their demeanor. "Amenities" were a joke. Can you believe a disposable paper bath mat (good for only one shower so if more than one is staying here you'll have problems)? One towel no face cloths no washcloths per person. Beds were "made" but sheets were not replaced and when they were the sheets clearly had large stains on them which looked liked dryed but washed blood. Further if you must stay here I would like to point out that this hotel is VERY heterosexual and if you are not you will feel quite uncomfortable and unwelcome. Don't do this to yourself. From my observations while there and since there are better hotels at more reasonable prices in the area. The area is a good one close to the Bayswater and Queensway tubes with major bus routes on Bayswater Road.,radboy
UR5314409,2006-6-June,Be prepared to have an 'extensive' choice of brown or white mouldy rolls for breakfast and a very lumpy bed with rock hard pillows. The location was good though.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR4394964,2006-29-January,This hotel was represented by the agency "Gate1 Travel" as being a three star. It is located in a decent ethnic neighborhood (Greek & Algerian?) about 5-7 minutes walking time from Bayswater tube station. The location is also convenient to Paddington Station (about 15-20 minutes walk) and Hyde Park / Kensington Gardens (5-10 minutes walk) When we arrived in the morning we found the lobby and staff to be pleasant enough with good security but beyond that is where the trouble starts. For starters the luggage room was filthy Wood chips all over the floor from the cracked and broken racks. It was obvious that it has not been cleaned in a very long time if ever. After a day on the town we returned and were given two rooms in the basement. The first was a small single. The entire room was about six feet wide by ten feet long and the temperature was about 90 degrees F. The knob on the radiator was broken so it could not be adjusted. The other room was supposed to be a double and it was fairly large with two single beds and a double bed however the condition of the room was atrocious. The stench of old smoke permeated the room and there was graffiti on some of the walls. The double bed was pushed up against one wall that was covered with scuffs and dirt as if someone had walked on it. The carpet had numerous stains on it and appeared heavily worn. The bed linens were old and worn looking with holes in the bedspreads and there was some kind of stain on one of the sheets that appeared to have chunks of something stuck to it. The bath had cracked and broken tiles on the floor. We returned immediately to the front desk and after considerable debate with the night manager I escorted her to the rooms and pointed out all of the aforementioned flaws. It was only after this and more persistent badgering that she finally agreed to move us. The other rooms were better but not much. They gave us a double on the second floor and another different single in the basement. The single was no bigger than the first one but had a much better temperature. The only real flaw here other than the size was that the shower head could not be adjusted and in order to get wet one had to get very close to the shower controls which were positioned such that a slight bump would send the water temperature plummeting or soaring to the point of scalding. There were also guests in the next room who were drunk and very loud when they came in at 4:30AM. The noise continued until 7 AM when I left the room for the day. I advised the desk clerk who seemed indifferent to the problem. The double room on the second floor was much better if smaller than the one in the basement and other than the fact that everything looked old and worn there were no problems. There are two elevators in the building but one of them was broken for most of our three night stay making the walk to our rooms twice as far a it needed to be. As for the continental breakfast here is the exact menu: Wheat Roll White Roll Poppy Seed Roll Butter Apricot preserve Strawberry Preserve Coffee and Orange Juice (From a can). If you want anything else it's extra. I have described this hotel as well as I can. If you are told that this hotel is anything more than a good one star or a poor two star you are being lied to.,pigbro
UR6180882,2006-27-November,We arrived in the morning and left our cases in the luggage room which was not at all secure. Entrance is gained by pressing a buzzer - you do not need to show a ticket or press a code. Anybody could gain entrance and walk out with your suitcase. If you are travelling by train then use the lockers at Paddington Station instead. There were always long queues at the reception and the staff were very abrupt. We booked a double room but was given a twin room. Staff not sympathetic/helpful at all about this - we were told they would do nothing. We were extremely dismayed by the size of the room - at most there was only 2 foot of space between the beds or the wall/wardrobe. The wallpaper was peeling in places the ceiling sagged down and there were metal bars over the window. The beds were camp beds; the mattresses were extremely uncomfortable - we both felt bruised by the broken springs. Tiny bathroom. The bath mat was a piece of paper. Decorated with blotchy green/white/brown tiles. The walls were very thin - the noise came straight through from the corridor. Every time someone opened their door we thought someone was going to walk into our room. The lift was very slow and make loud groaning noises/shuddered.,MacJady
UR5014957,2006-27-April,Let's start on a positive note - It was not so difficult to get to. It is only a short distance to the Bayswater underground station. It is located in a neighborhood that is very ethnically diverse and has restaurants from every nationality to match. WARNING: Beds in this hotel are not beds by any reasonable standard. One earlier reviewer called them cots which is actually the truth. They are flimsy dirty lumpy torn "mattresses" on a wire frame. It is just not fit to sleep on. We were travelling with a party of four other persons and all of the beds were the same regardless of room location. We had each prepaid $900 U.S.for 3 nights and were stuck. The included "breakfast" consisted of a stale roll with terrible coffee and worse "orange juice." And the staff providing this fare did so with a level of service that would have gotten them fired from a job in a prison inmate cafeteria. The bathrooms are so small that it is difficult for an average person to sit on the toilet. Beware of basement rooms. Yes they have basement rooms - and they don't really disclose that you are getting a beasement room. Its like a surprise. The dungeon in the Tower of London must be better. That the rooms are small I can overlook because that is the standard in Europe. But these rooms are dirty. In fact everything in the place is dingy. It is a horrible place to stay in a city as classy as London and can really put you in a negative mood during your stay.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR6014180,2006-26-October,This place was terrible. The beds were awful (the springs would dig into me and wake me up all night). The staff were unfriendly. There was no handtowel and the bathmat was a piece of paper. The rooms were dirty. The breakfast was much worse than a hostel I stayed at for half the price. Do I need to say anymore? For the price I thought this was a terrible place to stay!,NZtraveller2
UR5292090,2006-2-June,We arrived with a school party of 60 and the room was an average size The huge problem is nobody is fluent in english so this makes things extremely difficult also staff are rude and incompetent. Breakfast is a joke we didnt bother the second morning we can eat bread and jam at home. I am sure prison breakfast is of a higher calibre. The beds are so uncomfortable we didnt sleep you can feel every spring in your back and on night number one we wanted to leave. Night number two there was a pool of vomit by the lift and this stank the floor out! never again would we return it isnt suitable for a school party as in no way can corridors be policed with the amount of fire doors and lifts and stairs! It was horrid! i am sure for the same price higher notch accomodation can be found,A TripAdvisor Member
UR5360203,2006-19-June,I was very unhappy with this hotel and so was Kel. HoweverIgor the fictitious man who lives in room 101 provided much entertainment for Robbie K. The hotel staff did not care that a 15 year old male ran around the corridors for over an hour displaying his arm pit hair and wearing nothing but boxers. Cripes! A pool of vomit was left undisturbed outside of the lift and 2 members of the trip organisation staff were verbally abused by a Russian lady built like a tank. The language skills of the staff were to be commended (it was such a shame that English was not spoken). One night I approached the desk with my card for room 118 to get my key. I put it upside down on the desk only to be told by one of the Scandinavian staff that "there was no room 811." However if you go and stay here you can look forward to the luxurious breakfasts of bread rolls. Oh and don't bring your children as the staff are possibly the most anti-social people I have ever met.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR5806390,2006-16-September,tiny rooms. mouldy bathrooms. very uncomfortable camp beds. smells terrible. basement rooms mean you can't leave a window open for fresh air incase someone comes in. unfriendly staff. terrible breakfast -bread rolls cheap orange juice and a mild excuse for coffee. Need i say more? Spend a few more pounds and have a much better experience. Well avoided.,robEK2
UR5339058,2006-13-June,This hotel was just pathetic! You just had to laugh!! First of all the rooms were tiny and were originally made for 3 people but they had placed a camp bed in to fit more people in! It was just ridiculous. The T.V didn't work the kettle took ages to boil the hairdryer nearly blew up and the 'tea making facilities' were something to laugh about! The beds were extremely uncomfortable and people resulted in sleeping on the floor as this was cleaner and more comfy. The shower and toilet did not work which is very unhygienic! The staff were out of order. On the first night they would not give us our keys as we were told that the key cards were for breakfast only. This meant a group of 60 school children at 11:30 at night were sat waiting to go to bed. When trying to explain to the staff that they had made a mistake in broken English they firstly shouted at me then one of our teachers then another pupil and finally me again! The staff were extremely rude and should be sacked. On the second night at about 12:30 there were 2 drunken men shouting and vomiting everywhere which was not dealt with. One of our group needed a camp bed and so we went down to reception and explained the situation and asked for help. This resulted in once again being shouted at and told that we could have no bed pillows or quilt! 'Breakfast' was a joke! You did have a large choice between brown mouldy rolls or white mouldy rolls! On the second day we had no breakfast due to the poor quality. The hotel was disastrous and practically ruined our holiday. So thank you very much to all the staff that went on the trip from Bury Church High School without you the trip would have gone downhill from start to finish! xx,A TripAdvisor Member
UR5605296,2006-13-August,Do yourself a favor and do not stay at the Bayswater Inn! I was a guest there for seven nights for Christmas 2005. Moldy bathroom staff very unhelpful and the heater was broken in my room but they would not fix it citing "no one is around during the holidays". I caught a bad cold due to freezing in my room.....they would not move me to another room. But the prize complaint is that the front desk staff messed up my reservation and while I was out enjoying London they went into my room and packed everything up and gave my room to another person even though I paid in advance and had a confirmation for the entire week! No apologies and I had to fight with the manager to get a refund. Horrible horrible horrible hotel! So if you enjoy mold broken heaters and people going through your stuff this is the place for you!,Martin71
UR4311877,2005-30-December,What a joke!!!! I will never stay there again....I could hardly even get through the door. I use a wheelchair and before I scheduled my trip I called and spoke with the hotel staff who assured me that there were no stairs and the elevator doors were large enough for a wheelchair. Obviously they were wrong and extremely rude when I talked to them about the problem!!!!!!!!!!,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3589625,2005-21-June,I stayed at the Bayswater Inn as a single guest on May 29-30 2005 and will definitely not ever return. I was booked into a single room in which I could barely turn around. There was not even enough space to lay my suitecase out - I had to close my suitecase in order to get to the bed. The worse part however was the noise. My room was in the basement and located next to the housekeeping closet. At 06:30 AM I was awakened by bags of bed linens being thrown against my window which just happend to be next to the door which supplied the housekeeping closet. I reported this to the front desk asked for another room and was refused. Not even a courteous apology or explanation was provided. I also had the honor of listening to the activities of the couple next door well into the night. The walls are very thin. Breakfast was strictly bread and coffee. If you want eggs you will pay 7.00 (almost $14.00 US). My advise is that if you book on-line verify the location of your room within the hotel. More times than not if you get a good deal on line you will not get a good room unless you ask otherwise you will end up in the basement. I am an American who lives in the UK and have grown accustomed to the smaller spaces of the European lifestyle however this hotel took the lack of space excessive noise and customer service levels to a new low. There are better hotels on the same street which are much better and around the same price!,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3690109,2005-21-July,The managers of this hotel should be ashamed ! You call this a 3 star hotel ??? Let me laugh !!! Never saw a sad hotel like that in my whole life. You people are just parasites ! And more customers we spoke had the same reactions. Very unsympathetic reception by a Pakistan guy. We slept in an old room in the basement. Plenty things broken old paint holes everywhere no outside view from the window. Continental breakfast ??? Never saw that in my whole life: Just a few sandwiches with butter and marmalade and that's it ! Nothing salty no cheese no bacon no cereals nothing !!! Never no more ! This is what people call a one-time-shot hotel. You go ones and never no more ! Just take a look at some pictures you'll know what I mean ! Jean-Marc Van Ravels Antwerp Belgium,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3112710,2005-2-February,We stayed at the Bayswater Inn for 6 nights and read the reviews after having booked the room. So arriving at the hotel we were wondering:"Would it be true everything told in those reviews?" And the answer is unfortunately "Yes!". The arrival at the hotel was ok and the lady at the reception was kind and..english. The room was small but on the 4th Floor so far from the street noise and ....close to the noise of the elevator. We could also follow all conversations of the people in the room next to us. But hey the color TV worked well and with the BBC or ITV (that's it) it was not to difficult to concentrate on something else. The first morning we wanted to have a shower... Surprise: there was no hot water. At the reception they explained us that there was a problem with the boilers and that 50% of the hotel was without hot water. Ok can happen. But on the second morning: no hot water. And so on... Until the last morning. Luckily some afternoons there'd been warm water. However we filled out a complaint on a blank invoice given by a rude lady claiming she was "the Manager today". Last but not least on the 5th day we discovered that our towels were never changed... and we had to go to reception to get a pair of fresh ones. Conclusion: believe most of the reviews on this hotel ready to become Fawlty Towers n 2 !!,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3478468,2005-17-May,This was probably the worst hotel I have ever stayed at. The room was tiny dirty in the basement with one window onto an airshaft. The beds were what we describe in the US as cots and the mattresses were lumpy. The carpet was stained the curtains dirty. The breakfast was rolls and instant coffee with watered orange juice. We only ate there once. On the plus side the desk staff was friendly and helpful and the location was good. The room was not noisy but I think we may have been the only guests in that dank basement. Next time I would definitely spring for the extra money for a decent room.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3571369,2005-17-June,The hotel location is bad  it is difficult to find if you haven't print out the map in the internet. I go to there early so i cannot check in immediately. So that i store my luggage in the room .The room have lock but everybody can also enter to that room to get back the luggage . But there is a risk to lost your luuage as everyone also can go to that room to get the luggage (EVEN you can get the other person 's luggage ) It is so Horrabile. I stay in second floor so i think it is better than stay in basement . The room is not bad . But the room service will not change the towel in the toilet even I stay there for 4 night ( HORRIBLE ). I also find they also will not change the bed sheet also. At night  it is easy the hear the sound near your room . I heard the childen opposite my room run and run and they run to the room at about 6am. Luckily i still can sleep . Hope you will luckily not stay in basement . I you will not stay in that terrible hotel again.,koalaip
UR3908909,2005-16-September,I stayed at the Bayswater Inn with my wife and will not return. The room was too small. however our room was in a quiet area and the location of the hotel is quite good. Don't expect a courteous frontdesk. Quiet neighbourhood close to Bayswater tube station. nearby at Hereford we found Restaurant Veronica's it's very good nice and friendly.,Cres
UR3365899,2005-15-April,I booked a single and a twin room under the condition not to have a room in the basement. Otherwise there would not be a booking. When we arrived we learned that for one night the single room was in the basement (near the elevator!) and that we would have a double room although I had sent an extra e-mail before to ask for a twin room. My son and I do not prefer a double bed. Although the female administrator was unlikable in handling this case we got a triple room. On the other hand the receptionist was very polite and kind. Some beds need new mattresses. Breakfast is sufficient but not of a good quality. The distance to London-city is a 15 min. walk or you can take the underground (about 600 m.). The price/quality ratio is insufficient.,jwmpet
UR3550181,2005-14-June,Staying here was horrible and I've stayed in so called "bad" places before. I have to agree with most of the comments from the last poster. I was booked for 4 or 5 nights and they tried to put me in the basement near the elevator and I slept one night there it was the size of the closet and no place to put my suitecase not enough floor space to even put it on the floor! I felt so tucked it was a little worrisome... I didn't expect much for the breakfast buns and coffee but I'm not a morning person so I left to go get a real coffee anyway. When they changed my rooms it wasn't any better but it was on the ground floor and SOO cold in the room there was no door on the bathroom either probably because it wasn't big enough. I finally apologized for my nuisance and offered to pay for a larger room that I just could not do one more night without sleep. So they then put me on the 3rd floor in a double room facing the front which was much more comfortable I've learned my lesson!!,lynzee
UR2171380,2004-8-June,Stayed in London for 5 nights Our room was clean. we were on the 4th floor.It was a average size. One thing is the beds are hardfeels like your sleeping a park bench. It was just average Loved London!!!!!!!,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2805274,2004-4-November,It has to be the worst hotel ive ever been to we didnt even stay 1 night we checked out as soon as seen the rooms. They were musty smelled of B.O and very dark and depressing. We litrally ran out of the hotel i cant think of anything nice to say about the hotel it was just a nightmare. You Have Been Warned.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2149503,2004-3-June,Please do yourself a favor and pay the extra money (as I will next time) and stay somewhere else. The rooms are run down our sink was full of some sort of caulking material to plug a leak. When walking back to the hotel we were nearly injured when pieces of the building's fascade came crashing on the sidewalk below. Worse then than the noise that came from the other rooms was the COCKROACHES that were found daily and this was in February! NO THANKYOU!,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2605322,2004-28-September,it was one of the worst hotels I ve ever been to. The worst thing is that you have to wait for your neighbours going asleep...you you cannot sleep because of noisenoisenoise!!!get yourself another hotel. if you already booked the hotel you should definately cancel it. or get the newest earplugs!!!!,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2226693,2004-28-June,Start to finish it was horrendous. Rude staff poor quality food extra cramped room with no towels and leaking toilet. Management were extremely difficult. Never would I ever recommend this place to my worst enemy. Not to mention overpriced. Awful ruined my trip to London.,CanadianCatWoman
UR2508526,2004-2-September,I don't think I have ever had such an unhappy stay in a hotel. The moment I walked into the Bayswater Inn I wanted to walk out. I was staying in London for 3 nights while working and I should have just bought a sleeping bag and slept under my office desk! I thought people in who worked in hospitality were meant to be hospitable. Check in was a nightmare the 'reception manager' was having an argument with a potential guest and didnt even acknowledge that I was there and the person who did check me in was extremely rude and was unhelpful when I had questions. I walked into my bedroom and could have cried what a waste of money. The carpet was dirty the room was dingy and cramped the bathroom was a glorified cupboard and the window was non-existant! My three nights sleep would have been more beneficial if I stayed awake. The room was not sound proof and the constant banging of the front door and other guest noises kept me awake. The bed was hard and uncomfortable - it was like sleeping on gravel. I did not venture into the dining room after seeing the state of my bedroom - the kitchen cant be all that much better! The only good thing about my stay was walking out the front door for the last time. I will never walk back in there again - even if you paid me! Being British I feel ashamed that tourists come to visit London and have their stay ruined by staying here. What kind of a friendly hygienic lovable image are we portraying to our foreign counterparts with a place like this? Ive lived in London while at university and now work in the city. I love the city and wish that others can feel the same way. How can they if they visit this so-called hotel outfit? I am so sorry to visitors to London who had to stay here and I would not recommend this for anyone to stay - not even dogs!,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2818977,2004-11-November,After having already booked this hotel (for late May) and then reading the reviews I must say that I was very worried! My family (mom aunt and cousins we were a group of 5 women) and I arrived after a very long overnight flight from the US at 6:30 am. We were told that our rooms (they don't have rooms to accomodate 5 people so we had two rooms) would not be ready until 3pm my mom complained and then they said maybe by 1pm. So we were left to wander the streets of London having had no sleep. We were told to leave our luggage in a room that resembled a chicken coop this was a room that all of the guests had access to and therefore did not seem like a very safe place to leave any thing of value. We put our bags towards the back because it was relatively empty but by the time we got back the room was so full that we had to pull out a lot of other luggage just to get to our own! We got in our room at 1:30 the rest of the family did not get in until later. We were surprised by a number of things in the room... the bad: very very small (granted being from the US I am used to very spacious accomodations) very hot and stuffy (no ac) very hard bed no washcloths (we had to buy our own); the good: extremely clean room and bathroom (with a clean tub) no bad smell no bugs (even with the window open all of thge time) working window nice size closet not noisy and an alarm clock. I was very relieved at how clean it was after having read the reviews. The staff in the hotel were all from non-english speaking countries and were very hard to understand we often just got blank stares when we asked things such as "what time does the tube start running?" The main concierge (the manager maybe) was extremely flirtatious much to our aggravation. But he did confirm all of our tours for us and made one mistake. You have turn in your key everytime you leave maybe that is standard? I want comment on the breakfast as it is thoroughly covered here. This hotel had a wonderful location as it was just a short walk to the nearest underground (Bayswater Station). Others have said that it is in a bad neighborhood but we did not have any probelms even when we were returning late at night. Someone on the street even volunteered to take a picture of the whole group so that I could get in the picture and didn't run off with my camera! All in all my stay in London was the best experience of my life and I can not wait to go back! Do not be afraid to ask people on the streets or in shops for directions everyone is very accomodating! I would probably stay at Bayswater Inn again because it is inexpensive. However if I had more money I would probably stay somewhere else. Afterall you probably won't spend much time in your hotel!,A TripAdvisor Member
