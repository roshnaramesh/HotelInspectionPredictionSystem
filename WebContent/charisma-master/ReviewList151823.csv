UR122828885,2012-9-January,My wife and I go to Puerto Rico every year. For 2011/2012 Christmas & New Years holiday we decided to make it special. We wanted to spend it on the island. We had stayed at the San Juan Beach several years ago when they were under renovations. We took that into consideration and put up with the inconveniences it was a good stay. So we looked at the web site for 2011 and saw what appeared to be new pictures of completed renovations and booked a 10 day stay. WOW!! What a shock we got when we arrive to find that the owner(s) shifted the emphasis from customer service to greed. The lobby was beautifully redone although simple. A restaurant El Perurrican) had been added but you must be into strictly seafood (Not much diversity). The free breakfast that was served during our last stay was done away with. We assumed too make way for much better accommodations. WRONG! When we entered the room what a shock we got to find that it smelled musty was very dirty and with stained carpets. The bathroom was full of mold mildew and rust. All the bathroom fixtures had mold mildew and rust. The window shades were broken so you had to take them down and roll them by hand. The air conditioner (although it worked) sounded like a freight train all night so we convinced ourselves that it was the sound of the ocean in our room so that we could sleep. We did have an ocean view room (which we payed extra for) We could not get room service to leave us clean towels and the sheets were not changed. Only the bed was remade again and again for 10 days with the same sheets. I believe we had bedbugs because we were itching all night an in the morning we both had bites all over our bodies. (we marked the sheets to make sure). No coffee machine NO blow dryer although the blow dryer plate was attached to the wall. On the third day we took a ride on the elevator and were joined by 4 housekeepers. I am Puerto Rican and speak the language my wife is Irish/Italian and only understands it a little bit. Well these 4 housekeepers were discussing in Spanish how pissed (Encojona) they were that tourist would not leave the hotel until noon or after thus causing them to be delayed in their duties. And that they could not find a room on a higher floor where they could watch TV and rest. At check out they attempted to charge us for 10 days of valet parking at $18 a day knowing full well that we only used the valet parking for 7 days the valets were very good and pleasant . When we did try to launch a complaint the only person we could find did not appear to care about our problems. One employ did tell us that the new management did not appear interested in pleasing the customers only profit. NEVER AGAIN!! Beautiful Condado area but book at your own risk.,Richard M
UR122765308,2012-8-January,The lobby and restaurant are beautiful! The front desk personnel were very nice! Then we got out of the elevator and the nice ends! The halls are dirty and smell but not near as bad as our room! It was dirty wet and humid and there was mold everywhere! They just painted over it. The bathroom was gross! There was no fridge and it smelled bad!! Also there is no swimming allowed on the beach! You have to walk down to the public beach a few blocks away to swim! Also if you go to Puerto Rico figure out the busses- get a route list because the cabs are crazy expensive!! The bus cost $0.75 they are air conditioned and relatively clean! I definitely reccommend the restaurant! The food is great the service was very nice and the view of the ocean is amazing! It is rather pricey but the food all over San Juan was pricey so if you are going to spend the money anyway you might as well really enjoy the food!!,Kelly D
UR122677314,2012-6-January,We have visited Puerto Rico for the past 11 years. The past year we decided to stay elsewhere due to the lobby of the San Juan Beach Hotel being remodeled. We figured that since the lobby was redone the rooms would have been updated also. Not so. When we arrived at our beach front hotel room we were very disappointed to find that the rooms did not even compare to a 1 - 2 star hotel room. The lobby was redone to lure in the unsuspected tourists into thinking that the rest of the hotel would be as elegant. The room had furniture from about 15 years ago the sheets on the bed were not changed until we called to request them after 4 days. We placed a mark on the sheets to see how long it would take them to change the linens. We started itching after the first night only to find that there were bed bugs. The bathroom was disgusting tub stained towels not picked up unless we requested clean ones to be delivered. The air conditioner kept us up all night for the 10 nights that we were there. We complained about the noise it was making and were told that all the units were the same. Unbelievable. When going out for the day we also placed our bags in a certain position where as if they were moved or tampered with we would know. Yes they were gone through. Needless to say we were so frustrated that we decided to stay with family for most of our visit. The beach was not a beach at all. Walk down to what they call a beach and you will find nothing but rocks everywhere. Not a space big enough to place a chair or towel. You are not allowed to lay on their beach. Disaster area. Wasting money on this horrible hotel. Please if you are looking for an economical hotel do not pick this one. You will not only be disappointed but shafted out of your hard earned money We took plenty of pictures of the room in case we are not believed.,ppyacheer
UR122628415,2012-5-January,This hotel looked really nice on the website and the lobby was really pretty. The room was horrible! The ceiling was rotting by the window there were bugs in the bathroom the beds were disgusting! I slept on top of the comforter... I would not advise this hote unless your totally desperate. For $130 you can do better!,Jessie R
UR127257989,2012-4-April,I didn't want to take off my shoes the carpet was so dirty. This place is just very very rundown and needs major work.,jessr1010
UR123889793,2012-30-January,from jan 24 to 26 2012...the staff super friendly the lobby 4 stars the restaurant 4 stars but the rooms? 1st room; mold smell roaches no a/c no hot water.. 2nd room; roaches (woke up with a roach on myt neck) a/c good no hot water... 3rd room a/c no bad wet carpet humid roaches no hot water..they offer a 4th room; remodel but dirty like they just finish the remodeling no hot water and roaches. they gave me all the money back including the valet parking ($20 a day) and the $50 security deposit. my 10 years anniversary the first time my mother in law in Puerto Rico. 3 days with asthma because the mold smell.if they fix the rooms is going to be a 4 stars hotel. now is just a 1 star hotel. check your room before pay and dont do the internet pre-pay.if you dare to stay here after this review you have to be crazy. read the other reviews. i am not the only one,machy4973
UR126782410,2012-27-March,I hate writing a review like this but our 1 night stay was AWFUL! When we entered our room it smelled like mildew but we thought just 2 nights and it is late. We asked for washcloths and were told :They didn't wash enough today. Maybe tomorrow!" Still we stayed. At 4:15 AM my traveling companion woke me to say we had to leave. She was sick as could be eyes stuck together and coughing her head off. We called down and asked for another room explaining our problem and were told :Check back at 7 AM. Somebody will be here then." By 6 we were packed and out of there. The good thing I will say is that the young lady in charge of the day shift was very nice and did show us a "renovated" room. It smelled like chemicals so we left and went to the hotel Expedida was good enough to transfer us to. We were both sick with "allergic bronchitis" for our entire cruise.,oubookgirl
UR126682648,2012-26-March,This is the WORST hotel EVER..It should be listed as an Motel a very seedy one at that. Booked for 4 nights and dIdn't even stay 1 went to the San Juan Sheraton. Booked through Expedia and they changed for 1 night and in the process of getting that refunded as well. You get what you pay for and the reviewers that are saying its not so bad they must be employees or relative of the employees that work at this dump or their not travelers use to staying in decent hotels.,Skylar D
UR126465028,2012-21-March,Good location we stayed for one night before joining Cruise. Bed and toilet clean. Carpet dirty. Room fittings in need of replacement. Good quality Flatscreen TV with US channels. Big room but needs refurbishment urgently. OK for one night but condition of room would drive you to go elsewhere. Noise for adjacent room and ocean high in room we had on 3rd floor. Reception resturant and outside bar good pool poor but narrow beach about 5M from rear of hotel.,AlanandMags
UR128007778,2012-16-April,it was a night mare room was dirty the bed cover had a big yellow stain on it the lamp was full of rust and meldow the bath tub was dirty and had meldowthe window curtains had stains on it and was only a see thru curtains. we ended going to a diffrent hotel and they still charge me for 1 night!,Posted by a cheaprooms.com traveler
UR124496844,2012-12-February,The worst service I've ever encountered zero servicemindedness. On top of this the rooms are pretty lousy no one ever cleaned ours even when we hung out our sign (which apparently you had to do to get them done up) there was a blood stain on our sheets and there's no breakfast even available to pay extra for. They've poured all their assets into the exterior which as a result looks nice but inside the rooms are far less impressive. When you open the window in the bedroom the ceiling in the bathroom is lifting (since its the type of ceiling you'd find in an office). When we asked to cancel our reservation at 7.30pm after having been denied check-in at 3pm because they "had so much laundry to do" they put up a fight and refused to let us off without paying. It took threats and two calls to their boss before we were allowed to leave this lousy excuse for a hotel. DON'T STAY THERE.,AnnisNumberOne
UR99442767,2011-8-March,We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights and were very disappointed. It looks great when you enter the lobby but thats about all that good in this hotel. They did not clean on room on the second day and then took 30 minutes and 2 phonecalls to bring us towels and toiletpaper that evening. The lobby is understaffed and we often had to wait too long when handing in keys and getting our car. there is no parking so you are forced to have it in valet which they of course charge for and then make you wait forever when you want to get your car. they ran out of towels on a daily basis and we even overheard them apologising to another couple for not having enough pillow cases. great location but would definately not stay there again.,saffa2011
UR103041232,2011-6-April,Stayed here for three nights after a cruise in April 2011. The room was large but carpeted the furniture was older chairs had multiple stains carpet was stained cleanliness was barely acceptable. The biggest problem with this hotel was the room was DAMP the entire room had a very damp moldy smell papers left in the room for a day felt almost wet everything was damp and running the air conditioner seemed to make it worse. There is a pool and deck area but there is no beach just rocks. A nice swimming beach is just a few minutes walk away.,YVRguy34
UR115065071,2011-5-July,Stay away from this so called Hotel  Rude staff very dirty hotel..pillows with mildew ..elevators always wet ...and i will share some pictures of room 511 the tub and i have no more to say....how can the rent rooms like this.,cynthia019
UR110124830,2011-27-May,We asked for 2 rooms one beside the other the day I made my reservation over the phone Jessica is the Reservation employee she said "OK"  then when we arrived they gave us a room on floor 7 and the other on floor 3 when we went to the room and opened it it was OCCUPIED!!!!! Yes there were guests' in the room they didn't see us because I think that they weren't inside when I went to tell Jessica what had happend she said "Oh sorry"....we asked to talk to the manager and we never saw him in the three days we were there. I do not recommend it at all. Poor service.,travel_agent_Queb
UR101717253,2011-27-March,Just got off b2b cruise needed a room for one night before boarding another ship. So we were just looking for clean & safe place to stay. I booked on expedia and ended up paying $180 this place is worth about $50 (maybe). Rooms are very spartan sheets may have been laundered but not pressed so wrinkled and thin they stuck to you. The bathroom had a bug crawling about. The phone and tv looked new. The hallway looked like a skid row building. the elevators are scary as they shake going up & down. Bottom line...Do not stay here at any price.,Cliffday
UR115768686,2011-25-July,The staff was rude had to wait over an hour past the check in time for an available room no valet parking was available so i had to drive 4 blocks to find a location was told to check back the second day for parking (but there wasn't any then either so i ended up returning the rental car mid trip) wi-fi doesn't work in the room was told that someone would fix it and 24 hours later the problem still exists no phone in the room so i have to go to the lobby to speak to anyone only one elevator works in the 10 story building the carpet is rolling and stained (very large spots) in multiple locations there's no mattress pad under the sheets the mattresses are decades old and very squishy the trim is falling off the wall the windows are stated to open but don't the windows are filthy so you can't enjoy the view of the ocean (I can go on but these are the first few items that came to mind...),timv1977
UR122007110,2011-22-December,My husband and I stayed at the SJ Beach hotel 5 years ago it was the economical traveler's dream. We thought we would return for our anniversary and a trip down memory lane. Only the SJ beach hotel's room quality has taken a drastic nose dive. We were given 3 different rooms after complaints about broken toilets no lights non working phones non working shower stained sheets dirty bathrooms and paint fumes (from the nighttime maintenance). Each room we were given was in worse condition only the room rate stayed the same. After returning to the front desk for the 4th time we checked out after 1hr. and demanded a refund and refused to accept the 4th room offer. The tragic part is the staff seemed unsurprised about the fact that basic amenities such as bathrooms and lights were in non working order in all of the rooms we were given. We are frequent visitors to Puerto Rico and have stayed in many places there are too many other options to spend your money elsewhere for a decent clean safe stay in the same location. Run don't walk away from this hotel!! The only thing that will upset you more from staying at this property is to have paid hard earned money to do so.,mzkimd
UR117032586,2011-21-August,The pictures on the hotels websites are misleading the lobby and adjacent restaurant are very nice but that is where everything ends. Turn the corner to get on the elevator and you enter the hall of despair. The rooms are dirty humid insufficent insulation which makes the bed linens moldy and the bed and carpet damp. The bathroom was outdated and the bathtub was rusty and the ceiling panel was falling down. This was the secod room I was given after I complained about the first room which was actually worse. The parking garage is scary and I suggest don't attempt to access your car after dark. The location is good right on a bus route but it is also a frequent hangout for the homeless after dark. The service was not bad but there is just not so much they can do to make the hotel better.,jean b
UR97372575,2011-20-February,Our mediocre experience started right when checking in. Basically they gave us a room with two single beds instead of the king-size we booked. The only explanation they gave was that the hotel was full and that they run out of king-size bed rooms. In other words they gave our room to someone else. So we get to our rooms expecting to get something at least similar to what we saw in the website and so happened that the hotel is undergoing renovations and not all the rooms were fixed. The room we got was worse than what you would get at a cheap motel: Dirty and humid carpets  strong mildew smell old furniture no safe box ornamental phone (didnt even work) the so called "lagoon view" was actually a view to a piece of lagoon across the street through a very dirty window. Sleep quality was awful. The sheets were humid to the point of being sticky. The noises coming from the street (honks and loud car stereo) made it impossible to sleep unless you used earplugs. Bottom line: - Poor overall cleanliness. Hallways and room smell to mildew. - Noisy if you get a room with "lagoon view" - No breakfast - The hotel has a good location and friendly staff however I do not recommend this hotel.,DatHalifax
UR119484873,2011-19-October,Hotel is heavily infested with roaches. complained 3 times to staff with no response. Roaches were crawling across the old mattresses and on the walls. My feet were sticking to the moldy rugs.,Chango A
UR116946484,2011-19-August,This is an old hotel ... Therefore on would not expect perfection. I think for about half of the 87 dollar price one could not complain too much but at the "special" price of 87 dollars in my opinion I'd stay away. I got the phone number and tried to book direct but no one woulod answer the phone so I did book thru an online booking entity. When I mentioned this to the hotel clerk her response was ... "Yeah ... the phones don't work good" ... Ho Hum ..... There are some smaller hotels in the area that aren't bad but most are not found via a booking entity. If you are on a tight budget you might suffer through this place .... Keep in mind that I AM being critical because I did not enjoy my stay here but you have to make up your own mind. I've listed what in my opinion are the good and the not so good below. Keeping in mind that this is only my opinion...! I do recommend Puerto Rico but not this hotel. Here's a list of things that were good: 1. Air conditioner worked very well. 2. Lobby and restaurant looked very nice 3. Bed linens appeared to be clean Here's a list of things that were not so good: 1. Phone problems 2. Two different types of bugs in the room 3. Terrible TV reception maybe 2 or 3 viewable stations 4. TV remote did not work 5. Hair in the shower 6. Old old old furnishings 7. Room doors scuffed and scarred 8. No safety chain on the door 9. Light shades just "Hanging" on the lamps not attached 10. Drink machines did not work 11. No ice bucket in the room. 12. Lackluster attitude by font dest personnel,DeepDewDew
UR93645565,2011-18-January,About 15years ago I stayed at the Hotel San Juan at it was an absolute pleasure. I recently stayed at this hotel as a family vacation and they managed to ruin the vacation for me and my family. It started when I did check-in at 4pm and did not give me a room until 6:30pm when I complained a woman named Mara (manager) gave me a lot of attitude and was really rude. I had also asked for a room that was not on top of their dance club becuase I have a baby and they put right on top of the dance club. When I got to the room I was really really disappointed the bathrooms full of mold phone did not work bathroom door was broken security box was broken rooms dirty hallways smelled of mildew..... I called the front desk for them to repair the security box and the phone and they gave me attitude about it and sent someone an hour later.... A pipe broke on the third floor and it flooded the second first and the lobby... They only had one waiter in the pool are so if you ordered chicken tenders they would get to you a long time after.... It was a disaster!!!! A motel 8 would have been better. The funny thing is that the intercontinental hotel is down the road and the rooms are cheaper and better. That is what we ended up doing.,MAAM03
UR121843994,2011-18-December,I was staying in room 601 which was very dirty old sheets were stained. Carpet was horrible bath tub was broken and rusty; and wait....BED BUGS...!!!! I talked to the staff at the front desk and changed to room 711 which was worst and even more BED BUGS. Don't be fooled by lobby online pictures it's truly nasty dirty and please do not stay here.....,Crustinag
UR104081962,2011-14-April,Personal items and computer(ipad) got stolen. Manager lack of proffessionalism(Jorge [--]) poor services and cooperation with me and the police. He told me that he questioned all maids and checked all maid's lockers for the items stolen.(As if the maids were going to accept that they stole the items or if they were going to keep them in the building). Not follow up with the investigation at all. Had to call him over 10 times for info and reimbursment. (told me he had to clean his desk before start working in order to help me to find my stuff) There are not cameras in the floors no security during the day. Worst experience ever as a traveler military and as a pilot.,pr_islander7
UR99903714,2011-12-March,I stayed at this place for 6 nights (March 2nd through March 8th). I read a lot of reviews so I thought I knew what I was going to get but I was wrong! I was expecting a 2.5 to 3 star hotel for a really great price but it was more like an overpriced .5 to 1 star motel. The place is a real dump. It ruined my vacation. I didn't spend much time in the room but after a day of sightseeing or being at the beach I dreaded heading back to the rooms. The staff was extremely rude especially the manager named Jessica. The rooms were disgusting. They say they are renovating but I didn't see any work being done. It looks like they gave the lobby a cheap makeover (I say cheap because it looks like it is already falling apart) but the rooms haven't been touched. The elevators were old and shook the whole time going up or down. The carpet was stained and smelled like mold was growing under it. When we first walked in our room on the 9th floor it looked like all they did was make the bed. There was still garbage in the drawers and it was definitely not vacuumed. The TV was old and we only got reception for 4 or 5 channels. CNN HLN & TNT were the only channels we could watch. They didn't even have ABC CBS NBC or FOX (I really wanted to watch American Idol!). They still use metal keys instead of card keys which you have to leave with the front desk if you want your room cleaned. We did this but all they did was make the bed. The sheets werent changed and they floor still wasnt vacuumed. Also if you lost the key they were going to charge you $75. The room had two medium sized windows that faced the beach but they were very old and didn't stay open. If we wanted to smell fresh air we had to hold them open which was difficult because they were very heavy. The day after we checked in Jessica and two other hotel employees came banging on our door asking to come in to smell our room because they suspected that we were smoking in the room. I told her this was ridiculous because neither of us smoke! She gave me a dirty look as if I was lying to her and threatened to charge me $250. Meanwhile almost everyday we smelled smoke in the hall which was definitely not coming from our room. The day we were checking out I realized I didn't have cash for the taxi to take us to the Airport ($20 from the hotel) so I asked the doorman to watch our bags while we ran to the store 3 blocks away to use the ATM. When we returned our bags were missing. We tried to ask him where our bags were but he brushed us off and said wait. I knew something wasn't right because I couldn't see my bags anywhere. I had to go to the front desk to have them ask him where our bags were. The doorman had put our bags in someone else's taxi. I freaked out because I thought our bags were gone for good. Thankfully there was taxi driver hanging out outside the hotel who happened to know the driver who had our bags. He called him up on his cell and had him meet us at the airport to give us back our bags. We barely made our flight home. This place was a nightmare. While we were staying there we decided to check out some of the other hotels in the area to compare to what we were staying in. The difference was night & day. If you can spend just a little bit more I would stay at the Holiday Inn Express. It looked clean the staff was friendly and it was just a short walk to the beach. If you need to stay in the same price range as the San Juan Beach Hotel or want to be closer to the beach stay at the Sandy Beach Hotel or the Atlantic Beach Hotel. Both of those are cleaner and in a better location. They are right on the beach in a part where you can actually swim. I just wish someone else had told me this before I booked my vacation.,moyteali
UR103549112,2011-10-April,We stayed here for a nite before a cruise in February 2007 we had reserved an oceanfront room when we got there we were told that one was not available. $10 made one suddenly open up- but it was horrible. damp room stained sheets moldy lampshades - missing lightbulbs. shower and bathroom was dirty soap had been used. we were told that the hotel was being remodeled and refurnished one floor at a time but reading these recent reviews i guess nothing has changed. i'm amazed that they could stay in business.,rotarymike
UR63454120,2010-6-May,Well...I thought I the reviews were poisoned pen heavy handed spoiled brat comments. We checked out May 2 2010 and will just forfeit our second trip we have prepaid for November 2010. We found such a great price that we booked and prepaid for two extended weekend stays. Don't stay at this hotel unless you find a rate of $15.00 per night or less (after taxes). A homeless person would think this hotel is just OK. I have figured out what is happening here. Someone got a great lease deal on this building and is doing as little to operate as possible and using this "hotel" as a cash cow. Dirty moldy smelly yucky. The pool area is saturated with cigarette butts. As you walk up to the main entrance trash greets you. If you are wondering why this hotel costs over $100.00 less than those on either side it's because this place is really bad...not tolerable. This is the first time I have written a review...I feel obliged to warn other travelers. You don't travel to San Juan to stay in a flop house do you?? OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Kennn
UR57876973,2010-6-March,This Hotel should honestly be shut down. I often travel to Puerto Rico aprox 4-6 x's a year. I stayed at this hotel last year for the first time. I was already under the impression that the hotel was undergoing renovations this has been the excuse for the past three years. Our room was ok not the best but also not the worst. for the price and location i decided to stay here again this year. I must begin by saying that I made my reservations 3 Months prior to my arrival date. I confirmed my reservations twice. We arrived in san juan on the night of Feb 18th at 10pm. Once we got to the hotel they were oversold and had no rooms the staff was the most unprofessional useless unfriendly and all of the above team i have ever came accross in my life. After exactly 2 hours they finally gave us a key to a room at midnight. We get into our room and what a disgust!. Mold coming through the ceiling paint no towels stained floors old moldy carpeting exposed wires rust covered lamp shades and ceiling edges no room service poorly ventelated foul smell and best of all blood stained sheet and the different shades of grey towels which once were white. YES blood stained sheets the pictures are below as proof of what a disgusting place to stay at. This room was obviously not up to parr to accomodate any guest it was an insult to the mear delicassy of my nature. after discovering the blood stained sheets i demanded a full refund and to be immidiately checked out. The staff even thretened to call the police on me because i was so upset this too was funny as my father is a high powered judge in Puerto Rico. After exhausting all resouces they were forced to return our money and check us out of the hotel. I was literally in this hotel for a total of 12 hours and i witnessed 5 other people/groups cheching out and demanding refunds as well because of similar situations. This is not a good reputation this hotel is trailing behind. The trick here is that they have only one floor which is updated and it is the 10th floor so if you do stay here make sure that you are accomodated on the 10th floor. this hotel is a disguise when you arrive  the lobby looks amazing as well as the pool the bar and the entrance thats about it. once u get in the elevator ang go up it all changes. I will never stay here again or even reconsider it because of the poor staff and of course terrible experience this hotel has too many competitors that are much finer around them so why settle for less.,jsal83
UR59685378,2010-27-March,I read a lot of the reviews before staying here. I thought maybe some were being too critical. I have stayed in some inexpensive motels before and have never been as dissatisfied as I was with this one. We had to remind the front desk every day to get enough towels. One day we even ran out of toilet paper and had to wait hours to get it. The bathroom was moldy and dirty the air conditioner was loud and would not keep the room at an even temp. The beds were the worst I've ever slept on and my pillow was even moldy. You can't use the beach at the motel and the lagoon view is of a parking lot. Do yourself a favor and stay somewhere else.,gasman848
UR59525502,2010-25-March,After travelling extensively throughout the US this hotel has to take first place as the worst of the worst. Dirty moldy dark and dank rooms. Slow and unresponsive staff. Cannot believe they are open for booking. Someone involved here does not have a conscience. San Juan should be ashamed that this hotel is included in their offerings as anything but a flea bag hotel.,renownedauthor
UR62025790,2010-20-April,It does not really have a beach for starters. The dumpster that holds the garbage is right at the Entrance of the Lobby.The staff that we met in the lobby were not very friendly. The staircase is roped off not to be used. The elevator is not even with the floors when you stop.The rooms are not clean and the bathrooms are a disgrace. We checked in and out within 15 minutes luckily we were able to get a room down the street. The only thing this place has going for it is the location.,lonny_10
UR53865801,2010-19-January,Booked with Expedia desk clerk took confirmation info then hotel double billed after I left. Expedia trying to help their accountant said they would fix it. It has almost been a month and still not resolved. Next call is to BBB and police. No wash rags still under construction loud gay parties at the bar never warned about that one. Absolute misery would not have my enemy stay there.,FlyingBard
UR64547650,2010-18-May,I don't have photos like some of the other reviewers but this place was crappy. My room smelled like mildew as did the hallway and elevator. The wifi frequently didn't work. The website makes this look like a pretty nice hotel and I will say that the staff were nice and the bar looked nice but the rest of it was awful. The location wasn't bad but there are plenty of places in San Juan that are well located. I will stay somewhere else next time.,daddyogrande
UR56381048,2010-18-February,Got a pretty good deal on this room in Condado area of San Juan. Pretty good location. They are in the midst of construction. Lobby looked pretty nice though in a stark boutique hotel kinda way. But vibe was very quiet. You have to walk through lounge to access back of hotel which was strange. Back has pool overlooking the beach & a deck with several chaise lounges. Beach area is tiny & you cannot swim on this area of beach as waves are dangerous ... a drawback. Rooms are very large but had not been redone yet. Although it looks like furniture is new. When we got to room late at night we had not hot water and we realized bed had NO BLANKET on it or anywhere in the room. Just a thin sheet flat sheet on both top & bottom. No mattress pad either. We called for blanket but waited a long time. We finally canceled order as we needed to sleep & did not someone knocking on door late at night. They told us hot water was broken & would not be fixed for another 15 hours. They did not alert us to this fact upon check in. Upon check out they did agree to refund us $20. Hotel seemed very understaffed.,NYadventuregirl
UR64408373,2010-17-May,This hotel is a health hazard. From the quality of the lifts to the state of the bedrooms this hotel is to be avoided at all costs. It is safer to sleep in the building site on the other side of the road that gives this hotel its so called Lagoon View option. The details say the hotel was renovated in 2009. This is not true only the downstairs areas have been done. DO NOT BE CONNED BY THE GLITZY WEBSITE OR THE POOL AREA! (Not one of the chairs or recliners around the pool were complete and servicable). On arrival one is pleasantly surprised at the refit but as soon as the lift doors open on the accommodation floor you immediately know you have made a big mistake. The coridors are dark and grubby and the fittings date back tonthe 50s. On entering my room none of the lights worked so I had to wait for several bulbs and plugs to be replaced. The room was dark damp and electrical fittings would be condemned under UK standards. I booked a Lagoon View .... sounds nice?? The lagoon is a stretch of water the other side of the busy main road and can only be seen as there is a building site/ car park on the oposite side of the road. This should have been described as MainRoad and Skip View!! Then I saw the bathroom... There was black mould on the shower curtains the bath was dirty and the taps were a health hazard. The bathroom ceiling was even worse dripping with black spores and mould. Musty smells were from both bathroom and bedroom. Could it get worse???? Yes it could... Below is a nightclub/bar and taxis collecting and dropping people off using their horns thoughout the night was only drowned by the ancient air conditioning. Did this spoil my night's sleep??? No it couldn't as none of the bolts were fitted to the bed frame so the bed collapsed one side during the night anyway! The promised Breakfast before 10.30 had ran out of juice coffee and any food by 10.05 though once the other problems were brought to the attention of the hopeless manager he promised to get me some breakfast.. This was later changed to $4.99 so I could go down the street in the heavy rain for a Breakfast at Subway. Neither materialised so I went without.... thankful for a bottle of water I had left from my long flight the day before. Surely this couldn't get worse??? Yes it could!!! I checked out the hotel at 11am and headed to my Cruise on Royal Caribbean Adventure of the Seas -- That afternoon my neck and chest broke out into a fungal rash that spoilt the rest of my 2 week holiday sailing the Atlantic to Barcelona and then home to London. I still have patches on my chest that now won't tan over and I need to see a skin specialist. Would I recommend this hotel to a friend...?? Not even to my worse enemy as he could easily sue me for negligence or malice. Avoid -- Avoid -- Avoid. ps... I left the Hotel Manager a list of my complaints and he promised to email me an explanation and an offer... however now over 2 weeks later there has been no such response!,jaygee1243
UR58802270,2010-17-March,The hotel is dingy with stained carpeting peeling paint on walls in several rooms. Several members of my family stayed at this hotel one room had what looked like black mold on the carpet and water runnng down the sides of the walls. No pictures on the wall and only one light in the room . When two of our family awoke the next day we had what appeared to be several red mosquito looking bites on our legs. Peeling paint was present in three of the four rooms we occupied. Two showers did not work. The view is beautiful outside but what you have to look at inside is not a fair exchange for the view. Hotel service is very slow. Don't stay here! Not worth saving a few dollars.,Joyfulheart08
UR71284435,2010-17-July,This hotel was very uncomfortable I saw ROACHES all over the place. They were in the restroom inside the alarm clock on the ice machine and by the food. If you have a car you can only valet park. The staff is nice but the conditions of the hotel was not good at all.,letyserrano
UR61720092,2010-17-April,I am a local and had some issues with the hotel management and cant figure anybody staying here. I feel sorry for the people who do.,Ricklat
UR57447144,2010-1-March,AVOID THIS HOTEL! This sorry excuse for a hotel is laughable at best and criminal at the very worst. The front desk agents informed me that my reservation made weeks in advance had been "lost" when I arrived. They then proceeded to give both me and Hotwire.com staff the run around for over an hour claiming that they had no available rooms. The male front desk attendant then said to the female attendant in Spanish (as if no one can understand Spanish) that when they receive discounted bookings via Hotwire and Orbitz they simply resell the rooms at higher prices if possible. He later hung up on the rep from Hotwire.com right in front of me. Luckily Hotwire was able to book me in a decent property down the street. The hotel's manager best described as a blue-collar "tough" stood by the front desk with a notebook listing all of the guests with Spanish surnames. When they arrived he greeted them warmly and invited them to have a nice stay and enjoy the free continental breakfast on the second floor. When English speakers arrived he pretended to see through them. If you value your money time dignity and sanity you will steer clear of this place.,PrinceKusi
UR66078297,2010-1-June,I had purchased 2 nights at this hotel on an internet site... But when we got to the hotel I had to call the site and cancel the reservation and fight for my money back beacuse this hotel was absolute HELL! I have never seen anything like this. The photos are VERY deceiving... Beware! DO NOT STAY HERE! I am normally very opne to everything and have stayed in very cheap hotels before... this was beyond anything I can possibly describe!,Cate0817
UR60061446,2010-1-April,do not stay here!! it is not worth saving a few dollars as one of the other reviews read!... my girls and i stayed here the first night we arrived to puerto rico we figured we'd stay in pr for one night prior to going on our cruise. the experience at this hotel was a terrible way to start our vacation!... the bathroom was terrible the bath tub was disgusting there was no knob to turn the shower on the hallways smelled like mold the carpet was stained and looked as if there were layers of dirt. the beds were not well made and the comforter looked as if it had not been washed. there was no bed skirt on the bed so you were able to see the box-spring and the mattress was disgusting!! you were also able to see the frame of the bed and the wheels were bending so i was afraid that with any lil' move the bed would collapse. i had read the previous reviews but i had already booked the room .. and i figured what the heck i'll give it the benefit of the doubt... sure enough my girl-friends and i were totally disgusted!!!... mold everywhere and according to the receptionist the hotel is being "remodeled". i did some research and its been awhile that this hotel is supposedly being "remodeled". seriously this hotel should be shut down!... luckily we only had to stay there one night. we slept all covered up on top of our towels on top of the comforter and still you could feel the dam wires of the mattress poking your back!... we definetly didn't want to un do the bed cause who knows what the heck would be under the comforters. check out the photos of the bathroom!... SICK!!!,Q2daEeQT
UR23363409,2009-7-January,Worst hotel in PR! New York City projects are cleaner then this hotel! It was discusting !! mildew mold damp and just nasty !! Don't bother spending your money at this place. The bar has locals hanging out who are still in High School!! it was a hoodlumm spot for the locals!!!!!,lainieah
UR36920958,2009-6-August,This hotel should be shut down until it is truly remodeled and duly inspected. There are safety hazards all over the place like dangling electrical cables all over debris and trash even in the lobby windows missing glass in area between lobby and pool expired fire extinguishers expired elevator permit moldy and smelly rooms... On top of that the service is terrible from cold coffee to food shortage and no room service. And the rates are really not that cheap! Check out rates and deals at nearby hotels (like the Caribe Hilton) and for about $25 more per day you can stay at a classy place. San Juan Beach is a total rip off!,LenaViajera
UR45832724,2009-4-October,This hotel was the worse experience of my trip to Miami. I was in vacation with my family and booked this hotel for two nights. I received several obscene phone calls from whom I found out was an employeed of this hotel. I made my complain about this at the front desk  but I was ignored. They probably did not believe me and did nothing about it. I would NEVER go back to this hotel. Never take your kids to this place.I DO NOT recommend to stay in this terrible place ever!,InconformeMexico
UR29306574,2009-4-May,First and foremost I never take time to write reviews but I am so against this Nasty Hotel that I want to take time out of my schedule to write it!!! We got married in February and honeymooned in PR. We made reservations here because it was in the Condado District and that is where alot of cool spots are in San Juan. Well needless to say we arrive at around midnight and when we walk in we noticed this horrible smell and NO ONE is at the front desk...NO ONE....I couldn't believe it....so my husband asked where the person was and the so called bell man told us "oh he went to buy something to drink across the street"...we looked at each other in shock....the man returns to the desk and he was like "Welcome to San Juan Beach Hotel" and I wanted to tell him "Welcome back to your job"....anyway my husband asked him how were the rooms and he kept ignoring our question and proceeded to check us in....after checking us in...we noticed this HORRIBLE SMELL was all over the hotel....I told my husband let's just check it out before we make assumptions....Well we went into the elevator that is the smallest elevator I have ever been in...and I notice the Elevator has not been inspected in June 2008...I was like "OH NO we need to leave"....so we go into the room and we walked into the most GROSS ROOM I have ever seen it smelled and the comforter was outdated...the bed didn't have a head board no phone in the room the AC was leaking this nasty water into the carpet. the towels looked used for about 10 years....it was digusting....WE LEFT!!! We went to the lobby and the man had the nerve to say "Oh what didn't you like"....We were like "WHAT"....I told him in Spanish...because I am Puerto Rican....I told him I don't even think ROACHES LIVE IN YOUR HOTEL....this is DISGUSTING...we demanded our money back he refunded us and then tried to penalize us for a night but we fought and our bank went after them and we got our money back IMMEDIATELY....... Moral of the story...don't be fooled by the "Great Deal of the price"....spend the extra money to feel comfortable....This place needs to be SHUT DOWN ASAP!!! It shouldn't be open at all..they are in so many violations I don't know how they are still open!!! Its nasty disgusting and the people that are there match the hotel.... The only REGRET I have is not taking PICTURES to show how disgusting it was!!! We ended up staying at the Embassy Suites in Isla Verde which was HEAVEN compared to this awful place.... STAY AWAY FROM SAN JUAN BEACH HOTEL.....,vasti11
UR48456320,2009-3-November,We booked this hotel for 4 days. After entering our room we realized we made a huge mistake. it was just terrible the room was smelly the AC made a lot of noise no telephones in the room no towels no soap. Stains on the blankets. The next day we checked out and wanted a confirmation that we only stayed 1 night as a proof for exepdia to get our money back. That was not possible there was no system. The manager was called and it was no problem to give us that paper. When the manager did give us our proof thank god we checked she had put as the date the 4 nights that we were supposed to be in the hotel. After complaining she said we could change it with a pen. NO WAY did we accept this. After receiving the actual paper with the one night that we stayed i asked her why didn't she had it right in the first place. She answered that she thought we were in a hurry. What a shame what a way to try to prevent us from getting our money back. It is a big shame. We checked in in Howard Johnson were we had a wonderful time and just $15 higher in price. They have to shut down this hotel.,lunaAmsterdam
UR33337818,2009-28-June,this was my first and will be my last visit to Puerto Rico!!!!...the hotel was unkept overall. the initial room we had was not "secure" so we switched the second was not any better..the shower curtain in the bathroom had mildew and mold (which we requested to be replaced) the hotel floor had a musty smell...my girlfriends clothes remained "wet" and clammy from the humidity in the room...I slept on top of the sheets because i was scared i might get bed bug!! The hotel towels were not white at all....I was so relieved to go back home just to get a good night rest and take a nice shower!!! they should have shut down the hotel until it is fully renovated but i'm not sure they meant the rooms were part of the deal....Unfortunately i will not return due to this experience..I would be ashamed to recommend this place to anyone McKinney Texas,blkprincess
UR30810726,2009-26-May,The goverment must send the authorities to inspect this hotel and close it until it get remodeled. It is not safe to be there everything they advertised on their web page is a lie. It is the worst hotel I have every seen on my life. We just walked away after being there more than two hours trying to get back our money. Puerto Rico is a beautifull place and the people is really kind. This hotel is a very bad advertising for the beautifull Island please do not stay in this hotel,VenezuelaMarta
UR51912453,2009-26-December,The San Juan Beach Hotel (formerly a Ramada?) 1045 Ashford Avenue San Juan 00907 Puerto Rico. Good points: (1) Room had a good ocean view. (2) Large spacious room Bad points: (1) The room lights were not plugged in properly so we spent some time trying to figure out how to switch on the lights. (2) The batteries in the TV remote were missing had to ask for new batteries. (3) TV did not come with any channel list/guide. (4) The light inside the bathroom was almost dead (couldn't see a thing) had to ask them to install new lights. (5) The bathroom sink was clogged had to ask them to unclog it. (6) The beds did not have any warm blankets had to ask them for it. (7) They had conditioner/shampoo in the bathroom but not a single bar for hand soap anywhere; had to ask them for it. (8) No one picked up the phone when we tried to call the front desk from our room (several times) to inquire about the above. (9) Had to go down to the front desk several times to get them to do the above. (10) The service provider who fixed the above seemed very casual (old T-shirt unshaved); he could be made more professional in appearance. He did seem to be a nice guy who was trying and responding to our needs. So the fault is not his. This means that the blame goes to the management for not running the place professionally. (11) No laundry facilities in hotel and according to them there is no place nearby for laundry. (12) Front desk person didn't seem to be knowledgeable about the immediate area; found this out when we asked for suggestions about local restaurants. Or maybe the person was simply too busy to respond and explain. It seemed that there is just one person in the front desk who is expected to coordinate everything -- and that's humanly impossible for a hotel that is this large. (13) Lamp stands were starting to get rusted. Can see some rust inside the bathroom too. Overall our room was not ready for guests even though we checked in late in the evening and that should have given them enough time to set it up. If a hotel's management can be messed up this is the way to do it. This could make a great case study in a business school --- if anyone wants lessons on how to ignore customers and mess up the management of a hotel come here for a study tour. Best regards Currently a vacationer at Puerto-Rico/Virgin-Islands; and a US business school professor when I am not vacationing.,tripsc
UR43933665,2009-23-September,THis hotel is a DUMP. When i arrived i thought it was a shelter. my kids didn't even want to get out the cab. I asked the women at the front desk WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED HERE? she said we are renovating the lobby. before checking in i viewed the room.. It was worst than the lobby..I was traveling from Atlanta to Puerto Rico for the first time i didn't have any options but to stay for two nights or loose my money.. I paid $240 for the nights. The room was smelly mildew the mirrors fogged up all night the bathroom was filthy the tub was nasty Oh the towels my god the towels were off white. the carpet was stained the phones didn't work the t.v didn't work the radio and the hot water didn't work either. there were numerious ants in the beds. My kids were bitten by the ants so badily they had to give me another room. for the night.. The reservations specialist told me i could enjoy the pool NOT the pool was as dirty as the water in the drains. my son is 4years old the pool started @ 5ft no place for a kid. the pool had debruis from the construction that had fallen.. We had to buy food morning noon and night the area where the breakfast was served was surronded by exposed electrical wires chiped paintsdry walls sheet rocks and Nails on the floor. I had to use my cell phone in the basement even time i went i had to take my kids would of never left them unattend in this hotel  My family in Atlanta was so worried about me. we did get a chance to see Puerto Rico during the day and only returned to the hotel to sleep when the streets were dark. My kids and i had to sneak into another hotel to use the pool. One of the workers asked me if i wanted to go to the roof with him to see the ships sail .. HE HAD THE GAME TWISTED.. to think i was leaving my kids in the room alone..to go have fun with him.. UNprofessional. Don't every every every every think about visiting this place don't even send your worst enemy here. My lesson is to read more reviews befor i pay with my credit card.,honeyicetea
UR23740760,2009-20-January,This hotel is perfectly fine except for one very important and serious problem. The smell and mold that hits you as soon as you come out of the elevator is simply unacceptable. The smell and mold got even worse when I open the door of my room. This hotel has potential and the staff was courteous. But until they replace and maintain a clean carpet/environment staying there is simply unacceptable.,ecalvin2k
UR23639605,2009-17-January,I dont even know where to begin!! Once you walk in the smell of mold mildew and humidity is what greets you!! The ppl working there seriuosly need some classes in professionalism! When we checked in and went to our room the disgusting smell of mold led us all the way to our room and the spots on the carpet were UNBELIEVABLE!! The pictures on their website are COMPLETELY misleading!! Their is no "beach" at this hotel! It was soo ugly it wasnt even worth taking a picture! The pool was small and didnt look clean..not to mention a group of little kids begging for money poolside!!! What kind of professional establishment allows that?!?!?! As soon as my sister and I walked into the room we walked out and immediately went back to the front desk to ask to talk2a manager the young lady at the front desk told us he was unavailable! WTF?!?! We finally got to speak to the manager Luis and he offered to show us a different room but it was just as bad as the first one. To make a loooooong story short after a WHOLE day on the phone with Orbitz(who was giving my sister a problem to get a refund) we stayed 2 days and cut our vacation in half and booked the 1st plane back to NY!! NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!!!,MiiMiiNY
UR24646182,2009-16-February,When first decided to stay in san juan i wanted stay at a hotel for one night so i went on diffrent sites such as hotels.com and tripadvisor i listen to what people said about this hotel but it wasnt enough to detour until i actually got there then waited a hour to check in seriously so if i was you i would stay here for this reason if you dont mind waiting then this place might be cool for you and no beach you have the view but cannot go in water "horrible",ChristopherJos
UR37558360,2009-13-August,Well we booked our carribbean cruise with an agent and within the pacakge they booked us a night in this hotel before the cruise. I am very fussy about where I stay i always book the top hotel when i go on holiday but i was not in charge of the booking this time my auntie was. Anyway after receiving the confirmaton through the post i decided to have a look at some information about the hotel. i saw the reviews on this website and accepted that it would only be a one night stay before i go on a fantastic cruise boat so I will just put up with it for that one night. i even thought maybe all the other reviews were exaggerting a little bit. they weren't! i was in complete shock when i pulled up outside in the taxi . My face just dropped. I have no probelm with hotels undergoing refurbishment just not when i am staying in them. It did look like it could have been a safety hazard and I would not have been happy if i had brought children along. Our toliet also leaked. We had to swop rooms three times because of different problems. it is completely unacceptable for business at the refurbishment stage it is at the moment. I cannot put into words how bad it was. it was not particularly dirty but it was a building site effectively. On a positive note i found the staff to be very friendly and attentive and they made a good effort with breakfast and it was in a nice area with stunning views. it has great potential and I would look forward to seeing the finished building in a few years time. we had dinner at the Condado down the road. it was like a 10* hotel in comparison. I won't name and shame but i am more angry at the agent we booked the holiday with for using the hotel in the state it is in!! Once we were in a our lovely cabin on the cruise we just had to laugh about it!,CruiserUnitedKingdom
UR46690391,2009-12-October,I booked this through expedia and will be contacting them to get my money back. It was terrible beyond anything I can put in words. No phones in rooms WHAT hotel doesn't have phones in the rooms so you are stuck on the 10th floor with no communication with the lobby what if there was an emergency??? Paint falling off wall blood and toothpaste on wall in bathrrom shower stall mold half way up wall molding missing. The beautiful picture of the curved stairway in the ad on expedia is welllllll look at the pictures it is only 2 rails and no stairs it was under construction and there was no front on the lobby it was just open. Weird. Parking fee was $20 a day that was another surprise... and not a pleasent one. Bedspread was stained and floor was dirty old pipes that were capped off nad left. I can't not believe this place really beyond words. Glad it was only one night. I arrived late or I would not have stayed even the one. Please beware of this one!!!!,kimlister
UR29768270,2009-11-May,I never take time to write reviews but I am so against this Hotel that I want to take time out of my schedule to write my first!!! We choose this hotel because it was in the Condado area in San Juan. We arrive at around 8:30 PM and we noticed the hotel is still being remodeled and accepting guest with work still on. I went in with my son and was welcome by the lady at the counter. Next to her was a young gentleman on the phone in the middle of a personal call trying to find a place to watch Pacquiao and Hatton fight. Few days after my stay I found out that the young guy was one of the managers; he looks like straight from High School. That may explain why the hotel runs like crap. The lobby was surrounded by mirrors I could see throw the mirror that the lady at the front counter was writing an email. After 12 minutes of waiting I had to ask "are you going to be long because I can find another hotel". She apologized and after another 2-3 min proceeded to check us in. During the check-in I told the employee I will be living at 400 AM. Because I was not going out that night and I was living early in the morning the gentleman who just finish his personal phone conversation offer me a COMPLIMENTARY valet parking. After few minutes we walk in to our room the room was anything but first class and notice a not so good smell no phone in the room no radio the towels looked used for about 5-10 years.... It is around 930 PM I have 2 kids and a wife tired trying to take a shower and go to sleep I have no other option but to stay and try to sleep at least 4-5 hrs. The bathroom was not clean. The towels once again look used. One time the towels were white that day was browner than white we end up using our own. Around 4:00 AM we went down to get our car and at the front counter I notice someone different (Shift Change). This new person tries to charge me for the COMPLIMENTARY valet offer to me. After 20 min of phone calls I was told no problem Sr. you dont have to pay for the parking. Few days later after looking my bank account I noticed a charge for $21.40 for the valet parking. I have call every person in the hotel. I was told by the front desk the manager is with another client can I get your name and phone number and he will contact you once he is free. Never receive the call and had to call back 2 days later. Speaking with the manager I found out he was never with a client. The person who answer the phone was the same person who check me in. After an agreement with the manager I sent all information requested and I still waiting for my money to be return. I will let my bank fight to get our money back...... I took time to write here because I am so disappoint with this hotel. Also I want you visitors to understand the San Juan Beach Hotel is not Puerto Rico. I am 100% Puertorrican and I love my Island. Puerto Rico is an Honest and Beautiful place just be award of people like those operating the SJ Beach Hotel. Spend the extra money to feel comfortable. This place needs to be SHUT DOWN!!!,Siquito1
UR37368651,2009-11-August,The hotel gave the impression that was being remodeled. My cab driver asked me if I wanted him to wait and check if indeed open for business. Besides a lobby with exposed wiring one elevator running check in was caotic. No reservation list to confirmed reservations. Making people wait till 3 p.m. to register was a joke. The hotel was empty so what was the wait? The lobby was not fixed for guest s waiting not a coffee bar or any other such facilities. I never witness any one cleaning the pool so I did not go in it. The beach area was not for swimming--too many rocks. One had to go a ways to find a swiming beach. Their Web is misleading. The rooms smell mildew ants in the bed and all of my clothes were constantly damp.,caterinaZ
UR25942783,2009-10-March,Every website I checked regarding the reviews to this hotel were pretty accurate. About 85% of the reviews were negative/poor while the remaining 15% were positive/average. I booked my vacation through Hotels.com and I will never book through them again. They will do and tell you just about anything to book your package! Hotels.com promised me smoking rooms only to find out the hotel was smoke-free and would not even work with me to change hotels. I got to this hotel at about 5:30AM after flying for 4 hours and was told checkout was at 3:00PM! Hotels.com never explained that to me. I ended up waiting till 7:00AM for his supervisor to show up only to tell us that we had to pay an extra $50.00 per room as an early check-in fee. And we had 3 rooms! After a tremendously long wait we ended up in our rooms sometime after 11:00AM. As for the condition of the rooms SHABBY. Holes in curtains bedspreads stains in carpets pretty much what the reviews on here described. I couldn't believe it. I don't really follow reviews but I'm definitely going to take other people's reviews into consideration from now on.,EmDeeLuv
UR17622967,2008-7-July,I had my destination wedding here and through that event had a terrible experience here at this hotel. But putting the event aside I wanted to inform readers of the actual hotel. Hotel is what people would label for male teenagers. The hotel is not what you could call comfy or classy. They had neon blue lights everywhere. Reminds me of a sleazy adult video set. The hotel has nice potential but needs remodeling and some definite cleaning! The conceierge and the front desk were nice but the upper managment carries the immpression that they do not really care to help you out in a situation with the hotel. The only thing this hotel has got going for them is the fantastic view of the ocean and being only steps away from the beach. I would not recommend this to families but is suitable for partying people only staying for a night or two. But the bar is so loud during the weekend and you can hear it all from your room. The regular rooms are small with hardly any closet space. But the suites are much roomier but not a good value for the price of the hotel. This is not a good place to stay for longer then a couple of days.,jessng83
UR22525297,2008-7-December,This hotel was a grossly misrepresented on the website overpriced for the quality and the epitome of a roach motel. When we first arrived we entered our rooms to find the overwhelming stench of mold and mildew slap us in the face. We decided to tough out the first night as it was very late and we were exhausted. As we layed in our beds the smell of the sheets pillows and mattress was nauseating. I could only compare it to leaving your clothes in the washer for a month -wet. Then I decided to take a shower and took my first step into a slimy tub with a black bottom and mildew and mold stains. Showering in flip flops would not resolve this issue as the shower would not drain. The second stay - we complained about the room believing that they would clean the sheets tub etc and we would be able to finish the remainder of our stay at this hotel. Instead we returned to find the same stench in the beds and dirty bath. Then we realized that there was living mold and mildew on the ceiling and walls. See photos attached. We then informed the hotel manger that we would like to check out and would not be staying for the remainder of our visit but they refused to give us our money back. We decided to check out anyway as this hotel was a health violation and obviously no cleaning guidelines are enforced. I don't recommend this hotel at all. There isn't really a beach view either. Stay in a Motel 6 before here - Please.,binky2008
UR15626065,2008-4-May,After a hard working but amazing winter season in Aspen CO me and my friend decided to go to a deserved vacation and our mind was set on Puerto Rico--a Carribean paradise. We booked and paid the San Juan Beach Hotel through Expedia for the period from April 19th to April 29th 2008. After arriving to the hotel the first thing they asked me was to give them my credit card without any explanation. Since all the other people checking in were doing that and since I was tired from the trip I just gave it to them. The room was pretty spacious with an amazing view of the ocean but was old needed thorough redecorating and most of all had a very strong moldy smell so we had to buy an air freshener immediately. After a few days on April 22nd when I checked my bank account I noticed that the hotel had taken 250$ off my card without notifying me and without my authorization. When I asked the front desk what was the meaning of that they said that it was just a security deposit and that it will be returned to me 48 hours after checking out. I protested for not being notified about that but just wanted to continue my vacation. When I checked out at noon on April 29th they wanted to charge me for parking but I protested strongly to the manager since I had no car so they removed that charge and my balance due was 0$. On May 1st after I`d returned to Colorado I found out that instead of my 250$ deposit being returned to me another 250$ were taken off my card by the San Juan Beach Hotel without notifying me and without my authorization!!! When I called them they said they charged me for smoking in the room which is outrageous because they have smoke detectors so any smoke would trigger an alarm and I am not insane to smoke in a smoke-free area! Apparently they just made up an excuse to take extra money from me! Now I am trying to get my 500$ back through the law system and I had to cancel my card so the hotel could not steal any more money from me. The bottom line is: Stay as far away from the San Juan Beach Hotel in Puerto Rico as possible!!!!!,dannyboygaga
UR14657623,2008-30-March,We stayed at the San Juan Beach hotel for a week in March 2008. The front desk staff was exceptionally helpful and courteous the ocean-side view was wonderful and despite the activity over spring break our room was very quiet. Our room was decent but nothing to write home about...the A/C emitted a moldy smell (but we opened the windows and that took care of it) some of the paint was peeling (but we didn't even notice that until the 3rd day) a piece of the bathroom ceiling sagged and we did have at least one scary hair blob in the bed. We felt somewhat boxed in along the Condado since the best night life seemed to be in Old San Juan (~$15 cab ride each way). But if you are expecting to be out and about for most of the day and are just looking for a good place to crash the San Juan Beach fits the bill. Enjoy!,Ca-lammity
UR18432697,2008-30-July,I do not know where to start. It was a total mess. Hotel lobby small dirty cheap looking and broken looking. Staff members clothing tacky old and worn. Rooms and corrider dirty and smelly. Room carpet and bathroom floors were dirty upon arrival shower curtain were moldy furniture cover were torn under sheets multiple black spots. I have a autoimmune disease and travel with my injections which must be stored in a refrigerator well you guessed it there was no refrig. My husband and I stayed 4 dys and on the last day instead of enjoying we chose to go to the airport 8 hrs before schedule time to get a earlier flight. we only slept here. We get up in the mornings and walk around San Juan eat and hang out by La Concha and the Marriot then come by in the evening have a shower and go walk the streets and hang out in other hotels. I do not recommend this hotel at all..Its a NO NO!!!!! Pay a $100 more for your comfort. Its not worth the dirt and unsanitary conditions!!!,VGMSBR
UR19725401,2008-3-September,I arrived and stood at the front desk while two male employees I think managers had their conversation while I waited at least 5 minutes RIGHT in front of them before one of them even acknowledged me. The room was ok but that was all. no ice machines on the floors that I saw you'll be lucky to connect to the internet I was on the 5th floorI was SOL with the internet. The lobby was clean but around the premises it was questionable. also there is no beach at their hotel i guess it washed away. Simply put its not worth I know its the cheapest but you'll be better off spending a few more dollars.,pjoya
UR13949439,2008-29-February,This place was moldy it was dirty it was horrible! No beach to swim. Moldy towels pillows are all due to the fact that there is no ventalation! Ants crawling over our beds. And very loud "Reggaton" music on Sat. night that you can here up to the 10th floor! Wow the vanderbilts need to buy this place and bring it to the ground! Feel sorry for the new vanderbilt hotel next door.,caca_8
UR15407074,2008-27-April,We booked this hotel thru Travel Impressions for over $150 a night. This is an older Hotel on Ashford ave. They are remodeling it but it needs a lot of improvements b4 anyone should pay more than $75 a night. Improvements needed: carts for the maids to clean the rooms new mattresses( they sink when you sit on them) and new windows in the rooms( we were on the 6th floor and all the noise from the street was in our room). There are pluses- great location rooms are nice size new elevators that are speedy great pool and ocean view. thanx,patrat14150
UR21186542,2008-24-October,don't let this hotel fool you  i booked 10 days at $75.00 a day but what they do not tell you is the hotel staff are very rude there is no cafe most of the time i have never seen a breakfast the beach is locked and if it was not locked it is all reef no swimming. it cost $24.00 a day to park there. there is no phone in the room if you want a phone it only cost 35 dollars if you want a wake up call they come beating on your door. there is no laundry here. you have to go across the street to use a public laundry. so don't be suckered in on this dump of a hotel. and by the way the internet connection sucks too and there is no coffee,raa9876
UR14463896,2008-23-March,Don't check in! This hotel is dirty smelly and not worth your hard earned money! The beach is there but you can't use it the renovations are ongoing causing it to be very loud. You can't charge drinks to your room account but must pay separately on demand. The beds are most uncomfortable and the bathrooms leave much to be desired. We were to say the very least very very disappointed in this place. Cindy Portland ME,Downeaster2
UR21991182,2008-19-November,The hotel charges a pretty expensive rate for parking approx. 18/day. One day we came back from activities and there was no parking! They take a $100 deposit out of your credit card jujst in case you charge something to your room or brake something but goooood luck getting it back! Cannot swim at the beach and the hotel is old school and tacky looking.,dvsnats
UR20907069,2008-15-October,This hotel stay was pre-wedding for my husband and I. Believe me when I say it is NOT what we had in mind for the start of a romantic wedding and honeymoon! First and foremost this place is in the G H E T T O (In my opinion all of San Juan is pretty much a dump). Check-in was fairly simple and went quickly though the staff did not speak great english (no biggie). We got to our room and opened the door to what seemed like a sauna. The A/C in the room took quite a while (2+ hours) to get cool and the hotel itself has absolutely NO A/C in the common areas. That means a hot sticky lobby hallways lounge etc. Pretty uncomfortable. By the time we got to our room we were ready to crash - our earlier flight had been canceled and we had been chasing replacement flights from Washington D.C. since 8am (it was now after 11pm). The airlines had also misplaced our luggage so we had absolutely nothing. Wanting to get a shower before bed my husband went first. I heard a loud crash come from the bathroom and found him with the shower door (which had fallen off the tracks) on the floor. Lovely. Showering without a curtain or a door was certainly a task. The bathroom was absolutely filthy to top that off. The room itself felt so discusting that both of us put our dirty clothes from that day back on just to sleep in because we wouldn't sleep bare in the sheets! But when we finally laid down to rest the mattress fell out from underneath us and the bed frame broke. We slept with the mattress on the floor. The next morning the manager gave my husband a 50% discount on the room for the night. We won't be going back.,GimmeTradeWinds
UR14309501,2008-15-March,I was reading reviews for hotels on St Martin and remembered that I never wrote a review for when I stayed at this hotel last year before a cruise. I read a couple of reviews here and most were decent some were bad. Since it was only 1 night and there wasnt much available I figured I would take a shot. Big mistake Huge. This place is a dump. Our room was so ratty and worn down I felt like I was staying in a vagabond hotel. Except we were paying over $200 per night. I couldnt believe how terrible the hotel was. Dont stay here under any circumstances. I would rather sleep on the rocks in front of the hotel than in the rooms. By the way Who could imagine that the San Juan Beach Hotel has no beach. Pretty incredible. The entire exterior of the building is surrounded by jagged rocks. The hotel also has no balconies.,Pritchett54
UR13429049,2008-10-February,Not a great location. Beach is only for looking at high surf and lots of rocks = I saw no one in the water. One elevator broken so wait times became long. Wireless Internet access was poor. It couldn't hold my vpn for more than a few minutes. Two days without hot water. My advice is to either pay the money to be close to Old San Juan or go closer to the airport near a real beach.,dsingram
UR6920265,2007-6-March,Old Dirty Smell no room service no bar. Complete desaster for $150 a nigth.,sebaini
UR6751107,2007-6-February,Husband and I stayed at San Juan Beach hotel. We just like to enjoy our surroundings and we read all the reviews and still decided to stay. What a BIGGG mistake. The location was pretty good and the staff was extremely friendly. The place reeked with a mildew smell. It was awful just walking into our room and waking up to the smell of mildew. Luckily we didn't spend much time in our room at all. We visited the Condodo casino and resort. We should have stayed there for about $60 a night more it would have been well worth the difference in price. We had also stayed at the comfort inn post cruise. Which was nice and comfortable with coffee in the room. We will not stay at this hotel again and I suggest that you don't subject yourself to the disappointment. My husband and I had the attitude that it is just someplace to sleep but we couldn't really enjoying sleeping because of the smell. So you have been warned just as we were but do not make the same mistake we did.,Dendan
UR7239798,2007-28-March,I would not stay here again particularly for the price we paid which included a 9% 'Hotel Service Charge' above and beyond the 9% gov't tax and $5pp/night municipal fee. When we asked about the Hotel Service Charge we were told it was another tax. In that situation we figured what can we do? I took a look at the Holiday Inn Express website and their San Juan hotel right down the street (also in Condado) does not have this service fee. We took a look at the HI Express while we were in town and the pool is smaller than the SJB's but that seemed to be the only drawback. And the SJB's pool got cloudier by the day as they seemed to not be caring for it at all. We had to switch rooms after the 1st night because our TV didn't work and you couldn't adjust the temperature on the bathroom faucet. Our new room was only marginally better. And there was one day we came back to no room cleaning after being out of the room the entire day (9-5). At that point we just asked for clean towels for our shower when they offered to clean it for us then. The only food available in the hotel was a continental breakfast for a ridiculous $7+tax. The spread wasn't impressive from the looks of it and I could just grab a better breakfast from a local place for much cheaper. All in all if I went to San Juan again I would NOT stay at the San Juan Beach. I feel it was way overpriced for the service/amenities.,mgates95
UR7230459,2007-27-March,Traveling with a group of 16 to a cruise we had no choice but to honor reservations at the SJBH for a single night. My wife and I simply thought "how bad can it be?" We're hearty souls and can spend a single night most anywhere and we often seek out bargains at the expense of luxury. That said nothing prepared us for this hotel. It is unclean unkempt in desperate need of repair and overhaul and from a guest standpoint a complete disaster. There are serivce issues - we had no towels and literally chased a hotel worked to get two. There are no services in terms of food or drink and there are very limited opportunities for those within walking distance. There are cleanliness issues. The walls are peeling the carpet heavily stained most everywhere and even the bed linens felt and looked very dirty. With tax we paid more than $200 for this dump; we could have had much nicer for $100 more. Our recommendation: save the $100 somewhere else. Do not - repeat DO NOT - stay at this hotel. If you want to know "just how bad can bad be?" stay at the San Juan Beach Hotel to find out .,rmblnguy
UR7988493,2007-25-June,This hotel was the worst hotel I have ever stayed at in my life -- including cheap hostels. I booked it through Priceline as a 3-star hotel but it is not even a 1-star. Please look at my pictures to corroborate my story. When we arrived the hotel seemed nice from the outside. When we checked in we were told we were on the 4th floor but the elevator was not working. We had to schlep all of our suitcases up the stairs with no offer of help. We got to the room and were immediately disappointed but not totally disgusted. All of the fixtures were completed rusted over including the towel-holder in the bathroom (shower) where our towels (all 2 of them!) were hanging. All of the lamp shades were BURNT. My bedspread had rips and tears all over it. My travel companion pulled back her bedspread to find BLOOD STAINS on it (refer to pics). We left the hotel for the day and came back that evening to the most disgusting room ever. I walked in and noticed that the mirror was wet. I mentioned it to my friend wondering if the maid had forgotten to wipe it down after spraying it. My friend realized that it seemed to be covered in a dew. She went to pick up a travel guide from the bed and it was damp. Then I picked up a sweater I had left in the room -- it was also damp. The furniture in the room was wet (refer to pics) the bed was wet the mirror was wet all the clothing we had hung up was wet and the walls were wet (refer to pics). We look up and there is disgusting black mildew COVERING the ceiling. The air in the room was so thick and humid you could barely breathe after a few minutes. We went to the front desk who refused to refund us our money so we could change hotels and were switched to another room on the 8th floor. We get in the new room and can breathe thankfully. However there is no LOCK on the door (refer to pics)! We pull back our beds and are in for new surprises. My bed has a blanket but no top sheet. My friend's bed has a top sheet but no blanket! Also the fixtures were still rusted there was hair in the bathtub and the lampshades were burned. The drapes were covered in mildew (refer to pics). We suck it up and go to sleep knowing we will be switching to another hotel the next day no matter what. When we wake up we found hundreds of ANTS all over the dresser in the room where they had left us complimentary cookies. How do ants travel up 80 feet to the 8th floor?! Also please refer to pics to view the carpeting in the hallways. THIS HOTEL IS A HEALTH HAZARD. DO NOT STAY HERE. IF YOU HAVE BOOKED THROUGH PRICELINE CALL IMMEDIATELY AND COMPLAIN.,CheapSoda
UR7202251,2007-22-March,Thank goodness my husband and I only slept there !! The corridors smelled absolutely no towels in the room mold on lamp shades holes in linen dust all over furniture.. We insisted on another room but it was just as bad. I even went so far to pay double at Marriott  but that was booked. I am just happy that we did not bring our children. This place is in serious need of a renovation !!!!,Gonza-huert
UR8211488,2007-21-July,I have always booked my trips to Puerto Rico on Priceline and have done quite well in the past with stays at Hotel Normandie and San Juan Marriott for $99 per night. This time my $99 per night on Priceline landed me the San Juan Beach Hotel which they actually call a three star rating. After getting the hotel I looked at the reviews on this hotel and became quite concerned with all of the bad publicity it has received. I then contacted Priceline and told them that I wanted the opportunity to change hotels based on the bad reviews it had received..They emphatically said "NO" and that they felt that their rating as a fair assessment of this hotel. Since it was on my credit card I had no choice but to go. When I arrived at 7:00 pm my room was not ready. I was told to wait in the lobby of the hotel. About 30 minutes later my room was ready. I was surprised that the housekeepers were still working this late. The view from the room was incredible as I was looking right directly out from the ocean. The room itself was not very clean. The carpet was still dirty the bedspread had holes in it the lamp shades were completed burned and the bathroom had quite a bid of mold on the ceiling and the shower curtain. Twice we were not replenished with any towels. Had to go to the front desk and were informed that they were out of towels at that point and had to wait until they washed the old ones. Pool area and view from the pool were quite nice and the gentleman that works the bar was quite entertaining and did whatever he could to make your stay good while acknolwedging that the hotel had a lot of work to be done but told us that it was under new managmement and would get better soon. (that didn't do me any good) When I checked out I had things on my bill that I never paid for like Valet Car and telephone charges. They took them off my bill but had no idea how they got there. I do have to say that everyone in the hotel was extremely nice and seemed to acknowledge that the hotel has had many issues. My biggest issue is with Priceline because I feel that they deceived me in calling this a 3 star hotel. If I wanted a one star hotel and I stayed here then I would not be disappointed. I sent a note to Priceline after my stay and told them everything but they had no interest in what I had to stay and once again said that this meets their standard for a 2.5 Star Hotel (Funny that they were now calling this a 2.5 Star Hotel). Guess they rounded up to 3 instead of down to 2. In any case I blame Priceline more than the hotel because I would have never booked this hotel based on the comments from the readers. Everything that everyone says about this hotel is mostly true. You get what you pay for. My suggestion would be to do your own research and never use Priceline again!,RobSport
UR11886152,2007-21-December,Because I think it is helpful to know a reviewer's 'standards' when reading a review I will start this review by saying I am not a 'leave the light on' hotel-chain type of traveler. The 'lowest' level of hotels I normally stay in are Fairfield Inns. I had hoped the San Juan Beach hotel would be at that level - as I was staying for one night and only need a clean room and decent bed. I was disappointed. The staff is very friendly. That was the only highlight. For starters I booked the hotel in part because it was 'close to the airport'. It is actually a 10 minute ($20) cab ride away. There are many hotels much closesr to the airport. Second the lobby is the cleanest/best kept of the hotel. Beware of pics of only the lobby. It is very deceiving. The entire facility needs serious basic upgrades: 1) paint is in poor shape everywhere 2) carpets are horrid. Really horrid 3) the bathrooms are moldy 3) the rooms beat up badly 4) beds are horrid. Our flight was delayed and we arrived at 3 am. On the way to the hotel I had decided I would pay for a late checkout so I could sleep in. But frankly after I arrived I realized I wanted out of there as quick as possible. I slept in cloths and kept socks on the whole time. We left by 9 am. This hotel does not rate two stars. It needs serious clean up. It feels and looks dirty and grungy. I could not recommend this to anyone. Spend $30-$60 more a night and find something else.,prs2007
UR7193671,2007-20-March,I stayed at this hotel for one night before meeting a friend at the Carribe Hilton for the remainder of my vacation. Since I was only staying for one night I went for this relatively inexpensive choice. San Juan Beach Hotel cost a total of $185 for the one night a savings of $70 over the Carribe Hilton. Of course the difference between the two properties is light years. The Hilton is a resort while the San Juan Beach is a former Ramada property that needs a serious update. The lobby and and hallways are a bit dingy but the room was fairly clean large and quiet. I did not see any of the dirty lampshades or bedding that other reviewers have reported on. There was no visible mold although the air was stale until the air conditioning was turned on. The beach area is only for sunning as the surf is too violent and the pool is indeed not for children. The Condado area where the hotel is located is safe for walking around with good choices of local and chain eateries. Try the Ajili Mojili right across the street for lunch. It has excellent Puerto Rican food at reasonable cost and the portions are ample. The good points about the San Juan Beach Hotel are the location and the friendly and efficient desk staff.,Makeupyourmind
UR8461109,2007-20-August,This was a horrible experience. I am a travel agent and I would not reccomend this hotel to an enemy. When I arrived and recieved my room I was so disgusted. I called room service and requested a newely renovated room. Once I entered the newely renovated room I became more disgusted. I really didnt see a difference between the two rooms. I immediately got the hell out of there. This hotel should be rated as a motel with no stars. I would suggest the RADISSON AMBASSORDOR any time. The overall experience for san juan beach hotel is a lie.,svinson
UR7189384,2007-19-March,So I travel to San Juan frequently and absolutely LOVE the San Juan Beach Hotel. Not your 5-star establishment and the owners could stand to put some money into remodeling the joint but its on the beach and the folks that work there have always been so wonderful...until the other day. I woke up a little bit after 6AM to the sound of sirens and horns and whistles and some angry folks outside picketing the hotel! Then I read in the news today that the San Juan Beach hotel fired like 20 workers and replaced them with no notice or anything! I will be checking out immediatetly the noisemakers outside said they would be picketing every morning!,MichigantoSanJuan
UR8751466,2007-18-September,I stayed at the San Juan Beach Hotel from August 30th through September 4th and it was definitely an experience. One of the first things we (me my aunt and two of our friends) noticed is that there were certain things required of us that weren't stated on Expedia during the booking process. We rented a car and we weren't told until be got to the hotel that there is a $17 dollar a day charge for valet service. This really isn't bad compared to the cost of taking a taxi ride but if we were told this up front we would have at least expected it. Also during check in we were told that they needed credit cards for both rooms in case we used room service or went to the bar. Again this really isn't a problem and I understand hotels do this often (especially when you pay for your trip up front) but this information was not stated up front during the booking process. When we asked the front desk people to explain the need for the credit card numbers they weren't the friendliest. It took another worker to come to our assistance and explain in detail the need for the credit cards (which weren't charged). I have never been to Puerto Rico and as a first time tourist I had a couple of places in mind that I wanted to visit. The hotel did provide a little information about these places but they had pre packed tours they recommended that cost between $50 and $150 dollars. Luckily we heard another hotel guest complaining about her tour (which she didn't finish) and decided to look into other ativities of our own. The Bacardi tour which they priced at around $50 each only cost us about $25 dollars total. This includes the parking garage fee the fee for the ferry and the cab ride too and from the plant (which was a great experience). The hotel also had certain restaurants they recommended. The first night we went to one of the right down the road from the hotel the food was okay but if you want to impress your guest you have to do better. The second night we went to another recommended hotel which ended up being a horrible experience! Finally on the third day we decided to go on the internet (it is free for all hotel guest) and find attractions and restaurants on our own. The hotel was not the cleanist but I expected this due to reviews I read before my trip. We didn't spend much time in our room anyway so that wasn't one of my concerns. The main advise I want to share is do your own research rent a car and get directions from the internet (not the locals)! Enjoy your trip!,Ljeanine
UR8131243,2007-16-July,We booked 2 rooms for 1 night to allow us to do some sightseeing in Old San Juan before going to the Wyndham Rio Mar for the remainder of our trip. On arrival we knew we had made a mistake (thank goodness it was only for 1 night). The lobby was in disrepair and the had bed sheets hanging from the ceiling covering the entry to the closed mezzanine. The elevators were slow the hallways were damp and musty. The rooms were dated in disrepair and were also damp and musty. Mold in the bathrooms. Each room had one towel and no washcloths in the bathroom. I went to the front desk and was told that they had no washcloths in the whole hotel! Priceline had this hotel rated at 3 stars. Won't go back and won't use priceline again. Had much better luck with hotwire.,SDM08
UR8707671,2007-13-September,We had a stopover in San Juan overnight before returning home. The hotel was listed as close to the airport it is 10 minutes away. The room was bug infested the a/c did not work and the sheets on the bed were old and did not fit. We changed rooms and still were not satisfied. Plus there's lots of construction around the hotel.Cannot think of anything postive about the hotel except the price.,sunsurfandsand
UR6590159,2007-13-January,We stayed one night before catching an early flight. Only nice thing to say was that the few staff we ran into were friendly and helpful. Hotel is run down room was very spacious but worn out gave the impression of it not being really clean. The fact it was close to restaurants was a bonus. Would not stay here again.,kacyOntario
UR5764737,2006-3-September,The best things one could say about the San Juan Beach Hotel are the location and the staff. Located in Condado the hotel is within walking distance of restaurants shopping the beach and the busline which made geting to Old San Juan a breeze (a bus ride is $.75 one way). The staff at the front desk were helpful and friendly. Reviews that describe the shabbiness of the hotel are true.The first thing we noticed about our room was the musty smell. There was mold on the ceiling the bedspreads had rips the bathroom was in dire need of updating with a leaky sink poor ventilation and not enough towels and wash cloths.,iseeyouRN
UR6315143,2006-1-December,I stayed at this hotel on November 17 2006 - one night before a cruise. I was very disappointed in the accomodations. The lobby has no operating restaurant. Therefore you have to go out to get coffee in the morning. The one computer that guests can use is located in the lobby hallway to the elevators. It was not working during my stay. The rooms leave alot to be desired - especially the bathrooms. Ours had ants crawling around the sink. Not an infestation but enough to notice. We were also on an upper floor.The bathroom needed maintenance. Caulking around the sink tub etc. The bathroom sink did not drain fast. When I looked down there was massive amounts of hair. The beach this property is located on is not a beach you go in and enjoy the water. So if you are booking a hotel on a beach for the purpose of hanging out on the beach. This is probably not for you. Also the ladies bathroom on the first floor was unusable due to a urine smell. I would not stay there or recommend this hotel especially for the rate and the taxes. They should do Better.,bjrhomes
UR3559969,2005-16-June,Room was large and had a nice view. Airconditioning worked. It took a service call to be able to turn the water on in the bathtub/shower. To their credit I did not have to wait long. I also had the same problem turning the water off. The biggest problem I have was paying cash upon checkout after presenting a credit card on checkin. They put a $138.00 temp authorization on my card when my bill was only $111 (special hospital rate). I stayed the night of 6/8 and here it is 6/16 and the temp authorization has not been lifted. I called the hotel and was told by a desk clerk that their bank keeps the authorization in effect for 17 days. This to me is unacceptable. I called my bank card and the authorization manager and I have tried to contact the hotel's accounting department for two days now. Yesterday there was no answer at all and today I was only able to get a voicemail system to answer. I think this is another case of unresponsive management as mentioned in another posted review.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3458540,2005-10-May,I loved the ocean view and sound from my room. It did feel a bit damp however as I have read in other reviews. The location was wonderful  nice restaurants and bars nearby and a nice walk to better beaches. The staff was very friendly and helpful but three things were wrong: 1) the website promised a coffee machine and CD player in the room but they were not there and not provided after I mentioned it 2) the doors of all rooms are incapable of closing quietly therefore there was a lot of slamming noises at all hours and 3) there was an all night party nearby which woke me up throughout the night until 4:00 a.m. I finally had to call the person at the front desk who handled it promptly and successfully.,A TripAdvisor Member
