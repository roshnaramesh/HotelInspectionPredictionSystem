UR125772679,2012-7-March,There is a reason they have a NO REFUNDS policy! Bugs everywhere dirty rooms window panes missing no AC elevator doesn't exist that I could find I could go on and on!!! I would never recommend this place if it were free!,HeyDayDay
UR133540024,2012-5-July,We had a rather large wedding in New Orleans planned and about 15 different family members needed a inexpensive place to stay for 7-10 days. I was a late show so I didnt get to experience the "Holy Cow" moment when you walked in the door. I was forwarned. When I went to check in I noticed the stairs that were cracked the hand rail was litterally falling off its hinges and the entire front lobby had a stale smell. I checked in and was shown to the second floor. I had the better room out of the 8 that were rented by us. I didn't have dirty carpets I had an actual closet and my bathroom was relatively clean with no bugs. My family didn't get so lucky. They made an immediate stop to Walmart to purchase Raid Extra Towels Cleaning Supplies and bug traps. They put them all to use. I was terrified about sleeping by myself so I bunked with my two Aunts. Each night I made them go into the room first check for roachs and other various bugs. Can we say disgusted? There were quite a few homeless/crack head/ strange individuals staying at the orphanage. I never felt safe..at all. Delta Angel is there so called restaurant on site. Please explain how an near empty kitchen with a table cloth on a table is moving eratically entirely on its own. ROACHES...There is no grading system in New Orleans. The 6th day we were at the hotel an older family member of mine (75) noticed a leak in the ceiling. The leak turned into a down poor which turned into the entire ceiling in room 4 to come crashing down missing him by a foot. I'm not exagerating by saying all 15 of us checked out in one swoop. I didn't request a refund I didnt even care at that point. We all checked into the Hampton In at a cost of $109 per night for the remainder of our stay. The worst hotel I have ever stayed in..If you can even call it that.,kimrleon843
UR139027848,2012-31-August,Mel the girl at the front desk is psychotic and rude. The two girls at the front desk are very rude Brandi is the other girl I think but Mel was cold from the door and threw the entire stay. we saw her cleaning at one point and she was cursing the whole time. Everytime we spoke to her to say hi she always cut her eyes and gave us dirty loooks. its like a half way house a bunch of homeless people or squaters stay there for free . they trade housekeeping/maintaince (which is joke by the way) but they work in trade for the room. so i guess thats the last resort before they end up on the street. ITS DISGUSTING! dont bring your bathing suit! DO NOT LEAVE YOUR VALUABLES IN THE ROOM!!!! The place needs a new owner and REAL employess...it has hope and potential but the owner and staff have let it become a cold nasty  flop house. Id rather sleep in my car! for real im not kidding! every bad review on this site is sooooooooo true! PLEASE BE ADVISED AND TAKE THESE WARNINGS SERIOUSLY!!!!!!,Nathan B
UR122491142,2012-3-January,Our Group was called two weeks before arrival and told our rooms and reservations were canceled - after being pre-paid and pre-booked months ahead of timeMany heated phone calls later somehow we were reserved AGAIN. Too bad we insisted and checked in. I have been around the world 3 times and never seen filth like this Sticky vomit? - stained carpets Broken bed Ceiling dripping god knows what onto the bed. Dirty sheets and a smell like old warm cat urine ... Unbelievably the windows were painted shut and the 2 closest fire escapes were chained and padlocked shut!!!!! Broken - rotten rails on the second floor about 25 feet above pavement And room doors that opened onto dangerously rotten second floor decks With no marking or warning to stay off seems like a bad accident waiting to happen Avoid this filthy Dangerous dump at all cost!!!!!,Light F
UR123673144,2012-26-January,I booked a room at St. Vincent's under the agreement that I would be getting a COMPLETE pet deposit refund back in the amount of $100 if the room sustained no damage from the pet which it didn't. Before I booked I was told in an email by one of the (thieving) owners Dianne that this was their pet policy. This was confirmed again via telephone with the other owner Peter before I checked in. I thought "great everyone is on the same page." WRONG. So I checked in and checked out under the same premise that I would be fully reimbursed $100 and my receipt also reflected that my deposit of $100 was FULLY refundable. Since I put the pet deposit on my credit card I had to wait a bit for the refund to process and reflect in my bank account after I checked out. So two weeks later I find out that only $70 was put back into my account not the full $100. Now wait a second this wasn't the quote previously agreed upon (by both owners!!). When I called the heistel I mean hostel (multiple times mind you) to find out what was going on I was met with a lot of employees who didn't know what was going on with the situation. The incompetent staff took down messages for me but I was never called back. Some days I would call and no one would pick up at all. After a week of this I finally got a hold of the manager Brandy. She told me that it wasn't the owners job to do the bookings in the first place and that they misquoted me (not my problem!!). She also said that I was lucky to get $70 back! As if they have screwed other people over in the past for the full $100! She said that she talked to the owners and they said that this "was a closed case" and that there is nothing she could do about it. She apologized and said that "every hotel has a non-refundable pet deposit". BLANTANT THIEVERY! I was also never given Dianne's or Peter's phone number like I asked. I also emailed Dianne and Peter at the contact address listed on their website but never got a response. You would think that the owners (DIANNE AND PETER) would at least own up to their screw-up and compensate me for the remaining money of the deposit but no. I will never stay here again and I will make sure my friends don't either. BOTTOM LINE: NO ACCOUNTABILITY AND NO TRANSPARENCY ON THE OWNER'S PART. INCOMPETENT STAFF AND WORSE OWNERS WHO DON'T MIND RIPPING PEOPLE OFF. AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS!!! THE PLACE WAS SUPER NOISY ON TOP OF IT. THIS PLACE SUCKS. Just to add here is the initial email thread when I first booked the room: reservation st vincent email x tim Cone 12/1/11 to stvreservations Hi! I was wondering if I could make a reservation from Wednesday January 4th - Saturday January 7th. I am looking for a private room with two beds. There will be 3 people and one small dog. Please let me know if this would work when you get a chance! Thanks! Dianne Anderson stvreservations@gmail.com 12/2/11 to me Hi Tim we do have availability and the rate is $49 Wednesday and Thursday and $59 on Friday and Saturday. We accept pets with a $100 deposit that is fully refundable at the end of your stay. Just phone or e-mail to reserve. We request a one night deposit to guarantee the reservation. Cancellation is 72 hours. Cheers Dianne,Tim C
UR126565359,2012-23-March,we booked a stay thru our travel agent with a 7 day cancel policy on our amex card. We cancelled 12 days prior but it's been 30 days now and even after several calls to them by our travel agent "we'll look into it" - no deposit refund. I just disputed the charge with amex but the initial response from amex was they couldn't help because the initial deposit charge was more than 60 days ago - we are very good amex customers and when a supervisor was contacted they agreed to dispute the charge. Not getting a deposit refund has never happened to us in 30 years of traveling  I think St Vincents knows credit card companies are reluctant to dispute and are ripping people off - beware.,trevor-wa
UR125044550,2012-22-February,I stayed here for 3 nights with my boyfriend as we were attending Mardi Gras. First a couple of good points: The location is fantastic! We watched the parades from St Charles Avenue had dinner at Voodoo BBQ (near by) and it has a great coffee shop across the road (Mojos). It was also within walking distance to Canal St (half hour max on a busy night) and Bourbon St (40 minutes max). Now to the bad: Check in staff are average at best. Be sure to keep all receipts of what you have paid. The rooms are a basic 1* hotel quality the bathrooms were a shower (with curtain) and toilet (which flushed ok sometimes) and the hand basin was in the room. The floors were not spotless the rooms were cold (although there was a smal bar heater in the room) and overall I would not ever stay here again. The price for Mardi Gras week/weekend was good value for the location and if you can tolerate no housekeeping for your stay and basic rooms then this is your place. There is no room safe and the door lock was somewhat dodgy. The room walls are paperthin and it is very noisy at night time with people outside in the courtyard area. If you want a nice warm shower with a nice hotel room to relax in this is NOT your place. If you want somewhere that is in a good spot don't care about cleanliness and just want a bed to rest this could be your place. Overall this is probably the worst place I have stayed in in my 30 years however it served its purpose.,waterskier82
UR139159152,2012-2-September,My husband and I are were just staying one night in New aorleans before our cruise left the next day so we thought we would get a basic hotel room and booked at St. Vincent Guest House on Magazine st. In NOLA . . . . It said a "non-smoking room king size bed ac and free breakfast" we aren't snobs or rich by any means so we booked it. When we got there Hurricane Isaac had just blown through so there was no power hence no AC that wouldn't have been an issue if you could open a window . . . But you can't. It also has what seems like permanent guests there so you don't feel comfortable leaving your things in your room or opening the door to let fresh air in. Also the bed was a FULL at best . . . . No where near a King super low to the ground and I would not put my skin on those stained sheets even if I weren't 5months pregnant! The room was relatively clean and so was the bathroom but there is a nice low window that comes down to about your waist while you sit on the toilet and look out onto . . . . The walkway . . . They have a no refund policy . . . For good reason we checked in to our room walked down to Canal st. booked a different room and checked out within 2 hours and they took our $60 dollars. The house is really an historical landmark and shouldn't be used as an hotel or hostel. They had a certificate at the front desk that said they had passed a bedbugs inspection but like I said we didn't stay to find out if it was true or not . . . THIS IS NOT THE PLACE FOR YOU IF YOU WANT TO ENJOY YOUR HOTEL STAY. Stay here if you want a youth hostel or a place to live for a while on the cheap. Also the guy at the front desk was very polite so we did not have an issue with the staff just the false advertising and crappy conditions .,amojoudy
UR122435992,2012-2-January,Ive never seen an accommodation like this!!! The first impression was: It smells weed!!! Reception personal was HIGH!!!! First room they gave us was already occupied... We went back they gave us another room. We entered the new room: smoke detector made noise the bath was oily and dirty behind the door hung a totally dirty towel with a lot of holes and the bed was completely dirty with hair and oil spots. Also back to the front desk. After 20 minutes they gave us another room the third what was stinky dirty and not a private room like we booked: it had 2 bunk beds. So we put two matresses together in the floor and couldnt sleep afraid of insects. To top it of the lights couldnt turn off. Instead of they were blinking like in a night club but actually it was a nightmare. We asked for a cancellation for the next day but they told us that only the main manager could do this and she would be back on the next day from 7:30am till 1:30pm... Next day: no manager at the front desk and no help with cancelation refund or even to find another room. We decided to stay because we had no other possibility because all others hotels were sold out.,Dennis S
UR134109130,2012-11-July,As they say you get what you pay for. The pictures from the website are very misleading because the bedroom I got did not look half as good as the ones on the website. The room was run down burnt and torn curtains comforter looked like it was at least 10 years old. The carpet was old the waste basket sat in a hole in carpet. The ensuite bathroom was not much better. The cleanliest thing in the whole room was the toilet. I had a nice surprise of roaches in the bathroom when I went to use it at night. I should have known when I say the can of Raid on top of the closet. Was supposed to stay there 2 nights but after the first I stayed out the whole next night to avoid sleeping there. The staff is friendly but as far as my room which was room 30 I would never stay here again.,NicMor6680
UR103425778,2011-9-April,We booked more than a week ago and St Vincent's Guesthouse charged our creditcard. However when we arrived they told us there was no reservation because of a problem with online booking sites. Unfortunately there was nowhere else to stay. We made a reservation for a private room but eventually we were forced to agree to stay in a dorm room. The dorm room was filled with people who experienced the same treatment. Some were told there was a plumbing problem and others that there was a problem with the online booking. When we left the in the morning we told the staff that the dorm room was dirty and that everbody in de dormroom was tolt different lies. But they don't seem to bother. New Orleans is a great town but this place is a great disappointment. We will never ever go here again.,nonche1
UR112125500,2011-8-June,when approaching the building it looks absolutely magnificent and when you enter you still feel the same but unfortunately when you enter the dorm you feel very dissapointed. the 20 bed dorm was pretty disgusting and was obviously not cared for. the bathroom had enough pubic hair to make a bald man very happy.... the main problem witht his hostel is the occupants. most of them are obviously long stays and many have differents issues with things like mental health alcohol addiction and other social needs. although none of them made me feel threatened their behaviour could be intimidating when you returned back to the hostel. Dont get me wrong everyone was friendly but it is maybe not appropriate to have people who are basically living there and people who are on holiday stay all together. It made it very difficult to complain as some of them work on front desk and you don't want to cause any offence. when discussing the dorms i was told that it is too difficult to clean them when people leave their stuff everywhere. However the hostel was making some positive changes and were making a consciencous effort to make it more inviting to travellers. while i was there they were doing some building work etc. they have a swimming pool but i am not sure how well maintained it was. i was also told by other guests that the private rooms were lovely and very clean. unfortunately i did have a horrible experience with bedbugs but in defence America is having an issue but if the dorm isnt cleaned hoovered etc then the problem will only get worse. the actual hostel is based in the lower garden district which is actually very nice. it is a far walk into the french quarter if you are expecting to stay close to town. it takes about 25 mins to walk otherwise there is a tram that takes you all the way in and it only cost $1.25. i actually felt quite safe in this area as new orleans is well known to have areas you shouldnt walk alone in. overall if you wanted an over stay if you can cope with bedbugs or were planning to have a private room; here would be fine. honestly i wouldnt recommend single females to stay here and i wouldnt recommend it. but if they made changes i think it could be a really nice place to stay....,sibbers83
UR121518105,2011-8-December,A firend and I made reservations on Sunday 12/4/11 and both cancelled them after reading reviews posted on this site on 12/05/11. We were both charged $70.26 for cancelling our reservation well before the 1/05/12 deadline.,Keaton S
UR121505437,2011-7-December,I checked in with wife into a private room for VACATION...we literally slept with one eye open and felt like we has creepy crawlies all night long...I stepped on a roach while walking to the bathroom on the carpet that looked it was covered in vomit. the bed was sagging and terrible and the bed cover was full of cigarette holes and burn marks. The people cleaning are definitely on crack and all they do is pour bleach all over but you can't really get that place clean. I was supposed to stay 5 nights but left after one for this great b&b around the corner. i definitely paid more but at least I came out a live and bedbug free. The place is nasty its that simple. if you like nasty it's the place for you - or if you're homeless. The biggest shame is that the place CAN be nice if they put in a little bit of money. It's huge and has great form but it's right now a rundown sh**hole. It will ruin your trip if you stay there take it from someone who was just there this past weekend. I wish i would have done my research.,Chris P
UR115065099,2011-5-July,I think the title sais what I need you to know first night and i woke up in the middle of the night with those things on the bed 2 days later my girlfriend had all these bites around her back and one of her arms.,AleFuentes
UR110624678,2011-30-May,The good: This hostel has a saltwater pool - such a blessing when New Orleans is so so hot - this if anything totally redeemed the hostel for us as my friends and I spent a lot of time in here! The staff were also very very friendly helpful and laid back (although one guy did make a little mistake with our deposit but then he took some money off). They offered us towels and toiletries as well as bedding and allowed my friend to store his guitar in the office for our stay. There was also free wifi which was very high speed! The common space is the building and the general historical architecture was also rather pleasing - there were a lot of plush sofas and a huge dayroom as well as picnic tables outside in the garden/pool area. The restaurant was also a very good stop for breakfast - $3 got you a egg sausage and cheese biscuit. Location wise - the number 11 bus stops right outside the cable car is a couple of blocks away and even walking it's only about 20 minutes to the French Quarter. So now the bad: So we stayed here for 3 nights last week in a 22 bed dorm. We were prepared for staying in a big dorm but we assumed that whilst it would be big the dorm would also be spacious (we all had big backpacks). This wasn't the case - the room was jammed to the full with beds with the 'aisles' in between so small only one person could get through at a time. My mattress was also rather uncomfortable - I felt like I was sleeping on planks although most in the room were fine. There were also no security codes/keys on the doors (one which led directly outside) which meant we had no choice but to store all our valuables in a locker. There were two bathrooms attached which were a bit on the dirty and run down side with a few bugs and the showers were small. Unfortunately our air conditioning broke while we were here - but the staff did fix this eventually and were good about keeping us updated on the situation. The hostel also had a bit of the feel of a 'halfway house' with a few long term residents - one guy came up to us and just started rattling of his DUIs told us he was going into rehab and then asked for one of our half drunk beers! But for the most the other guests were friendly and not scary - although just about half the crowd was over 30. It wouldn't be hard for this hostel to improve - just remove a few bunk beds from the dorms in the less busy guest periods to make them more comfortable for everyone and spruce up the bathrooms a bit. Also maybe cut down on the length of stay people are allowed. The general building is a beautiful historical building and could be a really nice place to stay if a few little changes were made. I'm choosing not to recommend this to others - purely on the basis I wouldn't want to stay here alone - however if you are with friends and want somewhere cheap (but with a pool!) - it's fine.,RachelBL
UR102167022,2011-30-March,The staff was as helpful and courteous as they could be but the conditions of this place were pretty bad. I tried to over look the roaches I tried to overlook the dirt and dilapidated conditions because after all it is over 100 years old. But what I could not get past was the lack of air conditioning. It was averaging 75-80 degrees during our stay and the college group that I was with stayed in the dorms. For what we were charged I found a decent local motel with clean rooms plenty of towels ample a/c no bugs and saved $20 per room. I do want to say that the location of St. Vincent's was convenient to walk to Bourbon St. about a mile away. But I would rather pay more money for a hotel/motel closer with A/C and no humongous roaches.,misternas
UR106686947,2011-3-May,My wife and I are adventurous travelers always looking for a good deal. My wife booked St. Vincent's for our weekend in New Orleans. First mistake is we arrived late tired and hungry....three keys to making a bad decision. We stayed one night and checked out the next morning assured we would not be charged for our booked nights but of course our bank statement shows they charged us for all 4 nights. I finally got credited for 2 nights but still payed for a something less than satisfactory and something that we did not even use. BTW it took us about two weeks of calling to get a call back for the partial refund. The place was very dingy and dirty but we thought we would take a look at the room. It was as bad. Reluctantly we decided to stay for fear we would have trouble finding a place to stay at 11pm. The bathroom was dirty and the bed had pubic hair in it and the sheets were dirty. The floors were musty and not vacuumed. The place sells itself as a non party atmosphere which compared to Bourbon street may be true but we had loud partying above us all night. All I can say is spend the extra money and don't bite this hook. Also they are a long ways from the attractions. At least 1.5 miles through not so safe neighborhoods. Having this place as a home base would mean lots of cash spent on taxi's or more time walking than listening to good music. I would try VRBO.com...we ultimately found something 10 times nicer for just about $20 more per night and we were only two blocks from frenchmans street and lots of music.,daufuskielocal
UR115878327,2011-28-July,DO NOT STAY AT ST VINCENT'S GUESTHOUSE AVOID AT ALL COSTS. We booked over the phone and were told our stay would cost us $60 for 3 nights which we thought was such a good deal that we could not resist. HOW WE REGRET THIS! Upon arrival we discovered that our stay would in fact be $180 instead of just $60. Our room was boiling hot and smelt terrible. We were so hot we could barely sleep. Then I woke up covered in bed bug bites such serious bites in fact that I ended up having to visit an emergency doctor and get an injection to prevent me from getting even more ill. We reported this to the receptionist she was unapologetic and impolite. We left after 1 night and instead of writing the real reason for our departure bed bugs on our request for a refund she wrote 'family emergency' when she knew full well that this was not the case resulting in us not receiving the full refund that we deserved. This experience ruined our time in New Orleans and I would not wish it upon anyone. Avoid the St Vincents Guesthouse at all costs!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,shawshankredeemer
UR101554932,2011-25-March,We booked online one week earlier called ahead and they said everything was fine. However when we arrived at the hotel nothing was done: no reservation no room. I guess they give us the worst rooms they have in that guest house. Stains on the sheets on the walls. The ceiling is falling off and is full of holes. Moreover there was no window in my room! I'd not even bring a hooker back in that room! I'm pretty sure hey have a couple of nice rooms but some of them are nasty and it stinks bad in there.,WoopWoopy
UR109703066,2011-24-May,I woke up covered in bed bug bites after a one night stay in my unsanitary private room. That should be all you need to know. If bed bugs come home with you in your luggage it is very difficult and costly to get rid of them. This establishment should be closed down for negligence.,d-rock7
UR117089511,2011-22-August,I stayed here with a group of law students on Spring Break from Chicago doing volunteer work in the Lower 9th Ward. We were arriving the weekend after Mardi Gras and so accomodations were hard to find for a group. We settled on St. Vincent's Guest House and we actually stayed in one of the manager's private quarters on the first floor. During and after Mardi Gras when demand is high apparently the manager moves all his furniture out and sets up bunk beds in what is essentially a one bedroom apartment. There is a fan in the bedroom but the window doesn't open. Can't speak to the state of the other regular hostel rooms as we didn't see them. There were 12 of us crammed into that space. I had never stayed in a hostel before and after St. Vincent's I probably won't again. The place just didn't look or feel clean. We did receive fresh linens when we checked in though some us opted to bring our own. The weather the week we were there would have been warm enough to go in the pool but it looked slimy. Some of the people working at St. Vincent's are also quite questionable. I tried to stay out of the room as much as possible so in the mornings and evenings before and after volunteering I would sit out at the table out front by the fountain and was approached a few times by people that worked at St. Vincent's who were clearly under the influence of something during work hours. Strange. Convenient that there is a coffee shop across the street. Decent area within walking distance of the Street Car or a short cab ride to the French Quarter. You can tell the property used to be a grand old place. It just needs to be thoroughly scrubbed down and aired out.,scarlet99
UR117036717,2011-21-August,We were traveling to NOLA to attend a big education conference so made a reservation by email then called and left a credit card deposit to make sure we had a room. But when we arrived the person at the front desk was rude denied we had a reservation and said there were no available single rooms due to plumbing trouble; they showed us a dorm room they said we could stay in which was awful hot packed with sleeping people. Essentially this place is an SRO. While we were in the lobby calling hotels to see if we could find a room elsewhere several other guests who said they had confirmations including a poor European couple were also turned away. As we waited for these folks to finish trying to get a room we noticed a folder with our names and a copy of our credit card receipt sitting on the front desk. Only when we pointed that out to the desk person did she admit that there was in fact a single room available. At that point we were desperate so we took the room but the whole experience was awful. I'm still not sure if they were lying all along and waiting for a bribe or something to get our room which we had already paid for one night in "released" to us or if something else was going on. Creepy. Save yourself some grief and avoid this place.,Baffling_Experience
UR100894739,2011-20-March,Good Service People at the reception desk are very nice and they will do whatever it takes to help you. Very Bad Product I booked 2 rooms ( 1 twin beds and 1 double bed ) and they were very dirty... Ceilings had plenty of stains and holes electricity cables were coming outside of the plugs sheets had holes and stains as well bathroom door did not close... If you're just looking for a bed to crash into then it is not that bad but i would say the rooms are way not worth the price.,AcidDC
UR98675035,2011-2-March,I reserved a double room in the hotel portion of St. Vincents 2 months in advance. Upon arrival I was charged for the entire 4 nights immediately. When I was shown to the room I discovered there was NO HEAT. The room is clearly advertised as having heat on their website. Since the overnight temperature was expected to be in the low 30s and the comforter was nothing more than a thin blanket and I was running in the New Orleans marathon that weekend I decided to checkout. The front desk lady offered me the space heater from her own room on my way out but it was ridiculously small for a 14 foot high ceiling and tile floor room. Since my checkout the manager and owner have refused to refund my payment even though I was in the room for less than 30 minutes. I realize its not often you need heat in the South but if they will false advertise about this what else? Dont take the chance. PS the air conditioner unit looked extremely questionable.,jeannineDallas_TX
UR102492098,2011-2-April,I am not usually one to bash a hostel/hotel online. But in this case I feel it necessary to warn. I am yet another victim of bedbugs after staying at this hostel. The room we stayed in was relatively unclean but for the price I could deal with it. The problem is I have since discovered I have bedbug bites and am currently taking proactive measures to ensure they have not followed me home. We checked the mattresses for bedbugs before settling in and found no signs of them.... but I am now covered in itchy bedbug bites.,Questathon
UR116963477,2011-19-August,We wanted a place to stay in New Orleans withing walking distance to the downtown area that would not break our bank account. We checked into this guest house around 9pm in the evening in a makeshift parking lot. The check-in process was fine since we were charged in advance. Our room was a decent size and we had a nice view of the parking lot. The pillows were very small and the bed was very uncomfortable. The carpet was threadbare and my wife came across a pubic hair from a previous guest. The internet did not work in the room and you had to go into the hallway or downstairs. This place needs to consider completing some serious renovations even for $50 per night plus tax. A major plus is that you can walk downtown in 20 minutes or take a free shuttle during the day. We chose to get some exercise and walk.,stones80123
UR118194887,2011-16-September,The people were great but the accomodations left a lot to be desired. Beds were a little lumpy tv did not receive well. But once again the area was charming and we liked the people. This building is an old children's orphanage with a lot of history behind it. The large great room was friendly and inviting and the grounds were pretty nice.,felinefrenz
UR120627312,2011-15-November,This place is incompetently managed and they make no effort to insure the safety of their guests or their guests' property. There was someone who went into the dorm while I was sleeping late Saturday night/ early Sunday morning and stole my backpack wallet money etc. The thief HAD A KEY to the dorm. When I went to the front desk to report it the manager (Brandy) asked me if I was drunk. I informed her that someone using a key had stolen my things and then I went to speak to a police officer. While I was speaking to the officer the manager put somebody else on the front desk and then left the property. After I spoke to the police and prepared to go to work I told the girl at the front desk that they needed to change the lock. I returned that evening and found they never did. Late last night someone else had their backpack stolen from the same dorm. Not only did they not change the lock but they turned right around and rented a bunk in the same dorm to another patron. He awoke this morning to find that his backpack had been stolen. I suppose they haven't considered that one of these days someone might catch the thief in the act and get injured or killed in the process. They could avoid all of these problems by keeping track of the keys but apparently that's a little too much like work for them. Simply charging a key deposit would ensure that more keys are returned. At this point I can't even be sure that it wasn't an employee.who's doing the stealing.But since this morning marked the third time in a month that this has happened they have NO excuse. This is not an isolated incident. If you value your safety and property don't stay here. These people are negligent incompetent and the manager is very rude.,SaintVictim
UR113055802,2011-13-June,This place should be condemned! The rooms are dirty the staff are rude the place is falling apart and it's full of crackheads!,blntklly
UR103490182,2011-10-April,We had a reservation for double rooms but on the day of arrival no rooms were available. It was French Quarter festival and we had a hard time to find another place. They offered dorms instead which were awful. Very dirty and smelly.,Jokneip
UR102466875,2011-1-April,I made reservations for this place during Mardi Gras 2011...they took my debit card information and was told to check in before midnight...when me and my friends showed up for our room at 5pm we were told there were no reservations for us...so we had to end up staying somewhere else...two days later my credit card was debited for $156.00 dollars but we had "no reservations"....how does that happen....I have called this place several times to resolve this matter and to no avail no response no return phone calls. I will be calling the BBB to see if I can recover my money that was debited from my account. I am very dissatisfied and frustrated with my call being ignored by the St Vincent Guest House Manager/Owner. I was told by Sharon (accountant) that the owner who's name is Peter does not return phone calls and will not speak to anyone for any reason....REALLY???,luverofpurple
UR63587417,2010-8-May,I stayed in this hostel because there were no other hotels available due to the Jazz fest. Upon arrival I was very tired of flying 20 hours the airline loosing my luggage and the high humidity but the desk clerk still thought it was a good moment to joke around with everyone else as well as me before helping me which was very annoying. I had a private room which was pretty big. It was not the cleanest I have ever seen (floor was sticky dust in corners etc there was a plant growing all the way into the bathroom from the outside) but the sheets and towels were clean. Other than in some reviews my door locked properly and I did not feel unsafe. I had free wifi although I had to move to the outside porch for good reception. The pool however was totally unusable as it was one big slimy pool of algae. Also their website mentions free airport pickup but there was no such thing. Some of my friends also booked in this hostel and they were very unhappy as they also prebooked private rooms but ended up in a dorm anyway which was very dirty with lousy beds. There was no restaurant inhouse when I was there but there is a very nice coffeehouse across the street that has everything from coffee to homemade lemonade and great subs (as well as airconditioning and free wifi). The location is actually pretty good I was a bit afraid arriving on my own in the dark but the next morning I discovered the neighbourhood is actually quite nice(although there sure is some dilapidation going around) with a lot of characeristic Garden District houses and quirky shops. You are also close to Charles Street with it's historic street car. Both this and the Magazine street bus take you to the French quarter easily. All in all not as bad as I feared when I read the reviews but I am not planning on going back any time soon. After the Jazz fest I stayed at a French quarter hotel which was hardly more expensive but a lot cleaner.,NausicaaNL
UR78635564,2010-7-September,Absolutely the worst hotel in all of New Orleans. I made reservations to stay there but canceled later on due to finding closer accommodations to the attractions. My cancellation was well within the cancellation policy set forth by the hotel and the owner still will not refund my money. He will not even return a call or even answer my phone call. Manager claims that he is always out or busy. What a ripoff. DO NOT STAY HERE you'd get better service at a Motel 6.,jaybutta3k
UR63250223,2010-4-May,I was eaten alive by bed bugs on the first night we stayed there completely covered in bites on both arms and torso. The owner tried to blame me saying I had brought them into the property which was complete nonsense. Harrison on front desk was very helpful though and arranged a new room & helped organise a free nights accomodation. That said I really cant recommend this place to anyone. It is falling to pieces & the owner needs to spend some money on it. I heard so many people complaining to the poor staff on front desk (e.g. broken showers no water ceiling falling down in one room etc). The Garden District is a lovely area but try and find another hotel in it. Avoid this place.,Chris_Griff
UR59883661,2010-29-March,A group of 7 of us from Memphis stayed at St. Vincent's this weekend while attending a local scooter rally. St. Vincent's ad states: "Our friendly staff will go the extra mile to ensure that your stay is comfortable and enjoyable." They also claim to have cable TV and phone in all the hotel rooms. Nothing could be further from the truth. Upon arrival we were all shocked at the state of disrepair of the house. Walls were dirty with cracked paint furniture in the halls and on the porches was broken the pool looked like a cesspool. We checked into our room and found no TV no phone torn curtains a broken fridge no clock not even a garbage can. The mattresses looked at felt at least 40 years old! There were no towels but we figured that getting towels would at least be a fairly simple task. We went to the front desk and Eric told us that there were no towels to be had... they had all been locked up in the housekeeping closet and that only housekeeping had keys to that closet. I was able to share a towel from a friend's room but anticipated getting fresh towels the next day. Our bed sheets didn't look very clean (at best they were worn and old) but we figured we'd get clean sheets the next day after the maid serviced our room. Later the next day when coming back to the hotel from a full day around NOLA we found that our room had not been cleaned by housekeeping. We mentioned this to Eric and he said we had an attitude that he did not appreciate. He said they do not make up the rooms on a daily basis and this should have been explained to us upon check in. He was able to find us some ratty towels but of course fresh sheets could not be found anywhere! I could go on with more but you get the idea. To sum up this place had all the charm of a 1950's mental asylum from a grade B horror film and all the customer service you would expect in a high security prison. Do not under any circumstances stay at this house. You will regret it and it will ruin your stay in NOLA.,Neuroslicer
UR88114487,2010-24-November,I have travelled quite a lot and in many places in camping areas and hostels but I would not recommend this place to anybody... It might be a personal and isolated bad experience but I don't think so... The hostel is ina good position and the ancient and colonial building is really fascinating but the staff of the place is unreliable and the rooms very dirty. To give you an idea of our experience: I had reserved well in advance for me and other friends but my room was assigned to somebodyelse the morning of our arrival and they hadn't even realized it since they gave us the keys and we entered in somebodyelse's room with all his/her stuff there... so at the end we were assigned another room that was almost a cave very humid dirty without air condition and with all sort of animals all around. They assured us that we would have been placed in another and convenient room the day after but when we asked the following day about such change the same woman answered in a very rude way saying that they were overbooked and that it was only our problem. When we asked for at least some cleaning of the room the staff member sent to clean the room - ironically - came just with a piece of toilet paper in order to pretend to take from the ground some of the cigarettes insects hair and other trash from the previous occupants of the room that covered the floor. Some of our friends had other bad experiences having a room crawl with fleas which bited them during the night. In addition we decided to leave one day earlier and asked the doorman if this was possible - despite the standard non-refund policy - to get the money back for that nigh and he said "of course we are overbooked so it's a deal for both of us. We will refund you in 2 days". When we wrote some weeks later having received no money back they denied everything.,Noluogo82
UR54219266,2010-24-January,If I can post my pictures from stay there....YOU WILL KNOW WHAT I AM TALKING ABOUT!!! We went there for the Essence Festival....like most not knowing about this spot. First when we got there...no one was at the front desk. When she came out she was sweaty....but nice! It was HOT! We got there around 1:30 am. This spot looks ok at night from the outside...you can tell it is old...which is ok. Once we finally get to our room. They had twin beds that were total different from each other...cool ok. Look around the spot....Nets flying around...ok. Jr comes out to greet us. The biggest roach I have ever seen. No phone No TV No Wireless Internet 2 Towels and 2 Wash Cloth. It started to feel like the Bates Motel....All we could do was laugh. I did not want to set my stuff on the floor. We asked for another room...She said you will like this room...it is one of our best room. Okay.....it took us about 15 mins to get there. You can't use the elevator. It was a scary site...The halls was long....she showed us the pool...She said the pool is open 24 hours....This outdoor pool looked more scary then the room....okay. Once we finally made it to the other room. It had a TV no phone 1 towel and 1 wash cloth. We pull back the the blanket on the bed..........do you really want to know? It had spots of blood and hair.....I was done...Keep the money! I spent over an hour trying to find another hotel......I called one hotel and explain to the the lady what I was going thru. They did not have any rooms but SHE said she would call around for me and call me back. Guess what.....she called back in 20 mins and had a room setup at the W. The people down there was nice! I have pictures to prove everything I said. PLEASE PAY THE EXTRA MONEY FOR A GOOD HOTEL...NOT THE BATES MOTEL!!!! No disrespect to the owners of the Hotel but you have to do better. This hotel did house Katrina people. After Katrina this hotel was still there...My hats off for helping your people.,Dalinko
UR84309728,2010-21-October,We stayed at the St Vincent Guesthouse in late August and were completely disappointed in the place. The room was basic which generally isn't a problem for me - but there was bug powder around the entire room and we were bitten by some kind of insects during the nights. The breaking point came when we found a cockroach in our luggage. We were on a two month road trip around the US staying in some pretty basic places and camping where necessary. I would say that this guesthouse gave us our WORST accommodation of the whole trip. I noticed that the General Manager has commented a previous complaint by saying that they've had no guest complaints about bug infestations for a month prior to September 15th. This is a lie. We moved out after strongly complaining about our cockroach experiences on the 20th August. He know this because we asked for a refund which - despite the staff assuring us we would be forthcoming - has not materialised yet. In fact he lied to us on multiple occasions about calling us back to discuss the matter further. My advice to anyone planning on a stay is: don't there are way nicer places to stay for a similar amount of money in NOLA. It might just ruin your experience of the whole place. The one saving grace were the staff on the front desk who tried to be as accommodating as they could be given the circumstances...,LondonBarbd
UR64853439,2010-20-May,I am a no or low-frills gal but this place was unacceptable. I seriously question how this place continues to attract clients as it is indeed the worst hospitality establishment I visited anywhere in the world--worse than any place I stayed in the U.S. Mexico or Europe. Period. I organized my review into key points so you can go with whichever topic is most important to you. Making reservations: The hotel representative who took my reservation over the phone was the surliest rudest hotel rep I have ever encountered even worse than the one years ago who wouldn't rent a hotel room because he though we were Mexican. I should have known then that this would be a bad place but I just thought it must have been a one-off person or a bad day for that person. The rep made sure to tell me that they were going to charge my credit card right then whether or not I showed up that evening. : / Price: It was something like $100/night which is inexpensive relative to other places. It was not worth ten dollars however and I would definitely spend the extra money for a better place if I was you. Location: The location was great and is the only reason to stay at this place. You are close to the bus stop but the bus was over 25 minutes late no joke. We just walked the additional blocks to the street car instead and took it around town. At least the place is located in a fun neighborhood with lots of shops and people walking around and hanging out. Room: Unacceptable. Just unacceptable. And I am one of those people who stayed in hostels lived on a mountain and worked on camp grounds and am not a wuss. Trust me. The room was bad people. This is how stingy the room was: You know how no and low frills places just provide two little soaps and one tiny bottle each of cheap shampoo conditioner and maybe lotion? Ok this place had one of those little soaps and that's it. The tv did not have a remote. Oh it wasn't the remote-chained-to-the-tv which I've seen or the one that you have to check out from the front desk which I've also done but just completely absent. The bathroom had one roll of toilet paper. Frankly I'm surprised they even gave us a towel. The bed was broken and at a steep angle on one corner but you couldn't see it until you sat on it. The sheet had a cigarette burn hole in it. Just unbelievable. Forget about in-room coffee machine or telephone. The wifi didn't work in the room at all which really irritated me because I specifically asked if they had wifi. I still had to work and respond to client emails while on the trip. I had to sit right next to the desk on the first floor to get enough of a signal just to get the most basic online work finished. Parking: There was a parking lot beside the building. No charge for parking. I wouldn't trust my car to be safe here though so I took absolutely everything out of it. There were people just hanging out watching me do it so I felt doubly paranoid about someone breaking into the car. Great Room: This room epitomizes the character of this place. All of the furniture is antique but it is utterly shabby neglected stained ripped torn antique not hip on a budget dinged but lovingly refurbished antique. There are very few outlets as the place has not been updated outside of an ugly coat of paint. The room supposedly has the wifi signal but I did not find that to be the case *anywhere in the room.* This place is just bad guys. I never would recommend this place to a friend nor would I ever return to this place.,goodtripsarebest
UR57525614,2010-2-March,This is by far the worst place I have EVER stayed in. Mr. Peter (the owner) is the most unprofessional business owner I have ever met. And the staff is not too far behind. All he cares about is money money money and more money. He has no idea what the conditions are like in any of the rooms. And I dont think he ever walks beyond the front desk and into the actual hotel to see what kind of condition he expects people to live in. I even heard himself say that he "would never let any of his family ever stay at this place because god only knows what would happen to them." No joke. The place is filthy with stains on the bed clothes and that carpeting. The pool is green and dirty to the point where I feel dirty just looking at it. It looks like all of the maintenance is done by 10 year olds. I would never come back to a hideous place like this ever again And i constantly warn people from now on when i hear of them going to New Orleans not to stay at this place.,gravytrain420
UR75514311,2010-16-August,I stayed there in the dorms and had the worst night sleep I'd had in months. There were fleas in the beds roaches all over the kitchen people's things were being stolen out of their locked private rooms and the majority of the people living there were shady people from the city. In an emergency get a private room but don't stay long. One plus was the pool.,rockkey42
UR61416759,2010-15-April,DO NOT STAY HERE UNLESS YOUR ONLY OTHER OPTION IS A BOX UNDER A BRIDGE. Do not trust the photos on the web although the building is genuinely pretty on the outside. This place is a dump. This hotel is beyond filthy to say the least. We drove in at midnight to a lobby filled with apparent prostitutes and junkies too tired to look for another hotel. We arrived at our room via an ancient elevator steeped in a combination of dirty hair and Indian food smells to find a severely unflushed toilet a large and diverse collection of hair all over the bathroom dirty unmatched sheets on aged army surplus mattresses and dust at depths we didn't know was possible to achieve. The cab driver who took us to another hotel the next day said we'd be surprised to hear how many horrified people he picks up there to take elsewhere. We are not prissy--we love camping etc. but do yourself a favor and find another reasonably priced place to stay--this place is just absolutely nasty.,headed_home
UR86976820,2010-13-November,I'm writing this in the hope we will actual get our refund. We stayed here a night and were charged twice for it my partner has been back at least five times to get his $50 refund showed them his bank statement reciept talked to them face to face and sent plenty of emails. We are living in New Orleans so have the luxury to go and tell them to refund us but they are being so slack about it and lying saying it's been sorted out but this happened at least a month a go. the place is total decrepit and not worth staying at. To the Manager if you are reading this we need our refund! It was your staff who screwed up and you need to pay up!,wonderlustmag
UR77843162,2010-1-September,This has to be the worst place I have ever stayed. I was sickened by the conditions of the rooms hallways front desk and lobby. As soon as I walked in I realized it was hotter at the front desk than it was outside. The lady at the front desk was drinking vodka. When I asked to speak to the manager she said she was the manager. I was told there was air conditioning in the rooms. When I got to the room the A/C didn't work. There were also bed bugs so big I could see them. Dead roaches in the hallways no towels in the room. I went down to the front desk to get a refund. The manager told me there was nothing she could do. There were no more rooms and they don't give refunds. I unfortunately had a week booked. I spent as little time there as possible. Every night when I would get back from exploring New Orleans. I would look forward to taking a swim. The pool was the one good looking thing there. Unfortunately the Manager would be in the pool drinking with several men and being very inappropriate. The guys were usually doing cannonball's and splashing obnoxiously.,jasonrs
UR48863552,2009-9-November,After reading the mixed reviews stayed anyway -decided some folks just like to complain...so paid in advance (in cash) to avoid any credit card issues. The draw was the fact of this being a historical site and it was also the Cheapest place I could find (1/2 price of major hotel) and after reading reviews I had very low expectations but the room was not even worth the discounted price. The pics on the website have to be from an ancient time or photoshopped. The room had very bare worn basic accomodations except no phone no drinking cups no hangers only one light bulb in ceiling fan (that didn't work) hanging from a very stained ceiling. Nothing seemed sanitary so spent major money on Lysol spray and wipes just for the doorknobs commode shower and sprayed bed down refusing to sleep under cover so that expense defeated purpose of cheap room. Nothing seem sanitary especially the very worn bed linen and paper thin mattress. Purchased handtowel because not about to use the supplied old worn towel.... too suspect. Can't understand how this place stays open but with major renovation could be nice - it could have charm if taken care of. I did not feel safe during my stay but the location Magazine Street is a great part of the Garden District. Parking was good (and free). The a/c worked! If you are not in the least picky have extremely low expectations or just do not care where you sleep this would work.......just bring necessities as if camping (sheets air mattress pillows cups etc.) and you might make it without complaining like everyone including me has done on this site. I went in with relatively low standards and was still shocked at the unclean creepy dark Stephen King atmosphere.,guardwife1
UR36168069,2009-29-July,It was the worst hotel ever the room floors were dirty the toilet seat had poop on it  the towels were old and torn the cable was out the stairway had no lights in the night so you had to feel your way up and down to avoid breaking your neck. This place should be condemned it is not sanitary not to mention the roaches. Please don't stay here it is beyond terrible.,twotwo678
UR24944764,2009-22-February,REVIEW DATE: Feb 22nd. This review contains accurate descriptions of all aspects of the St. Vincents Guest House I can think of from the Male Dorm Room Experience. Male DORM ROOMS NOT RECOMMENDED. It is recommended that you upgrade to a private room or a different place. Only stay here if you need a place to pass out from drinking and do not have a car/park bench/tent. If you find ANY other person to room with it is highly recommended going elsewhere. I can however run on 4 hours of sleep on low pile carpet so if this is you then it is recommended. ACCOMODATIONS: they have removed all pillows and mattresses (too many bed bugs we concluded) and you sleep on box springs in the dorms - not very comfortable. The couches in the dorm rooms or lounge are taken first. CLEANINGS: Hit and miss. Room cleanings every week or so. Daily cleanup of the property. RATES: PLEASE book online so that they do not charge you $70 per person per night for dorms during busy seasons. MARDI GRAS: This place is SO incredibly decrepid that the even during mardi gras they do not fully book up. AMENITIES: the owners and management closed the common kitchen and do not have any common areas to socialize in. DO NOT COME HERE FOR A HOSTEL EXPERIENCE: There is a conflict of interest with having a restaurant on site - for some reason the restaurant is very busy when the only kitchen is closed???? go figure that the restaurant prices are inflated when tenancy rates here go up! PLUMBING: I just overheard that the plumbing on the entire 3rd floor is broken however the first and 2nd floor do have both hot and cold water (they reversed the hot/cold plumbing in our room for kicks). CLEANLINESS: I give this an A because they actually make an effort to keep the property clean and because the guests do a good job of cleaning. BUGS: I only saw 1 cockroach running around the toilet - but this was during the winter (February). On the ground floor expect spiders but I didn't get any bites. TOILETS: One 3 piece restroom per dorm room of 8 beds. COOKING: Forget it. There are no cooking appliances indoors. There are however 3 rusted hibatchi's 1 broken propane BBQ 1 full sized charcoal BBQ (which we used after much maintenance) and 1 smoker. WIRELESS INTERNET: Only in the lobby -> building is made of brick so even though I have a top of the line wireless laptop I don't get reception in my room. LOCATION: Perfect for seeing the city right on the bus line that will take you downtown and close to the major Mardi Gras Parades if you are here during that time. I give this an "A". RENTAL UNITS: It seems there are a lot of students and transients that will rent monthly for $2100 for 700sq feet. EMPLOYEES: I have heard nothing but griping and groaning from the managers and staff about their work since I started writing this review in the lobby albeit if you ask ANY questions they will answer them. If you ask them for a corkscrew to open wine or how to take the bus or have them call a taxi they will answer with a smile. But "forget about mattresses or pillows" is what I've been told by others. RESTAURANT: I just overheard the woman at the front desk say that the on site restaurant made $1000 yesterday which is a record for this area and for the restaurant. The front desk employee just mentioned she was helping set cutlery yesterday because the restaurant was so busy. I'm no expert on business (I've only taken my MBA) but this conflict of interest does not benefit those who want to cook themselves - or save money by cooking with others. NEIGHBOURHOOD: This is in the garden district in New Orleans - excellent location and beautiful houses. It is an lush and green neighbourhood with an interesting mix of rich family homes with run down slums and social housing ($5/month after Katrina). I was at a parade two nights ago and was 50ft from a shooting where likely a gang member was shot (only 4 blocks from the hostel). Don't worry this is normal for the New Orleans(big american cities and didn't make the papers of course). BEDS: Are assigned - they tell you by putting your bed number on your receipt - creates a bit of confusion. PRICE: I paid $34.95USD by booking 3 weeks in advance for MARDI GRAS. PARKING: I was told by the monthly tenants/long term residents that parking is very safe in the gated off property. SUMMARY: I never write online reviews but this "HOTEL" was such a horrible business and I don't understand why they haven't converted the entire place to rental units. I signed up on to tripadvisor specifically to write this review. STATEMENT OF POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST: I guess the fact that I have become so used to having mattresses/pillows in hostels that it has created a high level of bias towards a terrible experience here (but I am not alone). I have become so used to hostels providing amenities that I didn't realize how terrible things can get when a hostel does not provide those things. I didn't think I needed to pack an inflatable/air/foam mattress but it is the only thing I really need to get a good nights rest. I would not have been so dissappointed if the web site told us to bring our own mattresses. I did bring everything necessary for car camping so we are fairing better than others for a budget road trip.,nibloc
UR24082278,2009-1-February,Bed bugs roaches dirty rooms we could not stay there. Awful nasty. The owners are very rude. Never again. I do not know when they took the pictures on there website but it does not look at all like that maybe 30 years ago. Not a safe place to stay. Please please do not stay there. I would not want my worst enemy to stay at the St. Vincent'sGuest House.,fastfoci2000
UR50440650,2009-1-December,The pictures on Expedia made the Hotel look charming and the History of the place sounded cool. Upon walking in to register the first thing I noticed was it was extremely hot in the lobby if you can call it that. When we got to the room it was not a King Room and the window unit air conditioner did not work. Now mind you New Orleans in July is hot and humid! We requested the room we had booked and upon moving to the new one it was even worse than the first. The bathtub was gross there were make shift closets at least that is what I thought they were supposed to be. I have no problem with old as long as it is clean this place was not! We were not the only people unhappy with the place. Alot of other customers were there for the Essence Festival and some had traveled a great distance with that big of a venue in town needless to say hotels were scarce. The air conditioner was not working in this room either. After seeing a Huge Roach traveling down the hall that did it for me. I literally stayed up all night calling Hotel after Hotel to find a clean place to stay. We went down to the Victorian Tea Room which didn't look as good as the pictures but it was okay until I went to get a coffee cup that was dirty! We checked out immediately and left without securing another hotel. Finally after wasting almost the entire day we found a hotel in Metarie. I would never ever stay here again unless they completely overhauled and cleaned the place up. It really could be a Historical and Interesting place to stay if these things were done. The pictures of the little orphans were cool and you really felt the history of Saint Vincent's. Owner's need to invest money and they could see a major turnaround!,OuterbanksGirl
UR17596315,2008-6-July,Just returned from NO La and the St Vincent Monster house. It was totally awful unless you like bed bugs those big cock roaches and TERMITES. We contacted management. When we arrived we paid for the rooms and went up to check out the room. One of the maids showed us to our room and she brushed all the termites off of the pillow and saw that we saw her do that and she said the room would not do. So she gave us another room and the sheets have not been changed since hurricane katrina. BED BUGS I guess. There were bugs in the bed and the manager said they didn't bother him any that he had them in his bed. In fact I think the hurricane blew away the broom and vacumm. If and when you stay there please be looking out for the Lousiana building inspector as he is on his way. And finally they would not refund us any of our MONEY back. Please think before you stay. You really do get what you pay for .,Pamanne
UR16679034,2008-4-June,We booked our stay at the St Vincent Guesthouse by looking at the pics online reading the amenities (which REALLY need updating) and by the previous experience of the parent of my son's roommate. The pool looks as if it has never been maintained (or is painted green?). The bathroom was fairly clean compared to the rest of the place. It does not have an elevator that is operational and the stairs are not easily climbed. The sheets were holey and stained---really in bad shape. The refrigerator and microwave promised during our phone conversation during the booking weren't in the room when we arrived. There was an overhead fan/light combination located over the bed---which would have been really nice if it had worked. Only one of the lights in it did work (one out of four). There were many amenities listed for this guesthouse that were either no longer available or never were. Thank goodness we were able to find another place or this one could have ruined our New Orleans experience. We left halfway through our paid reservation--after killing numerous spiders and roaches our gloss-out level had been surpassed.,GiannaLynn
UR14682758,2008-31-March,HUGE COCKROACHES - this should say it all. We decided to try St Vincent because of its price and the fact that its location is very convenient - 20 minute walk (not 10 minutes) to the French Quarter and 15 minute to the Garden district. The area is a bit shady but not too bad. The house itself has character but the room we stayed in was NASTY. It had green carpeting that was dirty and really old and as you walked on it the floor would cave in. The most disgusting part was COCKROACHES - they were the size of an adult's THUMB and we killed at least 5 of them - we stayed there for 3 nights (tried to spend as little time in the room as possible). Imagine trying to take a shower in the morning and ready to step into it and seeing a huge cockroach at the bottom of the shower tub. We shook all of our belongings before we left - you do not want to bring any of that back home. The windows were dirty with lots of dead insects (not cockroaches but others) in the window. We stayed on the second floor and our room overlooked a huge GARBAGE pile that looked like it had not been picked up for several months - it did not smell but the view down was not pleasant. Another detail - we booked this through Hostelbookers who charged us 10% deposit for the room to be applied towards the room charge ($15 since we stayed for 3 nights at $50/ night) St. Vincent refused to consider our deposit and charged us the full price ($150 + tax etc) instead of $135 + tax etc. We plan to dispute the transaction. The few positives I can give: The room was large with tall ceilings. But all we wanted was a CLEAN room with a clean bathroom and this was definitely not it. We stayed at hostels before and are students and this was the nastiest hostel we have ever been too. Definitely not returning here.,patrycja1

UR14438799,2008-21-March,Don't ever stay in that crack house!!! Its so nasty and drunks walk the streets. You aren't safe at night! Me and my parents were going to stay there during the Bayou Classic in 06. But its so ugly and old. Don't believe the internet pictures! Its looks like a really old haunted house. The pool is nasty not very clean. The rooms we saw were disgusting! The pillows had stains! The lobby smelled like smoke. Some drunks also greeted us. Its in a bad neighborhood.,lovergurl
UR12270125,2008-2-January,I have stayed at the St. Vincent's Guest House twice it the past 8 months. Both times as a volunteer working to rebuild New Orleans after the devastation of Hurricane Katrina. The accommodations are sub-par to say the least. When we were there in May '07 our shower head did not work. Which was okay seeing as how we were in New Orleans to work not lounge around. And we just used a cup and the tub faucet and we were fine. There was at least one domestic disturbance that took place outside the front of the guest house and did wake up some of our fellow volunteers. Also a cockroach ran across my face while I was sleeping. You definitely had the feeling you should keep your shoes on in the room. Our organization felt it was a decent enough place to stay on our return trip in December. We again had 17 people and several vehicles and St. Vincent's could accommodate all of us at a reasonable price (lower than the advertised price). When we arrived the staff had little knowledge that we were coming and had to scramble to put rooms together for us. (Not all room have heating A/C). The first full day of our trip rained and we were not able to do the volunteer work we were scheduled to do for homeowners in the area. Since we had nothing to do we offered our services to St. Vincent's. They happily agreed to have us paint a guest room and several pieces of furniture. And we were happy to feel useful. Thinking we had established a great relationship with St. Vincent's we were shocked to be asked to leave one night early. You see it was New Years Eve and the day before the Sugar Bowl so they could get more money for the rooms. Mind you we had booked through the first but apparently that was not good enough for them. We then had to find new accommodations on the busiest night of the year in New Orleans. Nice way to treat those who are trying to help you out. St. Vincent's is definitely not worth the advertised $74/night for the conditions of the guest house nor for the attitude of the owner.,Roverbabe
UR14363865,2008-18-March,My friend waited until the last minute to book a room for us and that's how we ended up in this horrible place. First I was worried with the appearance of the building (dirty front broken flower pots etc.). I'll skip the lobby being dirty... and dirty hallways...and the live in residents. The room was horrible as soon as we walked in we saw roaches running around the room (that was my main problem). I don't know for the price of the room I was expecting modest accommodations but clean. The bedding looked dirty (I didn't use the sheets) and there was no phone in the room. I would had preferred to camp out in their parking lot.,bonitamiel
UR12642486,2008-15-January,I made reservations with the place by calling them directly using the number from the internet page several months prior to an accident that put me on a walker. I started calling Dec. 29 2007 to try to cancel reservation. I have stayed there a couple of times prior to 2007. The phone number I used from the internet was wrong. Not once did it enter my mind they would have changed there phone number after having the same on for at least the 4 yrs that I have been going there. I even had operator to try for me with no luck. I sent step daughter to see why there was a problem. I finally reached someone and was told that that I had to cancel 30 days in advance. This is after I tried to reach them from internet number. I checked today and the number still is the incorrect one. I had no idea there was a 30 day cancellation notice. I am sure the room will be rented as that is Mardi Gras week and I could not attend Mardi Gras on a walker. I would be run over by the wonderful crowd attending the celebration. I being charged for one night. This 30 day notice is ridiculous. Our previous stays were not disappointing but to charge a past customer a cancellation fee 15 days prior to the scheduled stay is just poor business and they are gouging there customers. Do not ask if I would retrun or would I recommend others to stay. What do you think?,flgal102
UR17752626,2008-10-July,When we got to St Vincents it promised so much the building is fantastic and is just what you expect a New Orleans boarding house to look like. The front desk staff werent overly helpful but had been an improvement and the friendlyness of the greyhound staff getting here!! We had booked a private room and this looked Ok had a double bed on suite and also a TV. The Hotel itself was in a great location and felt safe it was a 5 min wal to the trolley service and this took only 10 mins to get into the centre of New Orleans and right next to the French Quarter. However it was at night the problems arose!! We got bitten each night by bed bugs well I hope that was all it was. And on the second night we discovered massive cockroaches!! so another night was spent with the lights on! Overall as we didnt spend that long in the hotel it wasnt a massive problem but at night it wasnt the best nights sleep ive ever had and when checking out early in the morning it was obvious that there was a big cockroach problem!,Pounder00
UR7544541,2007-4-May,Room: The room was VERY hot because it only had one window cooler that didn't help much. The mattresses were really hard and crunchy. Some of the lamps didn't have lamp shades. The ceiling fan sounded like it was going to creek off of the ceiling. The fire alarm did not work in our room. One window did not have blinds and it looked out onto the balcony so anyone on the shared balcony could see us sleeping. The TV remote didn't have any batteries. The door did not close well so you could see the light coming through the wide cracks. No A/C in the entire bulding. Bathrooms: The bathrooms were fine. Parking: Good sized parking lot. Front desk: a young woman was VERY nice to us. TERRIFYING NIGHT: I woke up several times because it was so hot. At about 3am I woke up the the fire alarms in the hallway blaring. My friend and I had to get dressed and run down the stairs and outside and call 911. There wasn't anyone at the front desk and no one could locate staff. The guests went through the open rooms to try to find out why the alarms were going off. A half-dressed man finally ran out and turned off the alarm and everyone was told it was okay to go back in but no one had figured out WHY the alarms went off they just dismantled? the system and got upset when we said we called 911. The building had not been completely checked and is so big. SCARY!! The Fire Dept responded about 10 minutes later and gave the all clear...,PhxFemme21
UR10401378,2007-28-October,This was the worst "hotel" i've ever stayed in. It taught me a valued lesson...NEVER GO CHEAP WHERE U R GONNA SLEEP!!My best friend & i decided 2 have a girls only weekend n New Orleans for the Essence Festival & @ the last minute booked this hotel out of desparation & the pics on the web didn't seem so bad. BOY WERE WE WRONG!! We drove past the bldg 3 times thinking it was condemned (it should've been). There were people n the lobby complaining about the rooms & their reservations. We had the same complaints but because of the events...this dump was the only choice. The elevator was not working & of course our room was on the 2nd floor down a dark hallway with a blown hall light! We asked 4 dbl beds but instead had 2 rms. down the hall from eachother with no tv & no air! We were 2 afraid 2 b n seperate rms so we stayed 2gether n a single rm. w/ 1 bed! O did i mention down the street the cops had a house sourrounded because some guy had shot a cop & was holding his girlfriend hostage! If u want 2 go on a survival mission then St. Vincent's is 4 u. But it is NOT recommended for women staying alone (or with anyone for that matter)!,chocolate9520
UR6842519,2007-26-February,I am a college student that read all of the reviews and was not looking for anything top notch at all. Just a place for 12 of us to stay for 2 nights while we party it up in the city. I had no high expectations at all and we were prepared by bringing extra sheets and pillows. We made reservations for 3 rooms with 2 double beds in the beginning of January. We called several times to confirm including more than once during the few days before our stay. When we arrived they had us down for 1 room with 1 king size bed?!?! Wtf is that? They said the internet overbooked and they had priority since they paid in full. They even had rooms where people had not checked in yet that we could not check into. I guess a 3rd party site takes priority over placing a reservation with the front f**kin desk. They offered us the 1 room for free and the rest of us could sleep on the couches in the lobby. Did I mention the bums that were already sleeping on the couches in the lobby. They made one guy leave and then a few more came. Well most of the 12 actually stayed in that one room while a few others miraculously found another hotel WITHOUT THE HELP OR ANY TYPE OF ASSISTANCE from the front desk. The next day the manager said that we would be charged for the 1 room. WELL we WOULD NOT have stayed in it but the night before they said it WOULD be compted. More Lying and I am in dispute with my credit card company on that charge as we speak. The deskclerk was a crackhead we thought as well. The place really was scary which I did not mind but some of the girls did. Many of the lights in the hallways were burnt out leaving it very unsafe. The desk clerk would also leave during the middle of the night leaving no one at all for people to check in with. Overall we probably would have been fine if they had gotten all of the rooms right. We would have put up with the place because thats what we expected from the reviews but messing up the reservation just put it all over the line. I recommend making a reservation here over the internet because since you paid in full you will get your room. Be prepared for crappy service but if your coming into New Orleans for a fun night or two and dont plan on staying in your room which we planned on doing you should be fine as long as they dont screw anything up. I also do not recommend this place for women traveling alone or with only a few. It does not seem like the safest place. Oh and dont attempt to talk to the manager because he is a weak soul. He would not show his face to us even though he was in the office. Abosuletly a worthless being. Well that's my review. No high expectations at all but we got royally screwed.,jmorr34
UR8461198,2007-20-August,Well you know this is a crappy place when there is more than one person disputing charges to a credit card made in error. I made reservations but after seeing the place in person i knew I never wanted to step on the vomit-smelling carpet or sleep in the caved in beds with dirty sheets. After not receiving a reservation # they also couldn't find record of my cancellation -- even though they forged my name on the cancellation form (even got the spelling wrong) - this place needs to be inspected by the Better Business Bureau for its mismanagement!!!! Don't risk the stay in this roach infested joint since the cheap charges will come back to haunt you!,RED_in_BR
UR7186592,2007-18-March,My sister and I stayed for 6 nights at the St Vincent's Guest House. At first the place looked less cosy and much colder than on its website's pictures. But we were not appalled by the dirt such as reported in other client reviews (still we found a few cigarette butts under our bed). We immediately noticed that people were roaming about the halls and down and up the stairs. Were they members of staff customers refugees? We never knew. The staff at the desk was not very helpful and sometimes kind of rude (they gave us a wrong -not updated- taxi phone number for instance). However we did not experience money issues contrarily to what we read on previous customer reviews... After a couple of nights we certainly felt that we had ended up in a very creepy place. Indeed in the middle of the night we could hear some strange and unidentified noises: footsteps in the hall and balconies but never entering a nearby room moving furniture or young kids giggling and jumping in the swimming pool at 3am... On our arrival the lady at the reception desk had told us the hotel was a former plantor's house. But we soon found out (thanks to pictures in the hall and guide books) that the place actually was built in the late 19th century as an orphan asylum which is far less sexy! So considering that the swimming pool was closed for renovation works and also very filthy and that we never saw family with kids in the hotel during the whole week we wonder whether the noises we heard at night came from kids of the neighborhood swimming there (that would mean the place is never locked at night!!) or whether the guy at the tourist center in the French Quarter was right when he told us the place was "dead haunted"???,Emmalabama
UR8036254,2007-1-July,Upon arriving and finding our room we opened the door to find a bug infested dilapidated mess. At least two dozen "roaches" (what the locals call palmetto bugs) ran when we entered the room. The bed was elevated on a couple of bricks that were about ready to topple. Floors were filthy walls were dirty. The place reeked. Obviously inebriated people roamed the halls in the evenings. I would certainly never recommend this place to anyone. It was a nightmarish experience.,marge2007
UR5575202,2006-7-August,Unfortunately I found this site too late. Lesson learned for today never book a hotel and trust the pictures they show. We booked at St. Vincent's since it looked rather nice from the pictures. It was on Magazine street which has some really nice hotels at the beginning of the street (it is a rather long street) so we just assumed it was around there. However we found it in the worst section of town with a woman who looked like she had spent her life on drugs sitting across the street. We were actually scared to leave our vehicle outside. The building looked nothing like the pictures and almost looked like something out of a horror movie. They had already charged my mom's card though so we figured we would tough it out. My husband went in only to get a very ugly attitude from the clerk and to be told she did not have our reservations. She then said the only way she would give us our room was if we gave her our card to hold until we left. UM NO! We left and called Travelocity to ask for a refund. They refused to give it to us saying we had to cancel 24 hours in advance but that they called the place and they were willing to give us our rooms now. We went back and since my husband was so upset I went in to sign the papers and get the room. As I was signing papers and finding out that most of the stuff Travelocity claimed they had they did not a man walked in reeking of alcohol and told me "I am so drunk I am sober." Great! He was soon followed by a series of other questionable people who looked almost like they could be homeless and reeked of marijuana and alcohol who leered at me as they were walking by making me very uncomfortable. Then the lady tells me that while my infant daughter myself and my husband's room is on the 2nd floor of the first building my mom my son and my older daughter will be staying in the third floor of the second building. She then hands me keys for a series of dead bolts on the doors and a few threadbare towels! Right about then my mom comes in because my son had to go to the bathroom. We go around the corner and find a family of about 8 or 10 people in one room. They man and woman were very obviously smoking weed and were screaming at each other. The floors looked like they had not been vacummed in weeks and the front and side doors were left open where any one could just wonder in. We decided to go get something to eat after that and ran out of there as fast as we could. Both my husband and I had a really bad feeling about the place so we told my mom that we would pay for a room in Harvey if she would agree to stay there. She readily agreed and we enjoyed a nice relaxed dinner now that we did not have to worry about waking up to someone holding a knife over us while we slept.,Cajunchic
UR4581815,2006-4-March,I just completed a trip to New Orleans for Mardi Gras. The Mardi Gras was terrific for the five days we spent there. I only wish the accomadations were one tenth as good. I was booked into the St. Vincent Guest Hotel at 1507 Magazine Street. That's about a 2 mile walk from the French Quarter and downtown. There was no elevator working so all the baggage was carried up by me and my wife and outside narrow stairwell. The room was little more that an 10 x 12 room. The window sills were covered in dead insects. The wicker furniture...a single chair and small table were dirty...dust still on both. There was no television which is on of the amenities listed. There was no telephone. Again a missing ameniity. No soap no shampoo. There was lack of ANY maid service for the 5 days we were booked there Each day I had to go donw to the desk and ask for clean towels. On two occassions I was told there were no towels available. Once by the night clerk and once by one the woman I presumed to be the day clerk. She aakded the maid about the towels and the response was that all the clean towels had been given out and no more were available. There was never any attempt to get me any clean towels at that time or during the entire day. Only once in the 5 days did a maid enter the room. The waste basket was emptied and that was all. No fresh linen for entire time spent. No trash picked up except for that single incident. There was coffee downstairs 4 days but the last day even that wasn't available. I asked the manage if it would be possible to cash a few travelers cheques to which he replied ..no. He didn't keep much money around. All in all there was a general lack of concern by management and staff toward us and our stay. I stayed only because the room had been booked well in advance and was paid for other wise I would have been gone the second day. I rated this hotel a 1 simply because I couldn't rate it any lower.,Solitary_Traveler
UR5903450,2006-3-October,I really didn't stay there I was afraid for my life.... no central A/C bathrooms were disgusting the rooms were the worst. Filthy I was scared to touch anything... I waled in and out... and they claim I stayed in there over an hour!!... so they charged me full price anyway. Outrageous!!.... And the area... well close to magazine street yes. But in the worst part!!!... no lights... dark scketchy people on the streets... Not good not good at all. I've been in bad places in my life. This is the worst BY FAR!!!..,Morter
UR4739876,2006-28-March,What a shock it was upon seeing the reality of this "quaint" historic inn! We were thrilled to be with our son before he was deployed to Iraq and chose New Orleans to spend 4 days with him. Unfortunately we chose the St. Vincent's Guest House because of the pictures on the internet. It truly is a lovely building on the outside but once inside we realized we'd been duped. It wasn't the fading frayed carpet-that has a certain charm-the start was the furniture that was stained and a couch with one leg sitting on a block of wood. Next was the clerk who could find no reservation for us even though I had a confirmation number. Then there was the public bathroom-I've seen better gas station bathrooms! Not only was it dirty and smelly there was no soap towels or toilet paper. Walking to a room that we were going to look at we couldn't get lights to work in the hall. Once in the room we were dismayed to find peeling wallpaper a wicker chair that had broken and a dirty bathroom sink and mirror. It wasn't even something that you could consider eclectic and an adventure. We just left-we didn't want to spend time with our son in that place. He commented that he could understand the bathrooms at the barracks at Camp Shelby being theat dirty but not someplace we were spending $80 a night for! We went to the Bourbon Orleans spent more money but didn't worry about lights in the hallways bathroom cleanliness or broken down furniture. And guess what? Their pictures were reality!,A TripAdvisor Member
UR4559363,2006-27-February,This was the worst experience of my life! My friends and I booked a two-night stay during Mardi Gras. We had no money so we figured why not stay at this cheap--- place and save. What a mistake that was! The staff was very rude and not helpful. The man at the front desk even purposefully gave us the wrong number of the cab company to make us look like fools. We did not get the bed accommodations we had agreed to either. After finding a dirty shower cap in the bathroom and a broken mattress we decided to get the hell out of there the second night. They would not refund us more than $25 for the first night despite their incompetent service and lackluster amenities. What ---! Don't be fooled the hotel is friggin ugly and run down despite online pictures. Do yourselves a favor spend a little more money and stay at the Hilton across the street. You'll feel safer (not fearing for your --- life) and they won't rip you off.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR4688839,2006-17-March,This was our 4th visit to New Orleans and our 2nd stay at St. Vincent's. We booked on-line both times. The rate was $25 per person per night. We (2 of us) stayed 3 nights each time. The first time we were billed correctly. This year we were overcharged. When we got home we discovered that our credit card had been charged over $300 for the 3 night stay. We have tried calling and speaking to the owner/manager but we either get no answer or if someone does answer the owner/manager is not available. We have written a letter requesting the over charge be refunded to our account or at least explained. We have yet to hear from anyone regarding this matter and we don't expect we will.,RAPM

UR5617115,2006-16-August,I too read the reviews of the St. Vincent's guesthouse too late (after I had pre-paid through Travelocity) but I am back home in one piece after staying there for one whole week. I'm going to talk about the pros and cons of this facility and give as measured a review as I can. Pros: - As a grad student attending a large conference the accommodations were within my budget. - Front desk staff were not overly friendly but friendly enough and warmed up when I was pleasant to them. Other staff were quite friendly and humorous. When the phone lines were down (see Cons below) a desk person offered the use of her cell phone to make a call. There is sort of a no-apologies kind of mentality among staff -- (i.e. an implied "this is simply how the guest house is." - Within 25 minutes walking distance to downtown NO - a nice walk during the day - Interesting building with an unusual history - Relatively effective air conditioning unit in my room - My bathroom was pretty spotless given the rest of the facility. Also the room was superficially clean (and by that I mean the paint was kind of marked up there were few stains on the carpet etc.) with new carpets. The bathroom contained 2 bars of soap 2 plastic-wrapped cups and clean towels (although there were small stains on some of them that had not come out in the wash) - the bed was clean (I checked for bugs and evidence of bugs as soon as I arrived) with clean linens and was one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in (the double in Room 17) - there is a great little coffee shop across the road called the Mojo. Friendly staff good coffee/tea and relatively fresh baked goods. And best of all free wireless internet access. I do not know what I would have done without this little haven. Cons: - As a female travelling alone I was told by the staff not to walk around at night at all in the area. Post-Katrina the area is quite deserted with pay telephones ripped out and lots of houses that have not yet been renovated after the storm. The adjacent Warehouse District has never been a good place to walk around alone in. I spent a lot on cabs. - The phone lines were completely out for a couple of days towards the end of my stay. There was never a telephone line out of my room although I could ring down to the front desk. Make sure you have a cell phone with you. - Roaches are a fact of life in this facility - I don't mind the little ones (I had about 5 babies and 2 small ones in my bathroom at night whom I tolerated). A huge one came in on my second to last night and being a "live and let live" kind of gal I fashioned a trap with one of my plastic bathroom cups and a pen and transferred him outside. Also there was one big dead roach behind my television set which I left there. - There was only one set of keys to my room and I was given them. This meant that no one could access my room to clean/straighten bed/give fresh towels. (this was also a plus in my mind as it was completely private). The cleaning staff were friendly and inquired if I needed more towels which they hung on my door in a plastic bag. There was evidence that they were cleaning the other rooms (vaccuums a card with towels cleaning supplies etc) - There are people hanging out at the front desk and bottom floor whose position at the guest house is unclear (were they staff? were they friends of the staff? were they people hired to do renovations? were they families staying there post-Katrina?) No one was rude or made me feel unsafe but it was just a little creepy at times. I found that my humour and friendliness was an advantage in these situations. - While my room had new carpet and was fairly clean the hallways were often dirty and the new carpet is not totally throughout the building. Someone chucked a pizza crust outside my door one day and it must have been sitting there for hours before I kicked it into the middle of the hallway so that roaches wouldn't be attracted to it and come nearer to my room. It had been picked up by the morning. I am not sure what effect the hurricanes had on this building but it is anything like other buildings in NO there is probably water damage etc. which would explain some of the mildewy smell. - although it said "no smoking please" in my room the guests before me had clearly been smoking and the room smelled gross until I aired it out for a few days. It was impossible to open the window so by "aired it out" I mean leaving my room door open to circulate the air with the overhead fan on - the shower took awhile to get used to - to find the balance between scalding and cold. - one day after a big rainfall the water came out of my bathroom taps quite brown for a few minutes until they ran clear again. I think that just about covers it. Overall St. Vincent's is a very budget place to stay that would not be suitable for people who would be sensitive to not having all the usual basic amenities and could not put up with what I have described above. I won't stay there again but I am glad I stayed there this time because it was a bit of an adventure. Keep in mind that the clientele of the hotel range from kind of normal people and students to a bit seedy and that the guesthouse itself is located in a pretty run down area. I may post photos in a few days.,Meriloo
UR5805650,2006-15-September,We booked this hotel after looking at the website and pictures which depict quaint rooms and dining facilities. We walked in and were inundated with a disgusting smell filthy bathroom critters running aroud and threadbare towels. Our room left us wheezing but we were told that there was no odor. They also told us that we were early and to come back for our room and that it would be "clean" - when we returned they had given the room to someone else and refused to refund our money (we did dispute with our credit card company) - The rooms were nasty the staff surly - the only good feature was free parking - and since we didn't stay - who knows how safe that was. This was worse than anything I had ever stayed in - and I've stayed at some dives in my days. So run from this - don't let their price fool you because in the long run you'll be paying much more for your stay in NO.,liffycat
UR4618140,2006-14-March,I am a displaced Pediatrician from New Orleans and my former housemate is a professor at Nicholls state. We booked a room at the St. Vincent's guest house for Lundi and Mardi Gras nights. The place was dirty rundown and over-priced. Monday night I was trapped in their shower - it took me about ten minutes to finally get the door to open! It was stiff on closing and almost impossible to open and definitely broken before our arrival! On check out my roommate Dr. Robin White informed the front desk that the shower door was broken. Not only the shower door but the water handle in the shower and my lamp were also broken the mattresses were worn out concave and practically flat in the middle there were papers dead roaches and broken beads under the beds dust flew from the blinds when they were raised etc! Upon recieiving a copy of our less than favorable review from Hostels a $250 charge for the broken shower door showed up on Dr. White's debit card! Mr. Shriver has not returned calls from me or Dr. White. Dr. White went to speak to him about the matter in person today at which point he screamed at her concerning her negative review threw her computer and purse on the floor and had his desk clerk call the police. Dr. White also spoke with the police who have told us this is a matter for small claims court an option we plan to pursue.

UR4460304,2006-14-February,MY boyfriend was making a reservation for the weekend before valentines day and ofcorse everything was booked up. He found St. Vincents online and it was close to the zoo where I had to work that weekend so he booked it. I went and checked the website it looked ok but then i checked on here and read all the reviews and got scared so i went to check it out. Everything is true this place is horrible I would not have sat on the edge of the bed let alone slept in it. Just like the reviews say the first person to finally greet me was a lady holding a huge load of dirty towels and sheets. The carpet which they had told my boyfriend they had just redid looked like industrial carpeting that was DUCT-TAPED to the floor! The rooms were musty and the room they sent me to look at had just been cleaned however the pillows had NO PILLOWCASE and there was only a sheet on the bed no blankets. The Tv was circa 1980 with bunny ears and sitting on a chair. The facility actually looked horrible the "lobby" area and hallways were all dimly lit on purpose i suppose. The staff was of little help while we were there. Thank God i checked it out we then made reservation and had a wonderful time at Country Inn and Suites on Magazine 1 block off of Canal. Their pillows are divine and the rooms were very nice breakfast was WONDERFUL(just wafflescereal yogurt coffee and juice but very good) and the staff at Country Inn could not have been nicer. DO NOT go to St Vincents unless you are VERY desperate and prepared to bring all your own linens and good pair of slippers.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR4972956,2006-14-April,RUN!!!This place is a dump!I would NEVER recommend this place to anyone-EVER.Plus now I have to call to see why they double billed me-ugh.,Alatina99
UR3174878,2005-9-February,My boyfriend and I visited St. Vincent's the weekend before Fat Tuesday. After reading the reviews on this place we were prepared for the worst but had no choice but to keep the reservation as it is impossible to find cheap hotels for Mardi Gras weekend unless you book way in advance or stay far away. When we got there I found out that they had only booked us for 2 nights not 3 like I had requested. They had no issues adding us for that third night but I only wonder if someone else later got cheated out of a room because of their poor room-tracking system. Also I had to tell them that I already paid the booking deposit and while they didn't give me any problems about it and I was charged the correct amount after I spoke up it made their tracking system look even more inefficient. We got to our room and while it wasn't the greatest everything seemed clean and the carpet looked recently vacuumed and we fortunately saw no termites or cockroaches during our stay only a couple of flies. The TV reception wasn't good either but we weren't there to watch TV so it was not a big issue. On the plus side the building had a nice historical feel to it and the neighborhood around it was rather charming as well. I say "charming" in the sense that they are old buildings; unfortunately most are pretty run-down and the neighborhood doesn't look all that safe but it is fine if you walk in the daytime or walk with someone else at night. There are however many great little shops a couple of blocks down (in the opposite direction of the French Quarter) especially antique shops and if nothing else I would love to go back and shop on Magazine St. There is also a great coffee shop across the street from St. Vincent's as a few people have already pointed out. All in all if you are not picky and come prepared St. Vincent's is ok. Just make sure you bring a confirmation sheet if you book online and if you're worried about the linens bring your own.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3342929,2005-7-April,We stayed at this hotel as the photos on the website made it appear fantastic. It couldnt have been further from the truth - the place is totally run down and not cared for at all which is a shame because it is such a gorgeous building. Our room was dark damp it had a filthy carpet the bedside cabinets hadnt been dusted in months there were cobwebs on the ceiling and the wall the curtains were filthy as was the window ledge. The duvet cover had a massive burn hole in it (but the sheets were clean at least) and the bathroom was appalling. The bath had black filthy marks on it where nobody has bothered to scrub it clean ever. At breakfast we asked for some butter for our toast and we were given the used butter pot off of another table that hadnt even been cleaned yet the butter had knife marks in it of the people that had used it before us. The lady on reception when we checked in wasnt helpful either she wasnt interested in the fact that we thought wed booked under a certain tariff all she cared about was getting our money there and then. Her tart answer was that the manager would be in in the morning so wed have to see him then. We were completely appalled and certainly wouldnt recommend this hotel to anyone unless it changes management.,chickenne
UR3735329,2005-3-August,I loved New Orleans and expect to journey there as much as possible. March 2005 was my first visit after talking about going for many years. I went with a companion and right away started looking for accommodations. We started researching suitable lodging. We stayed for two nights at the Hyatt and thought that it would be charming to stay at a campy romantic hide away off the beaten track. After perusing many sites offering rooms bed and baths I came upon St. Vincents Guest House. Reading the description location history and price I simply thought that this would be quaint exactly what I was looking for. I was simply looking for a experience anyone can stay at a nice hotel this to only mean that my expectations were not the highest. After having a funfilled two days in wonderful New Orleans we packed our bags with anticipation and proceeded to our next home away from home for the next two days. We hail a cab gave them the address. I knew immediately that we were doomed the taxi driver did not exactly know how to get there. The site had indicated that the guest house was merely blocks away from the quarter. Remember we had been all over the quarter for the past few days and was excited and talked about taking strolls to other tourist spots. I quickly understood that would be impossible since the cab ride took at least 1/2 hour and the driver was obviously confused. We passed construction we passed empty store fronts obvious street corners where the down and out had staked out as there territory. Then suddenly here we are in front of St. Vincent's guest house. Still with optimism we paid the driver and walked up the steps anticipating sitting in the wicker chairs with the fans overhead and maybe even enjoying a cocktail. When we approached the front desk that was filled with dirty laundry and got the attention of the receptionist my companion looked at me with a I told you so. He was not thrilled when I had told him about the guest house. Of course I proceeded with faith that all would be well and I would be able once we arrived to have the I told you so. After checking in and remember that your bill is paid prior to coming and I mean the money in the bank is gone! We asked where the elevator was since we had alot of luggage (whats a girl gonna do?) she said that it was broken. We proceeded up the stairs lugging and huffing an puffing the luggage along with us. Halfway there an attendant says to us why are'nt you folks using the elevator? We replied it's broken he responds no it is not its over there. Is it broken or not that is the question at hand now? WIth trepidation we approach another attendant who is surrounded by dirty dishes speaks. Hey that elevator is broken folks you can not use it. Oh well we will walk to the room could you please direct us? He points in the direction where we should go and then says open that door and walk on the terrace and then go through another door and you should be able to find your room. Lo and behold he's right after following instructions we find our home away from home lodging for the next two days. I must mention that there were other signs that made me realize that upon opening the door I would be greatly disappointed. Sign 1. elevator snafu. Sign 2. everyone is sitting surrounded by dirty laundry and dishes. Sign 3. finding the room took a road map and I was lucky that the veranda terrace what ever did not fall from the weight. I take the key while my companion wipes the sweat from his face from the trek. I open the door and to my huge and utter disappointment I am suddenly in hell! The room was dirty the walls were dirty the floor dirty the towels dirty the bathroom was dirty. The beautiful white wicker furniture was not white it was worn kinda brown from the lack of paint hey there is only one wicker chair. The overhead fan well lets just say it was moving in a circular motion good because this rooms smells. The bed now the bed was small but the linen was dirty and thin and dirty. I looked at my companion he looked at me and we proceeded to get out our cell phone and took the phone book that was so nicely left in a handy location. I could not sit down the room was so dirty as I called other hotels with hopes that there was a room left for to stay. After many phone calls we were able to find alternative diggs. We dragged our luggage the way we came with comments from other attendants that did not realize the elevator was broken as they wondered why we were not using it. I went back to the front desk remember I booked the room on-line and read the cancellation rules. If you cancel then you lose one day of the bill. Got it please just refund the other back to my account. She lets me know that gee she can not do that only the manager can well where is the manager? Not here perhaps somewhere? Okay I am on vacation no reason ot lose it is there? I am in the south away form the the hustle and bustle of San Francisco. Hey lady just tell me the procedure I gotta go. She hands me a piece of paper with a name and number of the person who handles refunds. I continue along my merry way and manage to enjoy New Orleans like none before me. Oh by the way I never got a refund after constant trying and just chalk it up to having the experience.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3302529,2005-26-March,We go to New Orleans a few times a year and expected from the address that this would be OK. We were going over a holiday weekend and all our regular places were marked WAY up so we gave it a try. We were there all of 10 minutes. Even knowing that the city was booked up and that we were going to be gouged if we did find a new place we left. We were prepared to turn around and go home if that was what it came to--a six hour drive. The place smelled awful there were cars that were presumably abandoned sitting in the side yard the furniture was shabby and everything was dirty---really dirty. Our room was maybe 10 by 10--maybe. Avoid it. (Luckily we were able to check in at the just-opened Country Inn and Suites and were given a hot rate of $79 for a $169 room when I explained that we'd already paid for another place. We've stayed all over the city always trying new places but from now on we're staying at the Country Inn. I know it's a chain but the one in NOLA is a charming one. But hey the Ritz is a chain too--and my husband says he likes the Country Inn better than the Ritz in New Orleans. I'm not going that far but Country Inn earned my loyalty.) As for St. Vincent's what I think is going on is that the owner has got this massive property in a gentrified area so s/he is just holding on until the right offer comes--and not spending any money during the wait.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR4048509,2005-24-October,I wish I had never made the Reservation(1019MO). It began with us arriving late after informing Peter(the Owner) of this.He said he would leve the key at the Front Door. we arrive 1130pm and the front door was close and the side door was open. We went in and the smell hits you. My wife was appprehensive at first but we found a key and went to the room (it was occupied)WE had no place to stay and no one to talked to.We went to nearest Police Station and asked them if we could stay in their parking lot until the morning and we would return to the Hotel.At 8am we went back and Peter said he was sorry for the problem and that we should return at 5 pm and he would have a room for us( my wife was not to happy but agreed to do so) by 5:30 no call so we called them and were told they had no spaace for us and Peter would not talk to us on the phone.We were dumped by this dump.....We got to a phone and started calling hotels and got the Chateau in the French Quarter who told us to come by right away they had a room for us......we left the Roaches the smell and the nasty attitudes at St. Vincent. I will never ever stay or recommmened this place to anyone not even my dog would stay there. I was in New Orleans to help with the Katrina relief and I got screwed and insulted.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3605810,2005-23-June,I'm not too picky when it comes to hotels motels and B +B's. I've stayed in former insane assylums in homes owned by people hostel to Americans and am always prepared with my own pillows and shampoo because hotel's aren't likely to have the best of either. This place however really has me peeved... not just because our shower curtain was terribly mildewed the hot water handle took 2 people to turn on there was inadequite tv reception on all local channels the elevator moved when you stepped on it the breakfast was bad the pool was dirty the room was smelly and we were given a room with 1 bed instead of two... but because my credit card was double charged and after two weeks of requesting refunds by phone and e-mail/ providing full documentation I was still being given the run around and only a partial refund because the area was missrepresented (with staff telling me it was a short walk to several restaurants "See our brochure") and after walking 1.5 miles on blistered feet through a questionable neighborhood I only found 2 places and an A&P and because the check-in process took 30 minutes because the staff wanted to have an argument over personal matters instead of seeing to my needs (though I told them I was in pain and needed to be settled as soon as possible). The good points: easy parking large rooms "history" a "nearby" restaurant with really good Mediterranian food and cheap prices (if you don't get double charged).,Elspeth
UR3398778,2005-22-April,We arrived after over 7 hrs. of driving to learn that the price had gone up by $10.00 per night and the deposit had gone up by over $100.00; the booking clerk from God knows where had already applied $50.00 to our credit card for the deposit. With Thanksgiving football fans filling up other places and two tired and hungry children at 7 PM at night we bit the bullet and signed the VISA paperwork after arguing with the deskclerk over the sudden price increase as well as the new amt. of deposit. We entered a dingy room with torn and faded bedspreads.....immediately we found that the tv would not work....next we tried to turn on the window air conditioner and it shocked me! The little fellow who responded to our desk call was friendly enough and repaired the problems The next morning I saw others complaining as we sat down to a breakfast with no milk no margarine....I told the kids to pretend we were camping out for $98.00 a nite! It was apparent the kitchen staff did their best but the tired excuse" We have to go to the store" wore down after two days of no milk and no margarine. I watched as two older ladies from Australia sat and waited and waited and waited for margarine when I knew full well that was the same story the day before. Finally they gave up and left. The next nite the toilet overflowed all over the bathroom and the little New Orleans critters I'd noticed holed up in the bathroom ran for their lives and took up residence in the thinly carpeted area WITH US!! I took the name of the owners and wrote them a letter when we returned home and their response to all our problems and overcharges in a nutshell was "So what?" The cute photos of chidren and cleaner days gone by and the kind kitchen staff are not enough for me to ever spend another night in this dirty urine scented and bait and switch establishment!!. After many travels and using many B&B's all over Europe this is the most horrible excuse for lodging I've even been exposed to. Somebody needs to report this sham to the Tourist Commission of New Orleans and the Health Department ta boot!! Don't even think the place looks like the photos posted by the management!!!!,Twinferret
UR3794468,2005-21-August,This was the worst and nastiest place I've ever stayed they didnt ever even clean your sheets and the place had looked as though someone been there before with out being cleaned up There where roaches the size of rats the Electric didnt work in a lot of places our phone didnt work all the furniture is busted up I could keep going but Ive said enough for a place this if there going to make it into a guess house get a decent crew new furniture for god sake just it needs to be redone all the way....,A TripAdvisor Member
UR4252850,2005-20-December,We got to New Orleans on Sunday before the 2005 Sugar Bowl. My friend had booked a two full-bed room for four people to stay in. They didn't have one. Said the reservation only had us for a twin. With a little griping and an up in pay we were "upgraded to a one full-bed and and two roll away cots. Roll away cots being a luxurious term. We were given at the best two of those foam camp mats with two sheets two blankets and one pillow for two straight guys. Not to mention that the front door is locked at 10p you can take a drunken climb up the fire escape and then scale a ten foot rod iron fence on the second floor to get away from the craziness that surrounds this place. Even though you make it past the front lines you still need in your room for total safety; but that requires the key that my buddies still had down on Bourbon. You can wonder the dim halls late at night but be aware of Eastern European immigrants that stroll in at all hours are very rude and do not speak English. If you are looking for the experience of your lifetime this is the place to stay; make sure though you go during a busy time of the year that makes all the difference. Enjoy your stay but watch out for the millions of ghosts of the poor orphans that died of malaria and yellow fever when St. Vincent's was still an orphanage/morgue.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3790649,2005-19-August,No atmosphere no room service fresh towels never provided hallways and outside areas unkempt and untidy. TV not working and no hairdryers. Too many cockroaches.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3674394,2005-17-July,The price attracts everyone to this guest house...and the free parking but its sure not through word of mouth. We arrived to find one mighty creepy old building! The staff obviously were not happy with their choice of employment...no southern hospitality here! The building is in a serious need of a major overhaul. We were shown 2 different rooms...we choose the lesser of two evils. The bedspereads were stained the hallwalls were dark dank and dirty. There were two sets of towels for a room that slept four. The windows were nailed shut and painted in plexiglass...how classy can you get?! I had to remid everyone "we are here to see places and do fun things...we're just here to shower and sleep". The elevator is in serious need of repair when the door opens to your floor the thing jerks up and down typically stopping several inches lower or higher then level to the hall floor! Scary seedy and totally unacceptable. Do not even bother.,Mora11272
UR3779362,2005-17-August,I located the hotel on the website. It looks nothing like what is online. When I arrived late at night there is no working attendant to assist you. Your key is taped to the front door. A resident had to show me to my room. The elevator is shaky and does not stop even with the floor. The hallways are dark damp and the hotel smells of mold and mildew. The hallway to the room was dark. The room is dimely lite smells of mold and the sheets have spots on them. This is not a clean comfortable save place to stay. There is no one there at night if you have a question problem or need anything. DO NOT STAY HERE,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3011212,2005-16-January,Pictures were cute but the place is run down beyond comprehension! they put us all the way on the top floor with no one else staying up there and there was no phone in the room. The room was filthy stains on the sheets air conditioner did not work. We got in late so we dealt with it for the night but the next morning asked for another room. They said they would have one ready in a few hours and for our "convenience" would move our things to the new room while we are out. Gee that's hospitable right? We got back was told where our new room was. Our things had been moved as they said but a pair of my shoes were missing. I know I left them next to the bed in the first room because I planned to put them on when we changed for the night. The staff told me they had already put new people in the first room (in that condition????) and that no one saw the shoes. The shoes never showed up. The second room was even worse the sink and the shower kept backing up the vents were full of thick dust particles air conditioner still didn't work no reception on the tv that showed 1 channel the blinds were broken and others could see in to our room spiderwebs over the door thresh hold the door had no real lock on it so we put a suitcase in front of the door in case someone decided to come it. The rugs were dirty and seemed to be water damaged or something it smelled like mildew the elevator was broken and had been for months. We couldn't get a refund so we decided to suck it up for the next 2 days thinking we wouldn't be in much anyway. The next morning we went down to breakfast which was served on styrofoam plates that had cut marks on them clearly showing they were previously used!!!! NASTY!!!! We went out that night to the French Quarter and came back to find that there were NO lights on and that the front door was locked so we walked around to the back door which was open but we feared for our safety. It is not a good neighborhood to be in the dark with no lights! Mosquitos ate me alive in the room the pool was filthy..FILTHY!!! The place could actually be charming given it's history but I felt like I could have gotten the plague myself in those conditions. We got back home and saw that we were OVERCHARGED for the room after all of this and called for a correction. It never happened. I opened a case with the Better Business Bureau to find that not only was I not the only one to do that but that the hotel has a history of not responding..I was no different. I never got my money back my shoes never showed up and I am NEVER going back there...be warned!!!!,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3354567,2005-13-April,This isn't the worst place to stay in New Orleans as long as you don't need help at night. The night person was "missing" for a long time and there was a line of people waiting phone ringing etc... ALSO... the office area was left open with the keys and everything in there out in plain sight. The employee that FINALLY showed up was very rude and sarcastic and started telling us about how she only gets paid $6.00 per hour. I couldn't believe it!,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3628342,2005-1-July,We went online to view this hotel that we found at a reasonable price. The picture showed a wicker bedroom set that looked adequate for the price. The dining room showed a wicker dining room setting. They showed a manicured landscape. Upon arrival we were in shock to find a terrible dump. It was obvious the hotel had not been renovated as it appeared to be online. As we entered the hotel we encountered an old damp musty mildew smell. The carpet was old worn dirty. and faded. As we were shown to one of the rooms we smelled gas in the courtyard. The bedroom had dark black background flowered curtains and the bedspread had a faded brown background with squares. The smell was nauseating To top it off there was a table with droppings from an unknown animal that was roaming the hotel. Just outside of the dining room was an old worn safa that had a cushion coming out of the cover and the zipper was broken. The picture shown online is very misleading. The airport shuttle bus driver referred to it as the Hemon Monster mansion. We agreed when we got there. We went out in the rain to find anotther room.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2172288,2004-8-June,Remember the movie "BIG" where the little boy wishes to be older and turns into a man (Tom Hanks) and goes to the city. This looks like the room he stayed in. We arrived and signed in at the desk (not being made aware that we were signing a statement that our credit card would be charged for one night if we did not stay the night for any reason). We went to our room and did not even sit on the bed. The place was nasty. The place smelled. The pool was green. We did not feel safe staying the night. The person at the front desk was notified that we would be leaving. They would not refund our money because of the statement we had unknowingly signed.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2267888,2004-5-July,Rooms & amenities looked good on webite. Got there and the people laying around on the dirty couches in the dirty lobby turned out to be employees. First room they showed us was filthy dirty bathroom. Second room they showed us had filthy rugs with stains sagging springy beds and bugs. Since it was busy Essence Fest time no other hotels available. We slept in our van!! Time for checkout in morning and no one was there to check us out. Had to leave key behind the desk!! Terrible Service!!!!!,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2123994,2004-27-May,A group of 4 of us stayed here last Fourth of July. It's not the worst place to stay but there are alot better out there. At the time of our stay - we were not able to get the original rooms they had for us. They had plumbing problems and put us in different rooms. The room I was in had stains all over the carpet - looking like someone tossed their cookies & left it. From the look you can tell they recently had painted the walls. The other room had a bad musty smell and the two in that room refused to sleep under the covers. What I considered the plus side is this hotel does have character formerly being an orphanage. They do serve you breakfast and the staff is extremely nice. Unless you need something in the middle of the night & then you are on your own. There is a nice place across the street you can get coffee and such. It is close enough to walk to the convention center and town if you need to. The trolley does go by the hotel but passed the hotel every single time & made us walk back to it. One time it was 2am in the morning. Hope this helps.,cruisinmeli
UR2788070,2004-26-October,I'd booked my reservation through Loney Planet's website and had an email confirmation sheet credit card deposit payment etc. with me but when I called to say my flight was delayed and I would be an hour later than expected I was told they had NO record at all of my reservation. This may happen only on busy weekends but call and make sure your reservation is set several times before you go. Of course they had no rooms available that night my tough luck. Chances are if you're booking St. Vincent's you're on a budget. If it's a Friday night good luck finding a room elsewhere for under $100. Sadly this has happened to me before with budget hotels in New Orleans---what can you do sue them in small claims court for $30? I'm sure the hotel is fine but beware of reservation glitches particularly if you are traveling from a distance and intend to sleep that night!,Sphynxy
UR2785715,2004-25-October,This place looks great on the website but when you see your room a dark reality will set in. The room was dirrrrrrrty. The carpet was matted with hair dust and creepy crawlies. I discovered why when I borrowed the vaccum from the maid; the belt on her vaccum was broken and has been broken for some time. After informing her of this she said "It work fine fa me". The bedspread had mystery stains on them. I remedied this however by discovering the unlocked hotel laundry room on the floor where I washed all the bed linnens and covers. The cruddy AC unit in the room should have came with a legionarre's disease pamphlet. The pool is full of leaves dirt bugs and the urine of drunken patrons (NOT KIDDING). After requesting fresh towels on the second day of our stay they were tied to the door handle in a plastic bag however another guest must have needed the towels more than us. When I went to retrieve the towels all that remained on the door handle was a tattered plastic bag. I could go on for several paragraphs but why? Bottom line; stay elsewhere unless you want to get some rare fungal skin infection from this filthy place.,Tincture77
UR2844579,2004-24-November,Stayed there 10 times always cuz of the cheap price. U get whats ya pay for. No security at nite in a scary neighborhood. encountered many problems w/ all my stays. finally had enuff when i came back to hotel at 2 am and my key would not work on front door or outside stairs metal cage door. had to climg 12 ft high fence w/ spires on itfell 10 ft to concreteripping me shirt and nearly killing myself. no apology fro the owner next morning. had a "mystery" seperate 20 dollar charge on me card. rat traps visable in hallway. nasty pool. cheap styrafoam plates and bad food for breakfast. crappy tv setsno cable bring your own clock/radio for music and wakeup. 2 redeeming aspects...in daylight it is a short walk to cool shopping area and rue de la course across street serves best coffee but has a tattoedpierced "hipper than thou" staff....surrey's 2 blocks away is hand down one of best eclectic and yummy eaterys for breakfast and lunch...St Vincents NEVER AGAIN!!!,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2312966,2004-21-July,I really hate to have to say anything about St. Vincent's because Peter was a genuinely nice fellow but this joint is a dump by any standards. I've travelled extensively and do not consider myself too particular beyond requiring basic sanitation. St. Vincent's fails miserably in this regard. It was unquestionably the filthiest place I've ever stayed. The good news is that there is ample free parking in the adjacent parking lot (though the lot is unsecured so it's not much better than the street). And there is a terrific coffee shop across the street (which you'll need since you won't want to eat or drink anything from the Saint Vincent's kitchen). In short stay somewhere else.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2304866,2004-17-July,WARNING! After reading ALL of the horrible online reviews of St Vincents Guest House AND hearing a first hand account from a friend who encountered condoms in the hall/stairs bugs in their bed urine and other "questionable" fluids on the walls we CANCELLED our reservation with several weeks notice. I have my cancellation number. NOW today I received my credit card bill and found that this place falsely charged my credit card for a stay! I not only plan on contacting St Vincents my credit card company but state and local authorities. This isn't some one time accident. Read these messages others have posted similar fraudulent charges to their credit cards. This place obviously has a pattern of pulling this type of scam on tourists and should be closed down! This type of thing simply should not be allowed to happen. They charged the wrong girl this time.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2885393,2004-16-December,I will give this hotel 2 stars only because it has a great coffee house across the street and a bus stop 1 block away for easy inexpensive access to the french Quarter. I travel to different cities and write music reviews for a magazine. I am not one to be scared of a location or cheap hotel rooms but I personally would not reccommend this hotel to anyone. My room was very dirty and bed linens were questinable. There was not an ice maker in the hotel working but I did manage to get a few pieces of ice to make a drink. What bothered me the most was waking up to a dead rat in the middle of the hallway right outside my door. Hey I don't mind the rodents there -just don't let me see them. There is no maid service so if you need extra towels make sure you ask for them at least an hour before you plan to leave the hotel for the day b/c they will not be hanging on your door when you return. The Tv will only work with rabbit ears so for 4 days I had no tv b/c I did not get reception in my room. The staff was very nice and they will try to accomadate you any way they can - but beware of the kitchen nazi who felt betrayed b/c I did not want to purchase her 2 pancakes and eggs for the same price I could get a real LA breakfast elsewhere. I had no problems with my reservation or even having to send a check deposit early but I did call and confirm my reservation 3 times. Great shopping on magazine street!!!,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2825382,2004-15-November,Read the mixed reviews but booked anyway for the end of October being ever hopeful. Have to agree the old-time atmostphere is great. We loved the building as a whole the impossibly tall doors the balconies the courtyard. The free parking area next to the hotel was a real plus for us and was one of the reasons we booked there. We did use the pool area which was clean and orderly. Also the hotel is relatively close (20-25 minute walk) to the French Quarter - we walked sometimes used the very convenient bus and street car at other times. However I have to admit that the place needs a good cleaning - regularly. The hallways staircases and rooms need to be swept/vaccumed. The rug in our room obviously had not been cleaned before or during our stay. Cobwebs and dead bugs. In our double room neither bed had a mattress pad and the sheets had cigarette holes in them. No pillow covers just cases over foam pillows with questionable stains. As far as the free breakfast referred to in earlier reviews it was hit or miss. As breakfast is served from 8:00 - 10:00 we had to miss it sometimes due to early plans. On the first day we were able to partake of breakfast the cook had a late start no eggs available at 8:30 no milk purchased so no cereal. We were offered two pancakes apiece and some coffee and juice. Second day they were able to add milk so there was cereal for our daughter. Really not much of a breakfast. No pasty no meat no yogurt no fruit and on the second day no toast - ran out of bread. I wouldn't in good conscience recommend St. Vincent's Guest House.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2190877,2004-15-June,You are hereby warned!!! I read postings abouot this place being bad and ignored them thinking they were posted by people who have only stayed in the Four Seasons. I thought I could tough it out since I have slept in the mountains on many occassions and have slept in hostels and other shady places in South America Spain Germany Italy and France. Those people who put up those postings I ignored can now say "I told you so." This place was filthy. When we walked up the stairs to our room there was garbage strewn about the hall. The carpet in our room was filthy -- various stains thorughout stiff portions of the carpet from god knows what being spilled on it. The shower curtain had the lovely charm of mildew climbing up the inside. The curtains on the windows were covered in black dust. They only partially obscured the view of a dilapidated porch strewn with leaves branches coke beer cans and other assorted trash. My wife who is from a third world country and is not used to nice accomodations refused to walk on the carpet or shower without shoes. The pillow case and this is not a joke had a printing on it that said the following: "Property of Tulane ... Hospital. Removal from the hospital is a misdemeanor." There was a used plastic cup of water waiting for us when we first entered the room above the makeshift closet. As the last poster indicated the pool was green and disgusting. There were however two redeeming things about this place- good water pressure and good ac. thats it. it is a total rip off for 89 bucks a night. the omni a gorgeous hotel with full service costs 120 a night. New Orleans must be a fun town if you like to party but do not stay here unless you're still in college or will be too smashed to give a damn about where you are staying.,akazin
UR2188674,2004-14-June,What a ripoff! This place is a dump with a capital D. We arrived late in the day tired from having worked all day catching a plane etc. As we were driving into the neighborhood my wife asked the cab driver if he was sure he had the correct area. The photo's on the site appeared to be of a nice charming well maintained hotel. The driver assured us it was the correct address dropped us off and then sped off as quickly as he could. I didn't want to try finding another place to stay so I convinced my wife to be open-minded. We signed the form gave our credit card and went to check out the room It was so bad my wife was ready to cry!! We tried to get them to refund our credit card but they refused. DO NOT EVEN CONSIDER STAYING HERE! I DISCOVERED THIS SITE AND THE REVIEWS TOO LATE!!!,A TripAdvisor Member
