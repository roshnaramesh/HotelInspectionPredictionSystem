UR123354426,2012-20-January,I had a chance to stay 1 night in Hotel Riverside Studios and I know it was my last visit at this hotel. The interior of the building is very old fashioned and I would recommend you to go through the dark corridors to your room only if you want to feel like in a horror movie. There are shared toilets as well as dirty bathrooms. Maybe it could be a good hotel for drunk people returning from the pub who don't care about where they will sleep in next 5 hours. On the other side the courtyard view rooms are quiet.,Petr U
UR122373124,2012-1-January,we arrived in NY expecting alot we got alot! the showers had hair i them we had food under the bed and the long dirty hallways felt like we were walking in a horror movie. we never saw any staff other than the grumpy receptionist. ... interesting yes,samgillett7
UR120251727,2011-6-November,It's certainly not worth the $128 I paid for it. Only thing I will give it is that I have worked at summer camps and lived in a tent for a summer which was better but the sheets were clean. The police officer story: we went to the vending machine for a snack and when we came back 3 officers asked if we lived there? We said no and they said well there has been complaints by residents who said its being used as a hotel. We said we were staying the night and they told us that it is not allowed to be used as a hotel and who did we get the room from. I said travelocity and they said well try and get your money back. SERIOUSLY if they are right and why would they be there if not then believe me when I say its NOT a hotel! MY FIANCEE WAS SCARED THE WHOLE NIGHT - couldn't afford anywhere else at short notice...,gmansa80
UR118950863,2011-5-October,well where do i start the room was booked by my friends who flew in from overseas we arrive on 10/1/2011 love the vicinity it is located in but the lobby looks like a crack house that i have seen on tv the elevator was so small that 2 adults with large handbags would not fit comfortaby the rooms smelled strong of old ciggarettes and pee the bed sheets were marked and the heater was painted in an ugly pink the tv did not work the view outside was so crappy this bldg should be shut down its horrible we complained to the BBB cause these living conditions for anyone is not healthy they did not take a cancellation fee cause they told us we will not find a hotel room on the upper west side this close to the city for 700$ but we did at the hampton inn on 6th avenue.i advise anyone do not stay there (riveraide hotel),Natasha Wishuwe...

UR91837460,2011-5-January,This was the most disquesting place that i have ever been to in my life. Everything is filthy the rooms are very small the sink in the room looked like it was going to fall off the wall. the TV was von top of a nasty little refridgerator and the remote had no back to hold the batteries in. It looks like no one ever cleansin the place and it is very smelly!!! The sorry excuse for a hotel seems more like tiny apartments turned into rooms with no bathrooms. PLEASE....P L E A S E ...... PLLEEEEEEEEASSSSSE NEVER GO to this sick nasty place!!!!! YOU WILL BE WASTING YOUR MONEY,malijax
UR118945773,2011-4-October,Attendant totally lazy and provided false info in order not to move or do anything. Rooms have moss which is unhealthy. only good thing about it is location. noisy outside due to construction but they promised a quiet room.,worldtraveler2392123
UR102255407,2011-31-March,My trip was for business and my girlfriend who traveled with me booked a room at this hotel without really looking into it. What a MISTAKE. When she made me aware that we didn't have our own bathroom in the room but would be using a "shared bathroom" I should have known this would be a disaster. But looking on the bright side of how cheap it was in a good location in NYC I decided we could grin and bear it. But I have never in my life experienced such a horrible stay in a hotel. The place smelled so bad upon walking into the lobby. The guy at the desk could barely check us in because him and some bums that were hanging out there with him were hitting on us the entire time. Then we go through a series of hallways that look like they were from a horror film to get to the elevator which looked like a door to a closet. Once inside the elevator you can barely breathe it smelled so bad and you had to hold your breath. There are people that live here apparently because the place used to be an apartment building so some peiople still live here for around $50 a week. These people could be mistaken for homeless people though which was sad. But they had signs that made no sense taped to their doors also flags and signs with obscene gestures and profane language on them!!! The room was awful. Decor didnt match was broken and stained and looked like it came from salvation army. I SWORE the bed was wooden when I sat on it it was so hard. There were dead bugs behind all the furniture. Outlets hanging out of walls. Only a sink in the room..so then we went to check out the shared bathroom. Pubic hair everywhere. Feces on floor on toilet on walls and near toilet paper holder. A sign was on the door saying "If you don't like the dirty bathroom CLEAN IT YOURSELF"!!!!! My friend and I were so upset that we tried checking out but would not only loose our money but everywhere else nearby was too expensive since most halfway decent places didn't have rooms. So we decided to deal with it. Woke up in the morning with the worst back pain in my life thanks to the bed. I had bites on me that I assume were from bed bugs. Squatted when using toilet and showered in flip flops. The water kept going from ice cold to burning hot when showering. The people who stayed there kept banging on the bathroom door when you take a shower. The heat in the room didn't work. I cant believe we made it out alive. SPARE YOURSELF THIS NIGHTMARE and DONT STAY HERE!!!!,janine0802
UR94607833,2011-27-January,This hotel is more like an old student dormitory with shared restroom/bathroom. The hotel condition is bad. The location is the only good thing. The staff was very rude when we asked if there is hot water available.,samh57
UR119682596,2011-24-October,Well if you are a rude traveler this hotel could seems an acceptable place to you. If you are such a person that only books 4 or upper stars hotels this one could means a terrible experience to you. Points in favor: It's near from everywhere in Manhattan island It's the cheapest hotel in the island You have shared bathroom maybe as accident you can know such a beauty girl with few clothes. Points against: It smells from the main door to anywhere inside. It's not a vomit smells but means that it has not a good cleaning and ventilation. As Argentinean I could say that it's extremely expensive. In Argentina with 100 bucks you can book a real good hotel maybe 5 stars. But considering that it's in Manhattan maybe riverside studios worth it. Shared bathroom there's not to much to say about this. If you don't use shared bathrooms this will be a terrible experience. In my own advice If you are such guys that go to new york and dinner in MacDonald's this is your best option. If you go to new york to live the top stars glamor just discard this webpage. Bye!!!,matias q
UR97745055,2011-23-February,Hands down the worst hotel I have ever stayed in...I should have know from the beginning as there is no parking for this hotel on a dead end street. As we entered the lobby and found our way to the elevator and eventually to our floor...as the door to the elevator opened to our floor it was written in black sharpie " 3rd Floor" as well as other graffiti.... As we entered the room (1) large burn mark from an Iron on the floor (2) blood smears on the wall as well as a host of dirty hand prints (3) dried boogers on the wall (4) You share a community bathroom which had urine all over the floor and smelled.....I immediately asked for another room and was given one next door... I opened the door to see toenail clippings on the floor...hand prints and boogers on the walls and a broken heater that could not be turned off..I called the front desk but was told to open the window which already had masken tape on it & I was to open the window in Feb...I had to go to the front desk passing numerous roaches to get pliers and a crank to turn my own heat off as a paying customer...This Place was a FLOP house......We went to cleaner hotel in Jersey.....,Dwilliams79
UR114628034,2011-22-June,I have never seen such a difference between a internet photo /review and the actual hotel.I am from the travel Industry and have travelled for 20 years to over 44 countries. Fortunately i only needed to selep and was busy the 2 days i was there. Rude staff.Totally lonley hotel. Even water vending machine was not working. The design of this building maybe First world war time!! and if you have luggage the multitude of doors and floors will tire you. The carpet was definately during Teddy Roosevelts time. South Asians ( i am one) who run motels in western countries must learn from Asia the art of service with a smile.It costs nothing. I have seen worse in India but for $ 240 for 2 nights even if it is NYC they can do much better!,wanderlust2hkv
UR118426774,2011-21-September,The first words out of the clerk's mouth were "the room doesn't have a bathroom". I believe that he says that if you look like you have any kind of class. Since the room is non-refundable they make money either way. We'd just come in from LA and didn't want to go looking for a room at night. So we get the key (when did you last see an actual hotel room key) and go up to our room (in the dingy elevator) with the intent of just staying the night. The hallways are really narrow and confusing. After finding the right hallway we went through a fire door. We were hit with an overpowering stench of urine. Holding our breaths the rest of the way we got to our door. Wait what's that on the door of the room next to us? It's a notice from the police not to enter the room. Must have been a murder committed there. We unlock the door and look upon a tiny room with a full side bed. It had a tv from the 60s might have been black and white. Sheets are stained window blind broken carpet dirty paint peeling and it smells. Didn't see any roaches or bedbugs but they were probably hiding. That was enough we fled the premises reported it to the BBB where they have an F rating (is that a surprise?). I took pictures before we left as we didn't think anyone would believe a hotel on the Westside could be this bad. Check them out and above all do not book a room there. I wouldn't board our dog there. We got a room at "On the Avenue" nearby. $10 less a night and a world of difference,Moe W
UR114566659,2011-20-June,I would advise not to go to this place. While it is relatively cheap and has a good location it is dirty to go to your room you have to go a long way with long solitary corridors and sometime you would see people just walking around that makes you wonder if they are also guests of the hotel or what...I am a female and went alone and did not feel safe at all. In addition the receptionists are not friendly. Also I still have bites from the bugs in the bed. I would consider spending a little bit more or going to a less expensive neighborhood.,mara039
UR118286345,2011-18-September,I been traveling all over the world from rich to poor and very poor countries and to be honest this was the worst ever. As soon as we get off from the taxi we saw the building and seems scary but you know could be just an old building but it wasn't just that. We went in to the reception and the guy didn't even say hi he just ask for the reservation. He gave us the key and the adventure starts. Is like 3 or 4 building all connected by a long and dirty corridor with 5 public phones cabin without the phone and all the cables out very dangeouros. Got into the elevator naaaaaaaaaaaaaasty smell awful we got off the elevator we took the left door ("S") and found our room but right in front of it was the toilet very small but that wouldn't be any problem it was unacceptable the shower full of hair reeeeaally dirty. I can keep writing more thing but honestly screw up my vacation. I have pictures about all this to proof it.,fefeq
UR108678372,2011-17-May,I booked this hotel for a friend and myself to stay in for 3 days. I booked the trip through Travelocity and thought I had found a real "steal" in the hotel as it was described. The only steal was my money because we left 15 minutes after we got there and they have refused to refund the money. It is by far the most disgusting hotel I have ever set foot in. I actually lived in a homeless shelter for 4 months and that was cleaner.,qwaide
UR115465088,2011-17-July,Not good folks. Bathroom is outside your room cleaners dump your clothes in the floor and the room is not too clean. Ahh I got what I paid for!,PaulMc7
UR118213229,2011-16-September,The pictures are truly deceptive. The hotel staff was rude and inconsiderate. This is one of the dirtiest hotels I have seen in my life! I booked this place through hotels.com after a verbal confirmation that I would have a private bath! After seeing the hotel and the shared bath; we were out in 10 minutes. We waited on the road while I worked out the refund with the staff at hotels.com. The only positive side to the place is it's location. And by the way it is NOT a cheap stay! One may rather stay on the streets! Thankfully we got our money back...from hotel.com; the hotel manager refused to even listen to our woes!,Niti6
UR116761146,2011-15-August,Smelly dingy and utterly uncomfortable. I BEGGED my children to take a shower in the shared bathroom. Our AC broke which was pinned into the window with boards the beds were rock hard and right when it couldn't get any worse we saw two roaches. I couldn't wait to leave...and neither could my children. If you're in and out and on an EXTREME budget (without children) this might work but save your NYC experience for another hotel if you can.,Amanda J
UR113000542,2011-13-June,There are a few things you might want to consider/ask yourself if you're thinking of staying here. Are you comfortable walking through a maze of doors and hallways that smell worse than a frat house after a night of binge drinking? Are you ok with taking a potentially temperature challenged shower every morning? Are you prepared to be-friend bed bugs? They have a 'no refund policy' which should have been the first clue buyer beware. However at $100/night for a room in Manhattan it's easy (at first) to forgive a dark dingy room that smells like a combination of vomit and air freshener combined. I understand that hostel living means that you have to walk down the hall to a bathroom but I didn't expect to find filthy bathrooms with roaches and trash on the floor. While there are multiple bathrooms per floor be prepared to wait for a long while if the "good bathroom" is in use. Also make sure you're ok with taking either scalding hot shower or numbingly cold one as the shower handles in almost every shower I used is incredibly finicky. If you're still thinking that this hotel is a deal and that you're only going to be sleeping there for a few nights you should also know that I stayed there over 2 weeks ago and I still have over 20 bed bug bites that are miserably itchy. My advice to you if you're searching for a great deal do a little more research online and find a room rent option instead.,geminixyn
UR116682843,2011-13-August,I'm from Florida and have never been to ny. From the outside I was excited to stay there we walked in and I thought I was in a horror movie. It literally smelled like murder and hookers. The elevator was a joke and the hallways were disgusting and scary. 5 seconds of being in the room we saw 2 roaches. I've never seen anything like it. My friends and I were laughing histerically as we sat in the room looking for another hotel then left the key and walked out the front door. Don't bring children here. If you're looking for a new york experience you'll never forget check this place out. But don't stay!!!,Alexandrarob
UR96355264,2011-12-February,This is by far the worst hotel Ive ever stayed in and Ive stayed in a lot of low budget places before since I dont like to spend that much money on accomondation. From the outside the hotel or hostel looks nice but when you enter its very worn down . The rooms are filthy sheets are durty beds are uncomfortable and my mettras was full with BEDBUGS!! The second night I got bitten all over my body. I went down to the reception showed the strange guy (receptionist) my bitemarks. He said that they had a problem with bedbugs and that we could change to a different room. We change rooms but I had problems sleeping cause my body was itching like crazy. We wanted to leave the horrible place but couldnt get a refund cause the room was already prepaid. We ended up stayed in the hotel for 4 nights then chose a different hotel for our last 2 night in NYC. The crap hotel ruined our vacation. I suggest you choose a different hotel.,gl0betr0ttern
UR119164290,2011-10-October,I want to preface this review with a note that I am a student and very unfussy person. I stay in hostels a lot (shared rooms with bunks shared bathrooms) so am used to "roughing it" a fair bit. I really try to give fair reviews on Tripadvisor. Hotel Riverside Studios is the most disgusting place I have ever stayed. Someone described the lobby as resembling a "crack house" and I would agree with this. The hallways are mouldy carpets peeling wires hanging everywhere. The general state of cleanliness is well below par. The entire hotel is dusty dirty and smelly. The room my friend had booked was a double for two. The bedsheets were stained the carpets were dirty I saw a huge cockroach scuttle along the floor and couldn't even tell my friend because she'd rather sleep on the subway than stay in a room with creepy-crawlies. The shared bathrooms were VILE. What looked like oil stains all over the bath the toilet blocked I actually felt gross using the water to brush my teeth. The worst moment of all was coming home after a night out and seeing a huge RAT run along the entrance to the hotel. It sounds like I'm making this up but I in no way am. Now that my friend and I are away from the dump that is Hotel Riverside Studios we can laugh about it but it kind of ruined our trip. We wanted to spend no time in the place at all and after a day in NYC sometimes all you want is a nice shower and bed. DO NOT STAY HERE! The website tricks you with nice pictures but it's a lie. Once you book your booking is non-refundable so they have you trapped. Don't stay here! Sleep under a bridge I guarantee it would be better!,maeveobrien
UR60720069,2010-8-April,We decided to save our money for the experience of New York so were reasonably pleased to pay 550 each for flights from Heathrow and 5 nights accommodation. Wow- were we ripped off!!! The location is great- very close to Columbus Circle and Central Park. However the hotel was disgusting- we found two cockroaches and it always stank of smelly food! I really don't know how this hotel got the one and half stars that it has been awarded. Try avoid this hotel at all costs. We did not spend much time in our room as we were out and about all day but this is the kind of room you definitely don't want to go back to after a long day of sight-seeing. After a fantastic trip to the Big Apple our accommodation was by far our biggest low light!,LondonSunsearcher
UR52825878,2010-7-January,THE "BEST" is the situation in the middle of Manhantan and very near of metro stations supermarkets fashion street banks... and the staff friendly and accesible. THE WORST: too much things. Begs in the bedroom windows that seem theres no window (so very cold and very noisy inside) and no courtains so you wake up very early in the morning. Old bathrooms (with broken tiles near the basin) old corridors stairs and elevators (in fact one of them didnt work the day of my arrival so i had to change my room). THE PRICE: about 412$ for 5 days the first week of Dec. Cheap for NY but if you can find something better dont hesitate. CLUE: find out and book with anticipation this will be the best to find a good hotel.,Ulisestgo
UR73951388,2010-5-August,First thing is first it looks spacious in the photographs. However it's not as big as you think. The room I stayed in had the basics: a bed pillows blankets and sheets a closet with hangers television small refrigerator a lamp some drawers a chair and air conditioning/heater. You also get a sink with a medicine cabinet in your own room! However it doesn't come with a bathroom. Your bathroom situation in this hotel is communal. The bathrooms on my floor needed some work. Maybe a lot of work. The bathroom with a tub has a problem with privacy. The shower curtain for the shower/tub doesn't completely block yourself from the person across the building from you. If anything the windows are somehow strategically placed to show more of yourself to the adjacent building than you want. The toilets are a bit tricky to flush and you would have to push on the lever completely down if you want any work done. The floors get wet really fast from the leaking pipes of the sinks and toilets. Things I wish I brought: -a roll of toilet paper -hand and body soap -my own towels -flip flops for the bathroom -shower caddy -bathroom robe This particular living situation reminds me of a college dorm room because of how you have to share some common space with complete strangers. I only stayed for 3 nights and 3 days and this room definitely made me want to stay out on the town more than anything else. Good thing I only stayed a few days because I don't think I could handle more. This room is great because it forces you to stay away from it.,cecacat
UR77313243,2010-29-August,We knew what we were getting to when we booked this place. It was the only place throughout our travels where we had to stay somewhere without an ensuite bathroom. New york was just too expensive nowhere else was affordable. So i knew that I was getting nothing for my money. I was almost pleasantly surprised to see that the room was clean enough although I wore flip flops all the time as the floor was questionable. But as long as the bed was clean I didn't mind. The sink was also fairly clean. However the communal bathrooms/showers were pretty grim. I also wore my flip flops the whole time in there including in the shower and just basically tried not to touch the sides. I struggled to get the water to heat up as well which was an issue but it eventually got to a bearable temperature. The bed was uncomfortable and springy and service was nothing special. They checked us in and out and that was about it. The metro was fairly nearby but I wouldn't have liked to have had to walk around on my own at night in this area. Overall this was a bearable stay but I wouldn't stay again if I had the choice.,Michelle444

UR76838396,2010-25-August,do not stay there!! Bathroom is gross  rooms are small .This place is a dump there is no security at all .This is the worse hotel i've ever stepped in.,eliah3
UR59275121,2010-22-March,Do NOT stay at this "hotel" EVER! Spend the extra money on a nicer hotel. It is worth it! I have never felt SO disgusted in my entire life. This can hardly be considered a hotel... more like a bad hostel. Don't let the location of this place fool you. It may be in a really nice neighborhood but it is DIRTY!!!!! We found two large bed bugs in one of the bed and now I have insanely itchy bites all over my body. STAY AWAY!!!,MNinNYC
UR80440184,2010-21-September,Old not very clean bathrooms . Would not stay there again.,mikinbin

UR69475552,2010-2-July,The room is very small has bare white walls no pictures mirrors nothing. Carpet is dirty and worn. The bed is small and hard. The room has a small sink and small table that' it. You have to bring a roll of toilet paper into the bathroom with you. The shared bathoom is very small and has an open window with no screen in it. Outside the bathroom window is a mess. The halls in this "hotel" are nerrow have bare white dirty walls and dirty worn carpet.,Kathy36518
UR80220646,2010-19-September,Dear fellow travelers dont believe the name of this accomodation its not a hotel! The state of the rooms the bathrooms restrooms and the dirtiness just reminds me of one of my former student homes and thats not a positive memory! I dont expect the quality of the Hilton for that price in NYC but what I do expect when I book a hotel is clean rooms clean sanitary and I want to feel safe. Thats all not available at Hotel Riverside Studios. The only good thing is the location.,cornie53

UR61950252,2010-19-April,My partner and I had been staying in another New York hotel on holiday when our flight was cancelled due to the volcanic ash from Iceland. We needed cheaper accommodation than we had and the Hotel Riverside Studios was fairly close by and looked clean and was very reasonably priced. I had not read the reviews as we were in a hurry to get somewhere at a cheaper price. Initially this hotel looked better than I expected but it became clear that first impressions were deceptive. The room we had (a double) was absolutely freezing due to the fact that the shutters on either side of the air-conditioning unit which is fitted underneath the window did not shut completely so the window is effectively open all the time. I told the man on reception who looked at me like this was one in a long line of hassles he could live without and then showed me how the radiator worked although the radiator he said only works when the temperature drops sufficiently outside. He went and got us an extra blanket somewhat grudgingly but it didn't really help. The radiator finally came on at about 1 am I know not because the room flooded with warmth but because the hissing steam that came whooshing out the side valve woke me up and it was impossible to stop it. I would not recommend staying here with children because the radiator and the valves heat up to the point of scalding. The radiator went off after about an hour and the room was freezing again by the morning. The rest of the room was just depressing. The window looks onto an alley so it is very dark there are no curtains just some broken old blind. The bed is horrendously hard and there are no chairs to sit in. The only advantage is the sink which means you can spend less time in the bathrooms and on that note - The bathrooms are grim. I realise that sharing with strangers is never going to be the ideal situation but the bathroom facilities are just inherently dirty. The fixtures are broken the shower curtains are old and on occassion cling to you (very unpleasant). The floors are tiled and there are no bath mats or paper for cleaning the floor so the floor is always wet and dirty. There is a cleaner but I had to remove someone else's hair from the plug because the shower filled up when I used it. To top off this delightful experience one of the bathroom windows which is next to the shower is wedged open and appears to look on to a wall and a window which looks like it has been pasted over. It is not possible to pull the curtain in front of the window so I assumed I was safe to use it undisturbed. Not so! Half way through my shower on the second day I looked down to see I had an audience of one watching me in the shower lovely. The rest of the hotel is very run down and smells odd. I wasn't expecting luxury but it infuriates me that someone makes money out of this level of service.,PicklesMcGraw
UR67890355,2010-18-June,this is the most disgusting hovel i have ever stayed in we booked 3 nights but only stayed one and this was because all others were fully booked. it is absolutely filthy with windows that dont shut and electrical wires sticking out of the walls. please please dont stay here it will ruin your holiday.,lethba
UR87329764,2010-16-November,This Hotel was filthy the service was horrible and someone tried to break down our door. There is no security here whatsoever doors and hallway windows are left open and fireprotection is poor!!! There is only one puny lock on the door! When they tried to kick in our door I could see the light from the hallway!!!!!Don't at all costs do not stay here!!!,Mandiva333
UR87080037,2010-14-November,This was not my accommodation choice but I ended up staying here after a double booking elsewhere. Location is extremely handy for a lot of things and this is the redeeming feature of this place. Bedding and towels are clean and changed daily and I accumulated a lifetime's supply of soap and toilet paper in just a few days. TV & fridge a bonus. Bathroom evidently cleaned daily. No sign of bedbugs in my room. However the entire place is looking very shabby (unlike the pics online) and in need of a lick of paint and steam cleaning of the carpets at the very least. However if you are on a budget and want central Manhatten accommodation worth considering!,Paulskii
UR40411683,2009-9-September,this place is falling apart the rooms stink my room had punched in walls a windows covered by a plank of wood toilets and bathroms were filthy and we jus chose to shower on the last day thats how flthy they were wernt cleaned in 4 days...all bathrooms are shared website advrties wrongly...i acutally cried thats how bad it was... most hostels are better...it a illegal hotel meant for public renting and has WORKING MALE PROSTITUES staying there no joke...only good thing its in a nice safe area!!!!!,bull1345
UR50830130,2009-7-December,The sight of a run down lobby and bad smell did not fill me with confidence as I entered the Hotel Riverside Studios and as for the name it is indeed by the river right on the edge of the river but this does not make for a good view or good area. After a long and confusing walk around the hotel to our first room we were greeted by cockroaches leaping around as soon as we opened the door. This quickly led to us getting our second room which was on the seventh floor  which was a pain because the lift was not something you wanted to risk using. The carpets all had stains and the buzzing from the fridges and clunking of the plumbing went on all night. As soon as we could the next day we escaped to a better hotel after an awful nights sleep not sure what was moving at the end of the bed. The smell of the hotel remained in my clothes until I washed them. Do not stay here ever there is a reason why they always have vacancies.,kprior
UR39953436,2009-6-September,I have just returned from a visit to NYC after staying at Hotel Riverside Studios. If you are fussy about staying in a clean environment do not stay here. My profession means I travel a lot and I am used to very cheap hotels yet I haven't come across anything like this before. The room itself was big. Two double beds. An attempt at giving the room a cheerful feel with bright bedcovers was immediately undone by the massively uncomfortable mattress and wheels that meant the bed moved! I didn't dare sleeping under the covers luckily it was very warm during our visit. Talking of warm let me tell you about the air-con. It's a window unit that makes an ungodly sound and only when stood directly in front could the effects be felt but it did give small relief. The room didn't feel like it had ever had a proper clean. I wore socks or flip-flops when I was in the room as the carpet had visible stains. The sink was disgusting practically orange with rust and scaly taps that have long lost their sheen. There was a decent tv in the room which drowned out exterior noise - I often heard doors slamming during the night. The ceiling also had a lovely damp patch right above where I was sleeping a charming sight to drop off to. Now the bathrooms. I've seen reviews on this site complaining about the shared bathrooms frankly this is an oversight and complaining in unjustified. Complaining about the state of said shared bathrooms is totally justified - they were foul. I don't mean dated or aged I mean filthy. The bath looked like it hadn't been scrubbed for months disgraceful. Wear flip-flops sandals crocks and preferably a gas mask at all times. I had read reviews of rats and cockroaches so was dreading my visit. Luckily I did not come across any but I had my eyes open the whole time and I wouldn't have been surprised if I had. I believe the building also houses permanent residents so expect surly looking old men shuffling around casting evil looks in your direction. The one good point about this place is its location. It's a lovely neighbourhood near great restaurants and bars (Cafe Luxembourg Citrus 'Cesca....etc etc) and only about 15-20 minute walk from Times Square. Close to a subway station (72nd and Broadway) and a quick walk west takes you to a beautiful view of the Hudson. We were unlucky - expedia messed up our booking and we had to be moved last minute. I will be requesting a refund. All that said we had a wonderful trip and the hotel was a minor blip but for the price there are better places to stay. I have been as truthful as possible in this review and would not recommend it to anyone and I hope you have read some of these reviews before booking!,sheissuffering
UR31173731,2009-30-May,THIS PLACE IS REALLY SCUZZY!!!! If you don't mind the LOWEST of CLASS then go ahead this is the place for you. The walls doors and floors are paper thin a piece of cardboard is thicker than the bed pillows were the TV half assed worked there were no utensils to rinse your mouth out with in the crummy (shared) bathroom when brushing your teeth. The rooms are hot no air conditioning the coke machine was broke everything seemed broke (and mind you there is nowhere within a block or two to get a drink) so you better come prepared. This place is old and non-renovated smells bad and reeks of disease. I find it borderline desciptive to run a facility like this to guests from out of town who unknowingly have no clue what this dump is really like until they get there after they've booked and paid (nonrefundable) for 2 3 nights then find out . The front entrance is okay you cannot tell what a dive it is until walking down its hallways. It also bothered me when I saw so many other unhappy guests. If the FDA allows the operation of this hotel then it is only passing standards by the skin of its teeth. The staff must hate their jobs with SO many constant complaints and unhappy guests and I can't even imagine what the owner is like. I was stuck there 3 nights and the thought of returning to the room nauseated me. The ambiance nearly ruined my first time visit to NYC. PAY A LITTLE MORE IT'LL BE WORTH IT. READ OTHER REVIEWS OF OTHER HOTELS WITH BETTER RATINGS. BELIEVE ME NOT ALL PEOPLE WHO'VE RATED THIS HOTEL ARE LYING.,sallyjb88
UR31477937,2009-3-June,The previous reviewer stated that her and some college friends stayed here....well.... if you are more "mature" in your years and have settled for these type of accommodations in the past don't settle for this "dump" now! We have stayed in older hotels in NYC before and the rooms were adequate but this place.... Something should have told me to run when I saw an elderly gentleman shuffling his way through the hallway with a cigarette hanging from his mouth heading to a telephone booth in the hall. When we arrived at our room we said okay let's see what is behind door number 2. Once we opened the door to our surprise we saw our own personal roll of toilet paper resting on a bed with a mattress shaped like a half-moon. Immediately I had a flashback to my days when I was in the military sleep in the "field". There was a small sink tucked in the corner and my wife asked where is the bathroom? Well folks the bathroom is located down the hall and around the corner. You get to SHARE the shower and toilet with the entire floor. Oh and by no means is this an inviting bathroom. If you want to be able to get as good night sleep I would STRONGLY suggest that you stay elsewhere. This review is not a knock on the courteous lady at the counter who greeted us.

UR50267156,2009-29-November,You know that saying "You get what you pay for?" It's really true here. There's a reason this place is so cheap. I've stayed at hostels that were much nicer. The good: PRICE - you won't find places this close to the action in Manhattan for so little money. LOCATION is great. The neighborhood is beautiful and very quiet - street full of old brownstones. Very safe. The subway is 2 short blocks away at 72nd st. and Amsterdam Ave. There are stores and restaurants nearby although we didn't partake in any of them. Hop on the subway and Times Square is 3 stops away. Central Park is 4 blocks walk. AMMENITIES: wash basin in room (nice for washing hands brushing teeth); Refrigerator was new and worked very well. Sorry - that's it for the "good" stuff. Now on to the bad...... BATHROOMS: Where to start? No heat; bugs; exposed wiring hanging out from walls (up high); cracked tiles; tubs desperately in need of reglazing (cracked porcelain etc.); only the rim of the washbasin for setting your things down (you really have no option but to set your things on the toilet cover or the floor); a couple of hooks for hanging things but they are up very high which is fine if you happen to be tall. The light which stays on 24/7 is behind you when facing the mirror (not great for applying makeup; bring your own mirror). We stayed on the 3rd floor at the back (3A8). There was a bathroom right next to our room. There was another one around the corner from us and another up the corridor toward the elevator. All three were similar to the description above. The one around the corner had a non-flushing toilet. The one up the corridor was tiny and had a nasty drain in the middle of the floor with bugs crawling out of it. We used the one closest to us. The door handle on the door to "our" bathroom was broken. You could pull the handle in/out through the hole. In order to close the door you had to pull the whole thing toward you until the knob couldn't go any further on the outside of the door then you locked the door with a sliding bolt. That worked fine until on the second night somebody else used the bathroom and broke the door handle entirely. We found pieces of it sitting on the floor. Now the only way to close the door was to have somebody push it closed from the outside because the hole for the doorknob was too small to grab onto from inside the room. The doorknob remained broken and on the floor for an entire 24 hour period until we checked out. Also you are given a roll of toilet paper when you check in. You have to remember to bring it with you to the bathroom or just leave it in there (but there is no where to set it near the toilet so you'd have to either balance it on the edge of the tub or set it on the floor). Yuck. The shower worked fine. The water pressure was great and there was plenty of hot water even first thing in the morning. It was a bit squicky standing on the rough surface inside the tub but it's perfectly functional - just cosmetically ugly. THE ROOM: We had a large room with 2 double beds. These had to be the most uncomfortable squeaky beds I've ever slept in and I've travelled extensively. You could hardly breathe without hearing the bed squeak. There were no plastic mattress covers on either of our beds. I did check for bedbugs and found nothing. Each bed had two very flat flimsy pillows. There was a flat sheet on the bottom that needed to be re-tucked often. There is a flat sheet velour blanket and NASTY bedspread on top. I don't know if it was just the design but that thing looked like it hasn't been washed in a couple of decades. We peeled off the bedspread rather than risk touching it. There is a nightstand between the beds with a clock radio a phone and a lamp. I can't comment on the functionality of the clock radio because I unplugged it in order to use the electrical outlet behind the bed for my phone charger. There is an armoire with a TV that works but only gets a few stations like TBS and some local channels but no Weather Channel cable news channels or anything similiarly useful. The TV remote does not work. There are two upholstered swiveling chairs but no table that you could use to eat or set your things on. There is an old cast iron radiator for heat. I could never manage to get the temperature right in our room. The first night the weather was mild outdoors and we roasted in the room. The second and third nights the weather had turned cooler and much windier. We froze. The windows are old and leak lots of air. There is no insulation in the walls. If the forecast for your stay is "cold and windy" bring your flannel pajamas and extra blankets. I slept in my polartec jacket and gloves the last night and was fine then. There are no grounded electrical outlets. There were only two outlets (except for the one that served the refrigerator and the television together) that worked. I brought along a power strip but was unable to use it because it is grounded and wouldn't fit the plug. There is no mirror in the room. There is a closet with one hanger. There are mini-blinds over the windows but no curtains to help keep it warm or dark inside. There is a very tiny waste bin under the sink. The carpeting is fairly industrial looking but seemed clean in our room. The hallways on the other hand were dodgy. There was trash set out - left by guests for pickup by the housekeeping staff and lots of paint flakes and debris. It looked like the corridors hadn't been vacuumed in a while. That's it for the description. We also had one rather strange thing happen while we were there. Our first night was Thanksgiving Eve. We went to bed early because we had to get up early for the parade the next morning. At about 12:30am we were all awakened by the sound of someone walking around in the room above us. That went on for about 30 minutes. Then just after 1am the person started VACUUMING the room. The vacuuming went on for 45 minutes. I am not kidding. I must have checked my clock about 47 times during this ordeal. Finally at 1:52am I decided I had enough and went down to the lobby to complain. The desk attendant told me the room above was vacant that night. I responded by saying "well either you've got the next Texas Chainsaw Massacre going on up there or a vacuuming ghost." He promised to check it out. The vacumming stopped 10 minutes later. We were supposed to be checking out today but we left a day early because we were all cold and miserable and didn't want another night of discomfort.,jonesinmybones
UR50154876,2009-27-November,When I booked the hotel for $85 on Thanksgiving eve I thought it was inexpensive but how bad could it be? Well.. Peeling paint and plaster rotted bathtubs (you can't shower here it's too disgusting) no battery in smoke detector bugs in bathroom no chain lock (missing) paper thin pillows with plastic sheet underneath linen dirty and ripped carpets. Pay the extra money and go elsewhere. Cheap room is not a value.,chaenny
UR28770411,2009-25-April,We were looking for a simple hotel for a week for a reasonable price. For us it was OK that we had to share restroom and shower with other guests on our floor and generally speaking the rooms appeared clean. However we did have a few surprises: The shower closest to our room did not work for a couple of days some guests were loud in the middle of the night we could not control the temperature of our room and one day our room was not serviced. Worse however were the two bed bugs we have found the morning we left whose bites we still felt a week later and how the guy at the reception reacted when I mentioned the bed bugs during check-out: He did not respond at all. Thus I am sure they did not take care of possible additional bugs after we left...,Wilfred95
UR30661201,2009-24-May,the hotel is in need of updating also there is a smell of wee on the ground floor from the last room near the telephones very disgusting. The rooms are too hot and the air con too noisy the bathrooms are dirty and smell very bad also the carpet is very worn and sticky. The bed creeked. the rooms where in need of a clean and a paint. Many older people live here and they leave a smell when they move around to the bathrooms. If you like the above and enjoy the smell of wee then go for it !!!,heidimill
UR30581861,2009-23-May,See...I had to stay in New York for two-three days..and I needed to find accomodation..I searched for a lot of hotels..but none were near this mark..The website and the reviews showed that this place was pretty good and looking at that it seemed that this was a great deal for $100...but the moment i arrived at this hotel..i was in for a shock....It seemed like a place for weirdos and mentals...First thing It took 15 minutes to find the elevator and by the time the smell of that place was already making me faint...when i finally found the elevator...it was even more frightful..the elevator was definitely 40 years old and i just couldnt keep up with the thought of going to the third floor...the third floor had the markings written with a scratching on the wall using a nail...thats how you had to identify it...I was lucky enough though on the attached bathroom stuff...because It was straight opposite to my room.....the 2nd day however...i found shaven hairs on the closet...the 3rd day..the hot water tap was beggining to run loose and looked like breaking off any moment..i tried the other bathrooms..but they were far worse...with a temp of -12c and in danger of steam burns at the same time...it was a nice paradox though...but what one get for a $100 accomodation..I think we need to definitely get what we have paid for and what the hotel promised to do.....,siddharthnaidu
UR28402255,2009-20-April,The location on 71st Street West is great. It's only a 2 minute walk to the subway and you can coast all the way to mid- and down-town. The area is residential and quiet so you don't have honking cars loud traffic or throngs of people and the west riverside front is nice to see. We booked 1 room with 2 twin beds. The man on the front desk gave us a choice of the 2nd or 7th floor. I asked which was was better and he said the 2nd floor hallway had a funny smell. The 7th floor was a [--] to get to because of the slow old-school elevator. The room was relatively clean. There were no bed bugs but I did see 1 or two imbedded stains on the clean towels and a random hair on the sheet that seemed to have been knotted during the laundry process. The room included a tiny fridge and a tv. The fridge worked but I don't know about the TV since I didn't turn it on. It had a windw AC and heating unit. The room also came with two large towels 1 hand towel and 1 roll of bathroom tissue for each guest. The bathroom was disgusting. I don't think the cleaners cleaned it more than 1 every other day. I couldn't tell. It just wasn't clean. I hated it and felt diseased when I left. Nasties included skid marks on the toilet crusties on the bath tub and shower installs soap residue on the holders snot or something on the sing bowl. Very icky. The floor was also brown/black with dirt.,YoBrown
UR45693960,2009-2-October,They should pay you for staying there. My first impression was that they didn't change anything there for 40 years. They have shared bathroom not very clean. Room is very small. There are holes in stained sheets. Naked bulbs. No internet access. Tv has a 5 channels all of them has some disturbance so you can't really watch it. And I found two mouses in my room and insects. I received 10% discount from the manager.,pinang
UR48355718,2009-2-November,I cannot review the quality of the hotel but simply my experience dealing with them. I decided to make a last minute trip to NYC this weekend and got a red eye friday night flight with a sunday return. I booked the hotel and purchased theater tickets. Unfortunately my flight got cancelled due to plane malfunctions and the next flight was not till Sunday. Since it was just a weekend trip that was not an option. Despite an official policy that says no refunds ALL three of the theater tickets were refunded as they understood my situation and that it was out of my control. Hotel Riverside Studios however refused to refund me. I called them immediately (Friday night) to tell them I would not be able to make it because my flight had been cancelled. They cancelled the booking but said they could not issue a refund without approval from the hotel manager. For the record I had to call the hotel five times over three days before the manager was there and could deny my refund. Everytime I was told to call back at another time and he would then be there. He never was. So apparently the hotel manager is NEVER there. Furthermore I can understand them perhaps not refunding me if the room was left vacant but I decided to check and so I called their reservations number on Saturday afternoon (I was supposed to stay there just Saturday night) to inquire about the availability of a private room (which my booking was) and was told that they had no availability. So effectively they rebooked my room but still would not refund me. I understand their policies but since it was easy to verify my flight had been cancelled and they managed to rebook the room I do not understand why they could not refund me (as everyone else had done DESPITE their policies). The hotel may be a great place to stay but I can guarantee I will never book a room there again. Judging by the way I was treated hospitality is clearly not their forte.,tatanaz
UR38154089,2009-19-August,I should have listened to reviews it was the cheapest "hotel" so I guess I should have expected it. The girl that checked me in was very rude and dismissive there were mice in the hall disgusting! I was told they couldn't do anything until the morning thankfully I'm not squemish about mice but it was still disgusting! Narrow dirty hallways too. They wouldn't even post a letter for me!,travelman99ie
UR42639896,2009-18-September,It looked loke sometihng you can see in a horror movie. We have seen it all: Ants mice and cockroaches. The location is great but the house is crap. The standard is awful and bathrooms/toilets are crappy. Owners would need to invest in it properly. I am happy we managed to keep our stuff as the room keys looked like something we used 30-40 years ago. I am going to upload a video of the place on youtube soon so search for it.,Sakala
UR32355203,2009-15-June,People at the desk were supportive even if they were not so friendly at the phone. It was rather a hostel than a hotel. The single room wasn't small but it was in quite bad conditions with very poor furniture. No bugs in the bed but the synthetic nature of mattress and pillow combined with sheets and pillow case caused the bed to be squeaky sweaty and sticky not comfortable anyway. I stayed in the hotel just the time to sleep and shower. A clean fridge was available for my use in the room. Toilets and showers were available in the corridor and they were cleaned rather often. The location was fantastic 1 block away from the subway (5min walk line 1-2-3) in a quiet and safe residential area. Upper West is the best to visit Manhattan. Good low-budget sleep-and-go accommodation in NY. Bad looking and uncomfortable hotel room and bed.,FantedeSpade
UR51310455,2009-15-December,This hotel was awful. I couldn't bear to pay $400 for all the other hotels in Manhattan however after seeing our room and the shared bathroom in the hall we left. The hotel was non-refundable so we wasted our money on this hotel while spending the money for another hotel. The bed was small and not big enough to fit 2 people comfortably while there was no heat and even if there was the window was broke so all the heat would have gone outside. Spend the extra money for a nicer place.,jmutz7
UR37393936,2009-11-August,We got woken up by some noise it was rodent eating our food! Place is a disaster bathrooms are totally disgusting. We preferred not to shower then use their facilities. Location is good if you like hostel like accommodation except that you will pay four times more then for the hostel. If you decide to rent it check the room and bath first - you will look for something else! WORST hotel EVER!!!,lqql
UR18705843,2008-7-August,My boyfriend and I had booked for 5 nights here. When we walked in were totally disgusted by the place- I have stayed in $10 a night Hostels that are cleaner than this. Unfortunately we had paid for 5 nights up front ( a mistake I will not make again) so we would lose a portion of our money if we left. We decided to bear with it thinking that we would only be here to sleep but after the second night we had to leave after waking up covered in bed bug bites. The worst thing was when we went downstairs to tell them we were checking out and wanted our money refunded the desk clerk was not the least bit surprised!! I would not recommend this hotel to my worst enemy. I am no princess and have stayed and lived in some absolute hovels during my 4 years of travel and this is the first time I have felt compelled to write a review about anywhere. I would strongly advise if people are looking for somewhere cheap to stay in New York- Do Not Stay Here!! Look for a Hostel instead. I have stayed in many cheap Hostels in New York and they have all been 100 times better than this place.,laurenjane79
UR12379446,2008-6-January,We stayed at his hotel for one night in november 2007.All the other hotels were booked for that night. This hotel(if we can call it an hotel??!!)is the most DISCUSTING DIRTY NOISY UNPLEASANT SCARY HORRIBLE SERVICE UNCONFORTABLE HOTEL we have ever experienced in our life. We are not picky travellers we travel a lot and in a very simple and cheap way. But for the price you pay seriously that place is a real JOKE. It looks ok from the outside.But from the inside....It is another story. There was one bathroom and very small and sooooo dirty for ALL the rooms on our floor!!! That means one bathroom for around 15 rooms!!!! FOR YOUR OWN GOOD STAY AT A YOUTH HOSTEL if you are looking for something cheap. AND DON'T GO THERE if you wanna enjoy your trip to New-York city!!,spoofu
UR19578385,2008-31-August,I stayed there for 4 nigth. The only really nice thing about this hotel is the neigborhood. It<s 5minutes to 72th station metro and the area is really quiet full of restaurant and accomodation like grocery stores and cafe. Talk about the hotel now... It was really stain on the wall full of cracks and the carpet in the room was dirty. I wasn't even sure if they clean the bedsheat. There were dirt on the bedhead and the shared bathroom hadn't been clean for at least 3 days. The last day of my trip I found a cockroach on the desk beside my bed and when we advise the clerk they just said: I'm sorry. If you want to pay a cheap hotel I would strongly recommend you to check for the YMCA before this. If you keep your luggage close and want a place to sleep only and if cockroach don't rebute youthen you can go there. Have a nice trip!,MIew
UR15622606,2008-3-May,This was a head splitting nightmare!!! This was my first trip to NY and I doubt that I will be back any time soon!! I found this hotel on hotels.com and recieved a very good price. Upon arrival I was patting myself on the back..thinking I did a pretty good job choosing a hotel for a city that I have never been to! That little pat on the back ended as soon as we stepped through the doors. The service was not only a joke but the accomadations nearly gave me an ulcer! The carpet smelled of urine and had fleas. Our room did not have a bathroom. Instead we had to share a bathroom with everyone else on our floor. Granted this is my first time here however don't most hotels offer bathrooms for each room??? The one toliet that we had to use was covered with urine stains as well as the floors. There were also a few pubic hairs for garnish on the seat! This establishment is not fit for even wild animals much less human beings and their young. I do not recommend ANYONE paying for someones absurd idea of a hotel!,joejoejoe321321
UR19235777,2008-22-August,This place is a real dumppppppp Went there with my girlfriend to stay for 3 nights It was a real anarchy First the front desk had no personality! Who hires these people no greeting what so ever and also no such help with luggage the handyman was dirty and kept complaining about some job he did there and for some reason was checkin my girl out and also the place stinked They didnt service our room for 3 nights and I spoke to someone but no one cared and I wanted to approach the manager but I see he didnt give a damn as much as I saw no one worked here Its just a big scamm people (even motel 6 its not like these as these people dont know the first thing about Hotel Business so do yourself a favor and go somewere else as I found out from front desk there is plenty other hotels in the area who actually give a damn about what they are doing. GOOD DAY WISH YOU THE BEST FELLOW TRAVELERS,WALKER_NJ
UR21483472,2008-2-November,I recently stayed at Hotel Riverside 342 West 71st Street New York. It wasn't the most pleasant of stays. I was staying there with my best friend and she also was not impressed. We had a room with two single beds the room really smelt the window in the room would not even open. There was no air conditioning in the room(which it states on thier web site). We had to share bathrooms which is ok but not when they are dirty and have cockroaches in them. We had a wardrobe but with no coat hangers also the room didn't even have a mirror. The hotel was also supposed to be non-smoking so why were there people staying smoking with thier doors open. But apart from that the location is great close to restaurants and four blocks from Central Park two blocks from the subway. Also it only takes about thirty minutes to get down town. All in all it was quite expensive for what it was.,ENGLANDLISA_8
UR15080579,2008-16-April,When you travel to New York you have recognize that real world money rules don't apply. Everything is outrageously expensive so it's all relative. So relatively speaking this is a nice option for someone wanting the bare basics in a nice quiet part of Manhattan. How nice an area? Well John Lennon's apartment in The Dakota is one street over So what do you get? In order importance you get a bed sink 22" TV (with Cable) towels soap one roll of toilet paper nightstand dresser lamp clock phone and stool. That's it. You don't realize how stark it is until you open the door. No funky artwork no fashion color walls only a beige color. But everything was very clean. All there and it reminded me a dorm room and that's who it seems a large part of the quests that stayed there were. Everyone was quiet and well mannered but the walls are a bit thin but only 50% of the rooms seemed filled in this week so it wasn't a problem. Of course everyone asks about the bathroom. There were 2 for about 10 rooms. Never saw anyone but there was always one open when I needed it. It was very clean as well but one was very small the other a bit larger. So..would I stay again? I probably would. If you are on a budget an entrepreneur paying your own tab and are up for an experience by all means do it. If you are looking for a $85 Hampton Inn or Courtyard those are 3 times as much..and this isn't it.,Microtek1
UR20811095,2008-11-October,When I walked into this dump I immediately recognized it from an episode of Law & Order SVU. It truly looks like one of those hotels that would end up in a show about killers and rapists. It was awful. Half the deadbolt was missing the mattresses were covered in plastic there was no water in the shower and the sign for the elevator was written on a US Postal Service label. The front desk people were unfriendly and dirty as was the hotel. The shared bathroom had a sink that was falling out of the wall. Scary!!!!! We actually ended up staying out as late as possible to avoid sleeping here. Let's just say this place will never see me again.,katusaAtlanta_GA
UR20540052,2008-1-October,Location was great: No. 5 bus a couple of minutes walk away. 72nd street subway 5 mins walk. Diners & restaurants close by. Easy to get to all the top locations. Quiet residential area. Seemed to be a very safe neighbourhood. Room was basic. Clean linen every day. Carpet was dirty. Bathroom & shower very close to my room and were seldom in use when I wanted them. Shower was old but clean. But toilet didn't get cleaned for the 3 nights I was there - this was not acceptable at all. I didn't spend any time in the room apart from sleeping so it is just as well!! So if you plan to be out all day & don't want to spend much money (by NY standards) and are willing to cross your fingers to hope the toilet has been cleaned this is the place for you!,visitor009
UR17421344,2008-1-July,After reading all the mixed reviews of this place me and my sister were a little wary of staying here. For the price its great a nice neighborhood and quick walk to the 72nd and Broadways station. When we first checked in we were told to go to the "elevator" at the end of the hallway. After walking around we finally noticed what looked like a closet door with elevator buttons on the outside. This was the elevator. Our room looked pretty decent and was exactly as it had been described by other travelers as a dorm room. The shared bathroom was right next to our room. However my sister noticed a pubic hair on the "clean" towel that was supplied in our room the bathtub was disgusting and I showered in my flip flops. There was rust on the drain and all we got was a bar of soap and one towel and washcloth. If you are looking for something in a nice quiet neighborhood quick walk to the subway and a great little cafe on the corner this is your place. If you're looking for paper thin walls a shared bathroom and hard beds this is also your place. It was good for a weekend stay but not quite worth the 133 bucks we paid for an overnight stay.,GeorgiaGal1216
UR11411561,2007-9-December,People thinking that this this is a bargain are wrong. It's reasonably priced for Manahttan but: -Heaps of noise thanks to drunks and thin walls and floors -Tiny rooms you have to go outside to change your mind... -Share 1 dirty shower and toilet on 10 rooms! -No internet available -Worst service ever as in: NO service -Rubbish bins in the hallway; they're being emptied at 3am with heaps of noise -Small and short beds -Some (female) friends had the reception guy in their room at 2am (no knocking) to "check" whether they were still in the room -Varying rates depending on how you book. Usually from $150 over xmas up to $390! -First thing they make you sign is that you are unable to get a refund in case you leave early I travelled Austalia for a year and would have exptected this for a room costing $15 to 25 per night instead it was $280 a night!!! Stay somewhere else unless you dont mind dirt.,sirmarc
UR10696299,2007-8-November,Since my father and my brother lived for one week in Riverside Studios hes got the legionrs bacteria and I suppose it is caused by the terrible circumstances in the bathroom. Go to another hotel!!!!!!!Bye.,Wlora
UR10677096,2007-7-November,Absolute garbage. We paid for a hotel room and we got something you wouldnt let your dog sleep. Including the repairs to the air conditioning unit next door at 2.00 am in the morning. The brown water ?? covering the floor of the bathroom was offensive and suggest people take their waterproof footwear if they are going to stay there. The beds were marginally softer than a park bench and the cockroach races were entertaining. We are only thankful we brought our own bug spray. Next time well stay in Central Park on a bench. It was unworthy of the name hotel. Paid New York marathon prices.,Lequaters
UR10620199,2007-5-November,BEWARE OF BEDBUGS AND ABSOLUTE FILTH! This is the NiGHTMARE of ALL hotels and you will have them for months after staying here. I am not particularly fussy. I have stayed in hostels and low budget hotels in New York but Hotel Riverside Studios is simply the worst slum hotel I have ever stayed in. (I had no idea that it was a hotel for residents God help them). Neither human beings nor animals should live in such filth and dirt. I changed rooms 4 times during my 5-day stay. I saw bed bugs on the walls changed rooms once again only to find a couple of bugs in one of my books one day later. I switched rooms again and checked out 1 day early. The hallways are filled with decades of dirt and filth vomit and cigarette butts. The hallways smelled of cigarettes and urine. If that wasn't bad enough the bathrooms were uninhabitable. This slum landlord should be shut down by the NYC health department.,EmilyBoulder
UR8654113,2007-4-September,I read a lot of the reviews and they are all accurate but from different viewpoints. The key is your expectations. The hotel is clean but for the first couple of days I had bugs (not bed bugs) -- my guess is that if the building has bugs the cleanest room will have bugs too. The room I stayed in was drab but clean -- meaning that the floor and counters were all wiped down. That said the paint was peeling and the walls clearly had not been painted in years and the carpet was very old. On the other hand I paid 60-70 a night which is two hundered dollars less than many hotels in the area. The location is great. It took me a couple of nights to get comfortable but I never once saw anything on the bed and the sheets were changed daily. Recommendations: If you just need a bed/shower and can deal with sharing the shower/toilet and very basic accommodations -- consider it. If you are looking to have any kind of romantic involvement -- find a different place. If you will freak out at the sight of any other creatures -- don't even consider it. This goes for most any hotel room: If you do stay there hang everything in the closet. Keep your bags and luggage sealed. Don't leave your stuff in piles anywhere. This will lessen your chances of picking up traveling companions.,gardinerg
UR7683643,2007-23-May,I traveled to NYC to see my brother graduate last year with my dad and sister. My dad booked the hotel online because it was cheap and since he was paying for it all I didn't really have any input. When we got there I cried. Seriously. Every horrible thing you read about this place is 100% true. The air conditioning that was supposed to be in the "suite" was not installed. The tiny rooms were stifling and cramped. My sister and I shared half of the "suite" on a pull out bed. She and I both had itchy watery eyes after the first night. One of my eyes became extremely red and irritated after the second night. I decided to stop using the pillow (even tho I had covered it with a "clean" towel from the bathroom) and instead used a balled up t-shirt to sleep on. My eyes miraculously cleared up. The shower had absolutely no water pressure (altho I hear this is not uncommon in the city) and the drain didn't work so after a 10 min shower that didn't get you clean you were standing in a foot high puddle of water in the dirty grungy tub. I wore my sandals in the shower. Actually I never took my shoes or socks off in the room at all except to sleep. The bubbling ray of sunshine at the front desk was the most miserable man I have ever met. He was there every time we came and went. I suppose if I had to spend that much time in the hotel I would be miserable too. He couldn't even recommend an ice cream shop in the neighborhood which by the way is the ONLY saving grace for this dump. Then again my dad and stepmom were fine with this place and looked at it as just a place to get cleaned up and sleep. They have stayed there since and will again. I guess if you have REALLY low standards have a go. I'll pass.,LHO
UR7191867,2007-19-March,I recently returned from a weekend in New York and a very brief stay in the Riverside Studios. As many have stated the neighborhood was really nice. However the hotel left a lot to be desired. The room was relatively clean but the the labyrinth of hallways were dark dirty and had strange fumes. I was with a group of 5 and all were ready to checkout after having seen the bathrooms which were absolutely filthy!!!!!! We decided to checkout immediately and upon shutting the room door to leave a large piece of wood fell from above and struck me on the head. I would not recommend this hotel for solo female travelers given the dark hallways and complete lack of security.,volvo122
UR8190870,2007-19-July,It amazes me the varying reviews on this hotel. My husband and I are on the " we'll never stay here again" side of things. From the sound of some of the review - there are obviously many different types of rooms you can stay in and maybe that makes a difference. If this place really wants to become a hotel though then it needs to refurbish the rooms and make them more uniform. What we got was a room not much bigger than a dorm room. Stark white walls no artwork at all no mirror or sink in the room. Even if it was clean it just FELT dirty. Pillows that were the thinnest barest pillows. And the shared bathrooms... oi. I will say - never really had to wait. BUT- we had to carry our own toilet paper! They supplied it for us but in our room. We had to take it w/ us when going to use the bathrooms. And the one shower on our hall- no where to hang my stuff. Luckily I took very little w/ me and was able to precariously hang my bag and towel so that they weren't on the floor- because when I showered it didn't DRAIN! By the end I was standing in an inch of water. Trying to dry off and get dressed while standing IN water was quite a test of my balance. And patience. It was also quite hot while we were there- and there is no central air and the bathrooms are not air conditioned either. Very uncomfortable. We've learned our lesson and will be sure to always book earlier so that we don't get stuck at this hotel. I'll gladly pay more for a room elsewhere.,Love_2_WorldTravel
UR10101108,2007-17-October,STAY AWAY! A friend and I stayed hererecently. My friend started having red welts on her lower body. I had a few red "Pimples" on my face and elsewhere. Foolishly we stayed and didn't say / think any thing or say anything to management. IT WAS BED BUGS! I have been home now 2 weeks have been waking up with strange red marks. Called the exterminator in and I have BED BUGS from my stay (the bugs have been found!)! A cheap stay is now costing me a small fortune to rid myself of the problem. This place should be shut down and a reputable site such as Travelocity should not be offering the hotel up for reservations.,foolishtraveler
UR8430850,2007-15-August,There isn't an adjective that adequately describes the horror of this place. "Rat extermination Tomorrow" posted on the lobby wall. This is a shady boarding house- we met a guy who had been there for 10 years- he advised that we not use the shared bathrooms without bringing someone along. The walls were moldy sagging- the ceiling was stained. Windows filmy with filth stained and worn carpet- and from the smell not everyone made it to the bathroom. I'm not a fancy traveler and I've stayed at many hostels this is by FAR the grossest place I've ever seen. We left- but travelocity wouldn't cancel our rooms (so much for the guarantee)- after 90 minutes on the phone with India I gave up. AMEX refunded us. Do not stay here- do NOT be tempted. You will fear for your life. Trip advisor should not offer this place.,velzygirl
UR8693843,2007-11-September,Okay if you're like me you're thinking "How bad could this place be? Decent location great price...I can handle it for a night." WRONG. This is a welfare hotel run by a slum lord who is trying to forcibly evict the poor tenant who's squatting in the room (make that hovel) next to your room. Literally! We passed an open door and saw what we thought was a utility closet but on further inspection was someone's garbage-strewn apartment. There sitting naked in front of a fan was an old man who we would have taken for a corpse if the corridor wasn't echoing with his hacking coughs as he tried in vain to cough up a lung. AAAHH! We didn't actually see a rat but one would feel right at home here. At first glance our room seemed okay until we found a used Q-Tip next to the sink dirt covering the sink and beer caps lining the door frame. "Insider art" you say? You haven't seen the bathrooms yet: try showering while balancing on a moldy corroded and unwashed tub stripped bare of its enamel making sure not to touch the layers of mildew clinging to the chipped tiles. As you run for the elevator be sure to read the eviction notices stamped on doors and say a prayer for the inhabitants who call this place home. Spend forty fifty or a hundred dollars more for a real hotel and enjoy your stay in New York!,inwoodlad
UR7832440,2007-11-June,I booked this hotel on hotelbook.com We stayed only ONE (1) night the duration of our NY visit. I reviewed it thoroughly on tripadvisor before reserving. The double room cost $100.00 including all fees. The hotel is close to the Hudson at 71st and West End Av. It's about a 15 minute walk from Columbus Circle or Strawberry Fields 30 minutes walk from Times Square. The Subway stops 10 minutes or less walk away at 72nd & Broadway. Of course taxis are quicker but I eschew them. The outside looks fine and it's on a nice shaded street with old and new apt. buildings. Inside the desk clerk was surly but someone friendly took us up to our room. The hallway on the 2nd floor (I was in room 2B4) was dank and smelled of smoke. The bathroom was nothing fancy but clean (there are 2 shared baths on that floor). Close the window when you use the shower or there's no privacy. The room itself was fine. It had a sink color TV with limited (about 15) channels a small fridge and a queen size bed. The sheets and floor were clean. The window faced a dark inner courtyard. Other than sleeping we were in the room about an hour. Our floor in the hotel was quiet and we were very tired from lots of walking so we slept great. There's a Whole Foods at Columbus Circle (Time-Life Center an awesome place) and the night before we bought breakfast food and ate at the park along the Hudson River to the West of the hotel. Watched the boats bikers and joggers go by. By the river there's a pier restaurant and a park. I'd also taken an early walk to 80 & Brdwy and bought great bagels and coffee at H&H which is open 24 hours. Then checked out by 9AM...all in all a great experience for the price of a C-note. Doesn't buy what it used to especially in NYC. But this filled the bill nicely.,joshbash
UR8099849,2007-11-July,I stayed here for a few days while i went sight seeing in NYC the hotel is a miserable dump OK its cheap all i can advise is spend more and go elsewhere! Its not clean its shabby and still has that 1930's feel about AVOIDAVOID AVOID is that clear. The rooms are tiny and grubby the only saving grace is that it forced me to spend loads more time in NYC sight seeing :),reLOAD
