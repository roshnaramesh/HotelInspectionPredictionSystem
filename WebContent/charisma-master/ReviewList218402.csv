UR123553368,2012-24-January,This would have been given a three star rating if our room was not tucked away in the basement beside a massive vent. The noise from this could have been a big deal if I didnt have earplugs with me. Thankfully I always travel with them. The aircon in our room when turned off gave a groan every so often too which again could have been an issue if earplugs were not available. When we went into the room the room is very small it could definitely have used a new table as the one we had was dreadful and took away from the room at first glance. We did ask to be moved and was told that the hotel was full but they did offer to move us the fourth floor on the second day but we had unpacked at that stage so we declined. We were staying there with friends. My friends also asked to be moved as they were also in the basment which had the noise of the vent combined with being right beside the kitchen so noise levels were quite high. Our other friend was located on the four floor in a lovely double room with underground heating in the bathroom. Its just luck of the draw which room you get. Having said that the bed was extremely comfortable and the room was clean. If your out and about then somewhere to put your head down is all you need. The tube station is less then 10 minutes walk and we found the location very handy. I would give it a rating of three but as I said putting us in the basement of the hotel beside the vent knocked a star off for me. We paid 207 sterling for three nights which was good value. We were told this was half price. If we payed the full price of over 400 sterling I would have been pretty pissed off. The staff were nice I have to say. We didnt get breakfast so have no comment on that.,Specialk-74
UR125014122,2012-22-February,I had to stay here last night for one night on short notice. Everything else in London seems to have been booked out. If you are 4' 6" tall and do not suffer from claustraphobia then this hotel would be fine. I am 6 foot tall and while I don't suffer from claustrophobia small tight spaces make a little uncomfortable. The bedroom I had was on the ground floor facing the main road. It was very noisey with only single glazing. To give an idea of the size of the room - the bedroom had one standard size double bed. On either side of the bed there was barely 1 foot of clearance until you hit the wall. You could not comfortably walk around the bed so getting into bed by crawling from the end of it was the only way. Not so bad though if the rest of the room was okay. Well there was 2 feet of clearance between the end of the bed and the wardrobe. And that my friends was the extent of the room save the bathroom - which was in all honesty not too bad in terms of size and condition. I entered the room with one average sized wheeled suitcase and a laptop bag. I put them down behind me at the door entrance and at that stage i could not move forward because of the bed and couldn't move backwards because my small amount of baggage was enough to block of the entrance! All in all VERY small. I tend to like to hang up my suit and shirts for the next business day in order that they are not wrinkled. When I attempted to do this I found that the wardrobe was not wide enough to accomodate the width of its own hangers! They hung at an angle which meant that hanging anything more than two items in the wardrobe resulted in the door being wedged open. This had the affect of bunching up the clothes hanging in the wardrobe and actually encrouching into the already sparse space between the end of the bed and the wardrobe. To be fair the room was not in bad condition but it is extremely small. I have stayed in other small city hotels before but this is extremely snug the smallest i have ever seen. For more than one person travelling with more than one suitcase it would be impossible. The only other comments I would have is that the whole hotel is 'snug'. The corridors are narrow. Downstairs for breakfast one is inclinded to bend down going through door ways because of the low ceilings in the basement area. I would hate to see the rooms down there if they are as small as mine on the ground floor coupled with the low ceilings it would be like sleeping in a coffin. So if you are hobit sized with hobbit sized luggage then go for it. If not I would suggest looking else where or at least preparing yourself for a 'snug' experience.,Pastyp
UR107562306,2011-9-May,Possibly the worst customer service ever! I like many other guests faced the same story ( I believe because we booked through late rooms and were paying a cheaper price) on arrival. I was told that due to water problems!! In some of the rooms I had to move to another hotel near Earls Court. However well armed with my Trip Advisor knowledge I refused to budge from the reception desk until they found me a room. I had a meeting at 9am the next day hence why I asked for this hotel location and explained this to the receptionist. She made a big show of phoning 'central reservations' and after the 3rd attempt to send me a way in a taxi ( a queue of spectators was forming by this point!) suddenly a spare room appeared! The end of my woes... Definitely not! the receptionist was rude to me and the others at the desk  my room was the broom cupboard on the ground floor it was noisy all night due to staff talking at reception there were exposed electrical cables and the blankets on the bed were stained. I will be making official complaint to trading standards.,ScottishExposure
UR92102867,2011-7-January,The location was great and the reception staff were pleasant enough. After reading the review's about the size of the room I was a bit aprehensive but it was fine and was clean and looked nice (I was surprised to find out it was 4 star however). The worst thing was the noise - the cleaning staff have no consideration for the customers and bang around/talk loudly outside of the rooms I understand they have a job to do but we paid a lot to stay in this hotel and needed a good rest after our long trip - in the end we left more exhausted than when we arrived! There was a huge air conditioning/ventilation unit outside the window which was very noisy and went off every hour or so actually when it was on it was fine because it drowned out all the other noise but it would go off and on randomly. The worst thing was the fact that there was a door outside the room leading to the reception stairs and the staff were going in and out of this door constantly leaving it to bang closed each time horrible. I told the reception staff to ask them to keep it open and they said they would but this wasn't communicated as I had to go out myself and put the door stop there - which was later removed again. The best thing to do would be to keep it open or use the lift!,lunt82
UR91945349,2011-6-January,When i first booked this hotel online i was really pleased with the value for money; i mean a four star hotel five minutes away from Paddington bargain!!! However when we arrived i knew straight away that it was not going to be an enjoyable stay!! The main entrance doors were made of glass but were on the dodgiest hinges ever every time we opened the door it felt like the glass panel was going to fall off. The reception staff were rude and not very helpful. Once checked into room 801 we made our way to our room this wasn't a very long trip as it turned out that a deluxe double room turned out to be a small store cupboard behind the reception area. There were noises of doors banging all through the night as we were so close to the entrance. Once in the room it just got worse and worse. There were two beds in our room; one single and one small double both were poorly put together fold up beds (the single bed broke when sat on and ended up half folded up by the time we left) the interactive TV service was terrible channels 1-5 and all covered in snow the wireless keyboard for internet access didnt work. The free hotel broadband was so bad that we couldnt get a connection anywhere in the room. The view out of our window was of another window in a room opposite. The lights were randomly scattered around the ceiling and walls and one switch even buzzed and crackled when you turned it on needless to say we left it well alone for the duration of our stay. Things only got worse when I went to use the bathroom the bath was tiny the tile grout was all loose and falling out the shower screen didn't fit over the bath properly and when you turned the shower on it sprayed water in every direction but were it was suppoesed to go!! TERRIBLE HOTEL WILL NEVER TRUST AN AA RATING AGAIN!!! FOUR STARS......... NEVER!!!! FILTHY RUN DOWN AND BADLY RUN!!! I WOULD RATHER STAY AT GUEST HOUSE PARADISO!!!,BenCollins694
UR120166399,2011-4-November,I stayed at this hotel for a week. I started off in the basement with a tiny room facing a wall with slightly damp smelling aircon. The bathroom was tiny and you could only just fit into the area for the WC (I'm average size). The walls on either side of my room were so thin i could hear every word of my neighbour's phone conversation on one side and on the other my neighbours 'being intimate' . Luckily my internet wasn't working (the socket was hanging out of the wall - no wireless available from hotel) so after a couple of days I was upgraded to the third floor in an 'executive studio'. The upgraded room was more spacious and less damp however the door to my room was adjacent to the speaking lift and ALL night long you could hear it saying 'fist floor second floor' etc. The doors also slam quite loudly as they close. Although the bathroom was clean on the surface there was visible mould in my shower in the corners of the silicone grouting. This also led to quite a mouldy smell in the bathroom as a whole. The fittings are all made to seem solid and of quality but this is superficial. Although the hotel's just been redone it's already getting a bit worn and shabby. The rooms also had quite a dark feel to them. I have to say that the staff were all very friendly and helpful with all my enquiries and the location (5 mins to Paddinton) was great but as I like a quiet night's sleep and enough space to swing a cat I would not stay here again.,Goodadvisorreview
UR115007909,2011-4-July,Well I never usually complain about hotels really but felt compelled to in this case. Stayed here for one evening only. Sadly I found things a little sub-standard for a 4 star establishment. I checked in and paid my 129 for a single and was asked for a further deposit of 10?! I was then told that my room was turn left right then up two flights of stairs (I was not offered any help to the room with my heavy bag) then I was greeted by numerous 'Wet Paint' signs all the way up the very narrow staircase and a very strong smell of gloss paint. Trying to manouvre a large bag and myself up this staircase (and I am only a petite size 10!) without getting any gloss on yourself was like an assault course. The rooms were incredibly small (I would actually use the word pokey). They were in the middle of major refurbishments (which I was not informed of) the staff seemed fraught and immediately defensive of any mild criticism. Ongoing refurbishments had evidently left the hotel with no air conditioning (and it was a particularly hot few days) and although electric fans were provided space in the room was so lacking that the fan kept getting knocked over. There was also no mini bar or fridge in the room just an empty cupboard where one had clearly been so keeping cold drinks cool was a problem. Broadband internet access was also advertised however it was slow and intermittant again my complaint was simply greeted with a defensive shrug of the shoulders. In my opinion (and I am aware that this is London pricing) this hotel is completely overpriced and of poor quality this is not a 4 star hotel and although it was clean and modern it is more applicable to a 3 star grading. I stayed in a 4 star around the corner only last year and not only was it much better quality and worthy of its 4 star rating and it was also half the price of this one! I wouldn't say not to go to this hotel but as long as you get a good discount and expect 3 star value you will be happy.,chrissie1969
UR94982827,2011-30-January,Oh how I wish i'd read the reviews on TA before I booked into this place. We arrived at reception to be greeted by the friendly man who took my money on debit card and then told me that due to a building maintence fault (yes that BS line again!) we were being transfered to there sister hotel 5 minutes away. Arrived there and was told that I was actually being put in the special clubrooms around the corner. Arrived to find another hotel complex containing shabby rooms with broken windows! They then put me back into the sister hotel in the basement with room with broken matresses and a bust TV. I complained again and was moved yet again into a shoe box of a room over the road!!!!!!!! This story goes on and on and on until I BLEW my top with the manager and demanded a refund - which they refused to give so I stood in reception shouting and making a massive scene in front of all the hotel guests until I got a full refund and a taxi to the station. THEY ARE CONNING PEOPLE - PLEASE DO NOT MAKE THE MISTAKE I MADE.,SwissUK
UR115955422,2011-29-July,Room description was Ver missleading - This was worse than a travelodge room Damp and torn wall paper. Workmean in the early hours. Location description is missleading. Staff were unhelpfull when questioned over the state of the room on line feedback was also ignored. Never Again !!,ribs160379
UR121120319,2011-28-November,Room advertised at 350 deluxe single-for a broom cupboard Incredibly small -probably smallest room I have ever stayed in-made premier inn look like a palace very deceptive policy poor hotel in general,susan s
UR114849638,2011-28-June,I recently stayed in this hotel during a weekend trip to London as I was going to Hard Rock Calling in Hyde Park. Both myself and my partner were extremely looking forward to our stay in the 'delux doube suite' which I booked for 150 per night (not including breakfast may I add). The hotel initially appears to have some potential- it seems clean enough and looks fairly standard from the outside. The location is also fairly central- only a short walk away from Paddington station however upon further inspection the walls and ceiling were yellow with dampness and there is no bar or restaurant available till after 6pm. We had specifically asked for an early check in and although we were initially told upon arrival that the room would be ready for 11am- we were still waiting at 1.50pm. The hotel staff didnt communicate with us in English much except for the Bellboy who seemed more than happy to help us. When we eventually got into our room we were totally disappointed as the room was tiny and we had to walk in single file sideways to get around as there was only room for the double bed. There was metal poles sticking out of the wall which may have been the result of air conditioning removal but the job has never been finished. The hot and cold tap has been installed back to front which took us a while to figure out and so we found ourselves washing in cold water then later brushing our teeth with scalding hot water! The room doors dont close properly which we only realised the next day-when we noticed the door had been open all night and upon leaving another resident was complaining that her belongings were missing after she went out and like us never noticed the door only sounds like its closing. There was a que of very unhappy customers when we checked out the next day and we left wondering what a standard double room could possibly look like since ours was apparently delux. A very dissapointing hotel in an area where many other more appealing hotels are available for much more reasonable prices. Also would have been nice to find staff talking in English more as we felt very uncomfortable and misnderstood during our interactions with some of the receptionist staff.,traceymclardy
UR122174624,2011-28-December,I booked last minute looking for a place to stay in London during London Brand and Licensing in October and have only had time to catch up now. On arrival they said they had no booking from me - as far as I can establish this happens when you book via a third party like Ebookers. It's not usual for them not to receive the booking outright (sometime it's in a company name like ORBITZ but never not there). Not sure what the game is there but there were 2 other business people in the same position when I arrived so this seems to be an upsettingly frequent occurrence. Room was small for usual but adequate was barely in it due to meetings anyway so was not overly concerned about the room as a result. Bathroom was cramped but again fully furnished so no real issues - except my view was of the same horrible back-yard that someone else posted. Complete with same mangy mattress et al. Would not recommend unless you really need a place near the station or such to get out to Heathrow or a one night business trip where all you will do is sleep there...assuming they remember you have a room!,liceas
UR121091672,2011-27-November,Smallest double ever! Couldn't walk round the bed had to climb over each other. TV did not work which they tried to hide by removing the remote control. Premier Inn or Travel Lodge next time rather than this,Ian G
UR101699614,2011-27-March,Booked a twin room as attending a function with a colleague from work on arrival place was like a building site scaffolding and numerous builders we were given a tiny double room with a double bed it definitely was not a room with a view as we looked over other rooms and scaffolding. we asked if we could change to a room with twin beds as booked  and were told no other rooms available we asked if we could upgrade and have a single room each again no rooms staff were so unhelpful. We contacted a colleague who had booked for us and then surprise surprise we were offered a three person room with single beds this was after we had been told no rooms available so the staff were obviously not telling the truth!!!!!! rooms are extremely small and bathrooms even smaller I couldn't wait to leave I would advise anyone who has booked a room here to change asap,amsull
UR118620624,2011-26-September,Unfortunately the wonderful hotel near Hyde Park where I usually stay was fully booked so I stayed in Shaftesbury Premier London Hyde Park. I wasn't only I have the view of rubbish from my window but everything else is rubbish in this hotel apart from the location. They charge you the whole amount on check in but they are very reluctant to provid a VAT receit not to mention itemized billing. Don't be fooled broadband internet means no wifi but a ropey cable coming from the wall so no chance to connect your iPad. And for 150 staying in the basement staring at dirty matrasses and broken chairs? No thank you. Take the advice of a seasoned traveller and don't even think about ever staying in this please if you want pleasent memories from a holiday or just good night sleep on a business trip.,szinbad
UR109821083,2011-25-May,On arrival at this hotel we were upgraded from double to family rooms which I have no doubt was intended as a kind gesture but the result was we were both in cramped over crowded accomodation. In one room you couldn't open the wardrobe door in the other you couldn't walk round a bed but had to cllimb over it: a classic case of hotel managers trying to squeeze quarts - or even gallons - into pint pots! The hotel's facilities did not reflect the description of 4* laid out by Visit England or the AA and I have reported this to their inspectors. Tea and coffee making facilities were of poor quality. Room fridges/minibars and hospiitality had been removed. The hair drier was wired into a wall that did not have a mirror and the flex would not stretch to one. The ironing board was simply propped up loose against a wall will a burned and torn cover. There was no upholstered chair in the room and no side table. The hotel is clearly being refurbished and both rooms had very nice new shower room suites and had been recently redecorated. Nonetheless the rooms were so small it was difficult to sit on the lavatory Bedroom furniture was old and shabby: scuffed marked handles loose and missing; and the bed sheets were worn and in one case torn. Throughout corridors coils of electrical cabling and piles of old newspapers were sitting on the floors for the duration of the weekend. On chekcing in and being asked to pay in full up front we were not informed that the air conditioning was broken. Later that evening we were told that it was in the process of being repaired - the repairs were not effective all weekend. Fans were not available and staff were not willing to sort any out for us. On three seperate occasions I asked for the duty manager to contact me. He/She failed to do so for the whole weekend. The breakfast room was clean and the cooked breakfast on offer was freshly cooked and plentiful if a little limited in options. The quality of the continental breakfast items was below par: tinned fruit processed cheese and mechanically recovered meats. As in the bedrooms tea and coffee were of a very poor quality. Candidly this hotel is not what is puports to be. It is not a patch on other 4* hotels in London. It's not anywhere cheap enough to make up for this. With the Lancaster at the end of the street less than 1/4 mile away offering vastly better accomodation and service plus fantastic views over Hyde Park for only 20 per night more I see no reason to ever visit this hotel and certainly will not trouble to return to it. Not only will I not recommend it I would warn friends against the Shafsbury Premier Hyde Park.,K8TNorthumberland
UR109606362,2011-24-May,I write this with the understanding this is London! I had an extended business stay. When I first arrived I was going to check out the next day thinking I couldn't stand it. but because of my work schedule I stayed. Up early home late. There is no doubt it is the smallest room I have stayed in in my life. I have never had a berth on a ship smaller. I literally could not open my bag in the door way. I must of had a renovated room as the shower / toilet area was new. I am not a big person but if I dropped the soap I could not bend over to pick it up. But it was very clean. A big person could not have slept on the bed it was so small. I could literally feel the springs. Pretty aweful. The staff did their best to be pleasant but there seemed always to be a probelm at check in time. Reading the other reviews I can only guess people have issues checking in. I arrived early but a room was made available immediately. The worst issue I had is that without doubt my room had dust mites. I do not suffer from allergies but my God I would wake up with itchy eyes and would sneeze for five minutes when I finally got out of the room. This said the room was cleaned to the best of the staffs ability every day. I think the place is just so small beds cannot be moved to vaccum correctly. I definately will not stay there again mainly because of the dust mite issue. The staff were fine the cleaners really did their best. The place is just to small and to cramped for space.,cranjee
UR114706694,2011-24-June,We arrived at 20.00 after a long journey to be told that there wasn't a room for us. We would be moved to their sister hotel and upgraded - this was realy really inconvenient - we had arranged a meeting for dinner at somewhere nearby. We got to the other hotel as fast as possible checked in left our luggage and went out for dinner. We got to the room at about 23.00 and our hearts sank. This was an upgrade!!! How bad could the other room have been. It was tiny - no room to move no room to put a case. Hot and stuffy flies buzzing about (only two to be fair) dirty and scuffed. A shower too small to use. It was along miles of corridors on the second floor didn't connect with the lift felt like a fire hazard. No drinks in room. Bar when found was closed. Air conditioning worked eventually but sounded like a drowning whale. Trying not to be too negative - there was a nice tree outside the window. Go somewhere else.,alfie0312
UR118436787,2011-22-September,Stayed here last night and will never do it again. Purchased through Lasterooms as it was one of the only 'resonably' priced hotels in London left at such a late stage I used reasonable loosely as it was in excess of 200 which in this case is daylight robbery. I arrived to find the lights not working in my room and it took all of 40minutes to get the hotel to do soemthing about it - stood in the lobby argueing the toss with the Manager who seemed reticent to help. I started to feel like an inconvenience to them. The Shaftsbury Suites Marble Arch is one of my favourite properties in London so I cant understand why this hotel another in their portfolio is so poor.,Chippyqueen
UR94007107,2011-21-January,As I write it is 3.45 in the morning. I should be asleep. I want to sleep. I need to sleep. I arrived here after a long flight and a tiring business trip. I chose this hotel because it is close to Paddington station and I need to catch a train home in the morning. I found it on Booking.com where it is rated as a four star hotel. They are having a laugh. In summary the room is small hot uncomfortable overlooking a busy road and to cap it all the walls are paper thin. So I can hear every word of the party and chat in the room next door. I am now resigned to get no sleep whatsoever. The foreign staff on the reception desk are trying to be helpful but their english language ability is worse than the staff at the hotel I was staying in abroad. My strong recommendation is Do Not Stay Here. I can't wait to get out.,Thirtyyearjourno
UR121336851,2011-2-December,It's hard to write a review on this place given that we didn't make it past the lobby. We booked here despite reading some of the reviews and wish we hadn't. On arrival we were told that there was no record of our booking and that the hotel was overbooked. We were offered a cab to the alternative hotel they offered but were also informed it would be quicker to walk. After lugging our bags through the streets we made it to the Best Western Shaftesbury Paddington Court London. Additionally we attempted to contact the hotel numerous times prior to arriving in London to discuss altering our booking with no response. We have the feeling this "lost booking" story is used regularly to fill the hotel and shuffle excess guests to sister hotels. Do yourself a favour and find a good hotel near a tube station and catch the train to Paddington instead.,TorynAaron
UR114081091,2011-17-June,I have traveled extensively both domestically and internationally. This is one of the worst hotels I have ever stayed in. The first room I stayed in was in the basement and you could not walk around the bed it was so small. They then moved to a room on the first floor (actually second) which was even smalled probably about 6 X 9. I had to walk up and down stairs with my luggage. When I first got there the hotel I booked into was full so they put me in a "sister" hotel across the street. The porter and I walked to the other hotel in the dark dodging pot holes around a construction area. The only good thing was the free high speed internet which worked great. The staff was not very courteous or helpful either.,Suzanne097
UR104391693,2011-17-April,it started badly and got worse like many others we arrived to be told that the room we booked was unavailable and that we could transfer. when I said the hotel is not convenient I was told find another one - in central London at short notice!! I was then informed I should have called hotel to confirm booking which I did was then told sorry we had a trainee working needless to say other than providing a complentary cab to their hotel the service was terrible,Leedslad79
UR108346331,2011-15-May,We never physically made it to the hotel. We booked this one and then got a call the night before we were due to go. Low and behold they had had a flood and we were to be moved to a sister hotel. Have a look at other reviews to see how often this occurs.When we checked online we found that the 'sister' one was a bed bug infested one. Naturallly we cancelled. Since then we have had our card cloned. Now we cannot prove this is linked however this card was only used when booking this venue online and nowhere else so draw your own conclusions. My best advice would be to avoid like the plague!!!!,FrankW33
UR92899421,2011-14-January,Found this hotel via late rooms and it seemed a bargain... close to Paddington and a 4 star (this I somewhat doubt). Pros Good location Good Price Cons Monumentally Small Bathroom Non Functional Air Con Unable to open windows (Pigeons nesting on window sill) Very Poor Customer Service Certainly not a 4 star hotel - more like 2.. Over priced breakfast Serious lack of plug sockets - only 1 in the room (All equipment in room powered from spurs) Very poor lighting Would we stay here again - NO. Would I stay we with chain again -NO. Avoid Avoid Avoid,mike137
UR96575965,2011-14-February,Booked this hotel on lastminute.com as a "mystery hotel" but specifically because we wanted to be in that area of London. Arrived to be told there was a maintenance fault and they would taxi us across to another hotel in their chain "just the other side of Hyde Park" but no specific information as to what hotel and where. Having looked at trip advisor subsequently it seems clear that this hotel is blatantly overbooking its rooms and then sending you to another hotel. Now I can't say what the Hyde Park Premier is like inside as I never made it into a room but the Kensington Townhouse where we were sent was absolutely horrendous. I would not book with this chain again and would urge you not to also.,MidgetGem1980
UR103739316,2011-12-April,I booked this hotel last minute but regardless the booking agent should have mentioned that 4 floors were under massive construction. We were awaken every morning (wed-sat) by hammering. sawing and what ever else you hear on a construction site. I was on the 7th floor and the elevator doesnt even run up there so we had to carrying our luggage up a winding staircase and through a slender hall. It wouldnt have been too bad but it was also extremely warm on the 7th floor. The AC unit was not working in our room so our only choice to open the windows and let more sound in. There was an issue with the new door system so we had to re set our keys every afternoon. We did have a leaky shower but after one complaint a maintenance man came up and fixed it immediately. The staff was pleasant and nice but i am sure they were bombarded. The rooms were very clean small but big TV and nice furniture. The location is great. Just far enough from paddington to avoid the noise but a nice walk in a beautiful area. I might give them a 2nd chance once the construction is done but i need a while to get over that.,tarabyrne2
UR103636375,2011-11-April,I just checked in to the hotel. When I arrived I had to look closely as it did look like it's being renovated and not open for business. The check-in was fairly easy but a couple of people were complaining nothing serious though. I was told my room is in the basement and that's when I realized that things can't be that good. I got into the lift and pressed the B button which had a paper covering it (freshly torn) informing guests that they shouldn't head to the basement. I did. I was met by painters and the smell of fresh paint TVs Safes etc. strewn all over the basement. I struggled with my suitcase and managed to find my room through the wonderful fumes only to find what can only be described as the smallest room in London. I've stayed in hotels that aren't allegedly "four stars" and that cost far less than this. I've stayed at bed and breakfasts and hotels that have had lower ratings on Trip Advisor but this is a joke. I called reception to ask if I could be moved I heard the receptionists talking and one asked the other which company I was with she said none and so I was told that the hotel is "full" and that they might be able to move me tomorrow. Furthermore while the website states that there is a safe in the room there isn't. My advice steer clear and stay at one of the many B&Bs in this area or in Kensington. They will be cheaper and better (they can't possibly be worse).,k_in_london186338
UR121594985,2011-10-December,Do not stay at these hotels. I recently had a confirmed booking (with credit card) only to find there were no rooms at all. They said it was because of maintenance but I asked around and other hotels told me they over book and simply ship you out to another hotel - if they can find one. There were four other customers in the same boat as me and it was not pleasant. Apart from this scam they lied to me and it seems other hotels know what is going on. My strong advice to all is DO NOT USE THE SHAFTESBURY BRAND OF HOTELS.,Fred P
UR58123020,2010-9-March,Stayed there on a weekend we were given a room next to the lift you could not get round the bed and there was no bedside table. The shower opened on to the sink if you were a larger person you could not have had a showerthe tiles were not safe as they moved when you walked on them. Also the view was of pidgeons in a court yard with mess everywhere. The second bedroom was on floor 5 which had two lots of steps to go down to get to the beds that nite the people on the top floor deceided to have a rave and even after being told to turn it down of which they did they soon turned it up making for a very disturbing nite.,henryellis
UR78638333,2010-7-September,This hotel isn't terrible its just average. Online it says four star but I thought this was more like a two-three star. Its close to Paddington station just a five minute walk. Reception was a bit slow and we were put in a basement room which was in a maze underneath the hotel. The view was of a wall. The room itself was I thought rather small barely big enough for a double bed. The bathroom needed refurbishment. Its unfortunate that it charges a four star price of 85 a night but fails to deliver.,Sapengro
UR70017037,2010-7-July,I flew into London on a Sunday for business purposes and chose to stay in this hotel due to its proximity to Paddington Station. A colleague was flying in on a flight a couple of hours after me and we both used the online booking system provided on the hotels website to book our rooms. On arrival I was told by the receptionist that there was no record of my booking. I provided her with a printout of the details and she told me it would take "5-10 Minutes" to get in touch with the reservations office and sort my booking. After 25 minutes waiting in reception I told the receptionist that I was due to meet people on the evening for work purposes and that I needed to get into my room to get changed as I was now running late. She told me she would contact reservations again. At this stage the most irritating aspect of what was happening was that the receptionist was spending more time joking and laughing behind the counter with one of her colleagues rather than trying to rectify the problem. It took another 20 minutes before I was finally given a key card to a room (45+ minute delay to get the key card). While standing waiting for this problem to be sorted another guest arrived to reception to complain that there were no towels in his room. Having finally received my key card I made my way to the room - but the key didn't work open the door. I returned to reception and asked to speak with a Manager but was told "there's none on duty". I told her I found it exceptional that there was no Duty Manager at 7pm on a Sunday evening to which she replied "It's too late". I rang my colleague who was flying in a couple of hours after me to warn him of the difficulties I'd encountered with the hotel. On his arrival he was told there was no record of his booking. After a significant delay for him he was given a key to a room which had three single beds in it rather than the double he'd booked. To the best of my knowledge there was no fitness centre in the hotel - but if they wished to establish one then they could certainly have used the room I was staying in as the sauna. The room was small with a tiny window and the air conditioning didn't work! The heat was unbearable. I have stayed in many hotels around the globe for the purposes of business and pleasure and I can honestly state that this in probably the worst I ever stayed in. I would say without doubt that it's a miracle that the hotel is accredited as 4*. If you're considering staying in this hotel do yourself a favour and find an alternative!!,DarraghMcS
UR85465929,2010-31-October,Should have taken more note of the reviews. I'd thought "Hey it's 4* and it will be okay ignore the negative comments they probably just had bad luck and got the one dodgy room" but apart from the fairly good location there's isn't much more I can say in a positive tone. The room was tiny and dark bed was small and uncomfortable shower small and door broken. Check in was poor no details of any bar breakfast room etc. Nothing in the room either. Basement rooms have metal window frames that fit poorly and with minimal security. I wouldn't stay again and would question the AA start rating on this one more 1-2 if that.,jodola
UR54664877,2010-29-January,Stopped over for 18 hours on the way back from India. Check in was chaos. One gentleman had been there 3 hours trying to check in. Asked a simple question about where there was a pub in the area with good fish & chips. All I got was "I don't know sir". Breakfast price was a set 15 pounds no menu no options. When I asked about restaurants in the area again all I got was "I don't know sir".,bittenbytravelbug10
UR72339569,2010-26-July,A dreadful experience. Absolutely NOT a Four Star Hotel - 2.5 would be very generous! No safety deposit box in room - until we complained. Room a 'matchbox'! Air con worked - probably would have left otherwise and suffered the loss of our money. Cleanliness - very suspect in areas i.e. a blanket on the bed - serious health issues with this! "The Bar" turned out to be a "hatch" down in the basement breakfast room. Worst hotel we have ever stayed in and we are well travelled and not unreasonable. This 'dive' should be closed down.,marymikeforrest
UR62218629,2010-23-April,Before I went I checked the tripadvisor reviews one of which referred to previous guests being told on arrival there was a problem and saying there was a spare room in a "nearby" hotel. What a coincidence! On arrival I was told there had been a water leak my single room was not usable and so I had been allocated a room in one of their sister hotels. I complained and asked to speak to a manager. The receptionist rang him and she told me he had agreed to an upgrade to a double room (in this hotel). i was very grateful and intended to email and thank the manager. However the room I was given was like a prison with only one window that looked out onto an internal passageway and the ac was faulty. Don't take the risk - it is not worth it.,Philip26
UR68152412,2010-21-June,Great location 5 mins walk to subway (Bayswater and Queensway) close to ammenities and facilities 5 mins walk to Hyde park and 10 to Notting Hill. Travelled with my girlfriend booked a double room and as usual got twins which is quite annoying. Got the disabled room it was late and we decided to stayed there but we asked the staff to get a different room next day. Didn't work out. Again hotels never think about this questions I travelled with my girlfriend and get twins we found a lady with her husband and two kids booked a separate room for the kids and they've got a ... double room ... and they were annoyed as well. Our room was on the ground floor and the window was facing the street so a lot of noise overnight as it is a busy street and specially in the morning. Couldn't open the curtains as everybody can see you. Again disappointing. The quality of the room was ok but not considering the money you pay. It is definitely not worthy. Service is helpful but ... again if you don't get the proper room i don't care if the service is helpful. The size of the bathroom is ridiculous as everthing included is significantly small. I won't pay that money anymore for staying there. Do prefer to get a back packers hostel in which at least you pay less money for the same level of quality.,luisinho80
UR68104172,2010-20-June,My wife and I Stayed here 18th and 19th of June Was waiting 15 muinets to be checked in The receptionist took my credit card and just before she gave me my room card key she asked for my credit card again as she had made a mistake and had not charged me enough I gave it to her and she charged me again When we went to the room I was amazed it was the smalest room I have ever been in You had to hang your clethes sideways in the wardrope I said nothing as we were only there for two nights We went out for dinner and a walk  when we came back we decided to have a drink in the bar there was a sign saying take a seat and someone would come and serve you we waited for 15 muinets and no one cameWe could see four staff standing around reception from our seating area in the bar so I decided to go out to them and ask for some service A young male rudely told me that the bar was closed at 11 oclockI told him I was a resident and he said that it did not matter that residents make noise when they have too much drink I went into the bar and told my wife who said to me it was only 10-54 at that time and again I went out and pointed out that it was not 11 oclock and that I had been waiting in the bar for at least 20 muinets at this timeThen a different young man came in and served me 2 bottles of Warm Bud and a glass of wine he told me that they used to leave the bar open until 12 but now were closing around 11 as residents were making too much noiseOn Saturday 19th after coming back from all day sightseeing there was a flyer under our door saying that the Boiler had Broken down and that there was no hot water but that they were working on it So we had a cold shower The following morning the boiler was still not fixed Another cold shower The Breakfast on both mornings was okWhen I was checking out the receptionist never offered any apology about NO Hot WATERBut asked me could she have my credit card again as they had undercharged me by 5 poundsI refused gave them my buisness card and told the receptionist that if they wanted the 5pounds to have the General Manager contact meThis hotel is Definitly not 4 star I Would regard it as bad 3 star My advise to anyone is DO NOT STAY HERE,PatOMayo
UR73384163,2010-2-August,The room was 12 x 7 ft INCLUDING a shower room I was completey dumbfounded. I'm only a size 12 and found it ridiculously difficult to get into the shower and wash without banging my elbows constantly. Because the room was so small I injured my legs on the bedside table and desk as the gap to get through was so small. It was a dark dingy and not that clean the staff were indifferent looked at you like you had 2 heads. We cut our 4 night stay short and left the next morning even having to pay for the 2nd night despite not staying didn't matter we just had to get out of there. They take 10 per night off your card in case you want to charge anything to your room they tell you they are just holding it not actually TAKING it but my credit card company told me they had in fact taken the money when I rang them up to ask them to give me it back they were rude difficult and argued with me and I just thought well I'll check my credit card bill when it comes and if they've not refunded this supposedly 'held' money then I'll just take them to court. Do not risk staying here whatever the price/deal you can get it's just not worth the trauma.,KitRedcar
UR80135676,2010-19-September,We stayed here for 2 nights and that was more than enough. Had a room on the 7th floor which was right next to the lift machinery so there was constant noise every time the lift was used. It was at the back of the hotel and had good views over London and the windows opened properly which were good points. Very small room and bathroom TV didn't work properly complained three times but nothing done asked for another light as lighting was very poor my husband had to go in the bathroom to read the paper! Only lighting was 2 small downlighters and two wall lights over bed. Bed comfortable. As stated by other reviewers not a 4 star by any means and wouldnt stay here again.,lella007
UR87577717,2010-19-November,When we got there it seemed like a nice enough place until we got up to our room. It was tiny! We barely had room for anything inside there and had to live out of out bags for the two nights we stayed. The bathroom was the smallest bathroom I have ever seen. You walk in and thats it. You can turn to use the toilet turn to use the sink and step into the shower. That was it. For our two night stay we had no hot water at all. We complained to the girl in reception who said she'd send someone to fix it while we were out. We came back it was still cold. I complained two more times about it. Nothing was done but instead we were offered complimentary breakfast. The staff bar one girl had a terrible arrogance about them. They didnt really seem to care about us at all during our stay. I would never stay here again nor would I recommend this hotel to anyone. We payed a lot of money for a "4 star hotel" and basically got a b&b.,bobbobgrr
UR56514582,2010-19-February,We were booked in to stay at the Shaftesbury Premier London Hyde Park. But like many people found on our arrival that they had a problem (gas leak on this occasion) and we would have to be re located to another of their hotels which was still a 4 star hotel and had been refurbished in the last 3 months. (Why did they not call us they had our home and mobile numbers). We where asked to pay for our stay before they would book a taxi to take us to the our new hotel. We were not told the name of the new hotel or its location just that it was about a 10 minute walk away. The taxi turned out to be a mini bus which we think belonged to the hotel as it was not marked as a taxi. We were then taken to the new hotel and dropped about 50m from the entrance. The driver pointed to the hotel and then was off no chance to say no take us back. The Grand Royale is a very old hotel and in its day (1850'ish) would have been called Grand. We had booked the Shaftsbury as we like hotels with a modern interior. At reception they informed us that they knew we were coming but our room was not ready so we left our bags and went for a walk. On returning an hour later we collected our key and were told where our room was (not shown). The maid was still cleaning the room and we had to wait for another 15 mins. THE ROOM!! We had booked a Superior Room. Good points - yes it was clean yes it had a bed and a TV. Bad points - The bed was a small double we can't remember the last time we had a hotel bed this small!!! There was about a foot of space on either side of the bed infact it was so close to the wall that my partner stubbed his toe on the radiator during the night. Looking on the bright side there was no chance of falling out of bed - there was no room!!! The bathroom - Yes it was new but very very small. Infact I am only short (5'2") but I could touch both walls both width and depth ways!! The last time I was in a bathroom that size was on a caravan holiday. The side of the bath was also very high which made it hard to get out of. The shower panel was so small that the bathroom was flooded when you used it. We were in a room at the back of the hotel our view was of the back of flats and shops and the rubbish bins. So closed the curtains and didn't look again. Now to breakfast. We had breakfast on the first day but did not bother on the second. Most of it was cold the fruit juice had run out and we had to ask for them to refill the containers. Watch out!! We had paid for breakfast at the Shaftesbury but when we checked at reception they said we hadn't we had taken our booking paperwork with us which showed breakfast included. The receptionist said she would take this off the bill but when we checked out we were still asked to pay for it. Also the bar was closed during our stay. Overall we were very disappointed this was not what we would have expected in a 4 star hotel and would not book with Shaftesbury Hotels again. If you do book with them then it would be a good idea to ring them on the day you are due to stay with them and find out if there are any problems with your room or the hotel!!,OutandaboutHants
UR71256114,2010-17-July,All other reports on trip advisor about overbooking and maintenance are correct. We were lied to by reception staff moved to Earls Court only to find that there were no rooms free there either - eventually we were given a room in the basement - damp dripping air conditioner AWFUL. Moved back to Hyde Park Premier after one night after MUCH arguing with staff. Rooms are tiny no fridge staff were without exception disgraceful. I am sure this hotel deliberately overbooks and has every intention of taking advatage of customers who are forced to pay in full before they arrive. Even if the service had been good the cleanliness and general standard of this hotel is 3 star at best definitely not worth the price.,emmakirbs
UR83351515,2010-13-October,If you are any bigger than me (I am a UK size 12) you would not fit into the shower as the door does not open fully as it hits the sink. The shower does not drain away. The bed was against the window and wall the lighting in the room was dire and depressing and felt like you were in a cellar (I was on floor 2) The windows were single glazed and very old so felt unsecured. The TV was next to the bed so you couldn't watch it from the bed. This room was classed as 'Deluxe'. It's the worst hotel room I have ever stayed in and I stay in London regularly.,RuthSJ
UR69395562,2010-1-July,Many reviews of this hotel are very damning but we did not get the chance to experience it because despite booking two months in advance paying upfront and having proof they denied all knowledge of our booking and claimed to be full. Since we chose the hotel for its location close to Hyde Park we were very unhappy about being offered an alternative in Earl's Court. We then had a dispute about the taxis provided to take us to Earl's Court and then to the concert which was a wedding anniversary treat. Staff were rude and unhelpful as though they were being inconvenienced not us. To cap it all having been offered parking as a concession we returned to find a note saying our car would be impounded because no-one had thought to give us the docket needed for the windscreen. Other customers at reception were being moved into the hotel as we were being moved out and the company seems to have a contract with a taxi company to move customers around London to suit themselves. OVERBOOKING SEEMS TO BE VERY COMMON.,DatchetMorrisman
UR46182711,2009-8-October,I'm just back from a stay in London where I stayed at this hotel for the last two days. It almost ruined our trip. We booked with londonnights.com. We used a Maestro card and the booking was confirmed. When we arrived we were asked if we wanted to pay with the same card and we said yes. Turned out they don't accept the card (we're from Ireland and even though in their literature they say they accept this card they don't. Shops/Restaurants in London did). They agreed we could pay in cash which we said we would do the next day. Next day we paid the cash but we had run up a bill of 100. (60 of which was for 4 breakfasts). We said we would pay this on checkout the next day as we would normally do. This was fine by them apparently. We went to London had a great day and when we returned that night our keys would not open the doors. My kids were left tired waiting on the landing steps while I tried to sort out the problem. They were insisting that we pay the balance now even though we weren't booking out till the next morning. I hadn't got the cash then and there so the only way they would open the doors was if we handed over our passports. This we did and next day we paid up and left. I know this is a personal story I haven't mentioned the non-existence of a bar etc. but if you take my advice if you're looking for a friendly comfortable atmosphere please save yourself grief DO NOT STAY WITH THESE PEOPLE.,DubChelseafan
UR34043010,2009-6-July,It seems we weren't the only ones who got bumped from this hotel on friday night seeing other reviews on this site. Hen do - 12 of us. Booked way way back in january and confirmed two days before arrival. Arrived at 11pm to be told we had no rooms. The staff were unhelpful to say the least. After nearly two hours of heated debate we were packed off to BERMONDSEY ... to a (must say) very lovely hotel - gorgeously kitted out apartments ... one problem - it was half built. there were wires hanging out of the ceilings in the hall ways ... it was a building site. AND they wanted to charge us 130 for the one night as opposed to the 110 for both nights we were expectign to pay at the shaftsbury. I have never in my life experienced such incompetence. DO NOT STAY HERE,DaveAngelStroud
UR24159500,2009-3-February,Very bad experience small rooms not clean enough noisy and above all customer service is non-existant. Avoid this hotel.,businesstravel04
UR31041786,2009-28-May,I was given a tiny basement room with a window that opened onto a basement patio used by hotel staff for smoking and for storing broken furniture - unpleasant view and unpleasant smell of smoke resulted if one left the window open. Also room security was poor in that the window easily accessible from the street only had an ordinary catch. I asked to be moved and was given a room on the ground floor even smaller than the first! There was no space even to open my suitcase. On a positive note the Night Manager was very attentive.,mike2vc
UR26926525,2009-27-March,Shocking service having booked to stay in this four star hotel on my arrival at about 8.30pm and rather tired from travelling I was dumped with no explanation to The Hyde Park hotel in Bayswater an even more cramped noisy and cold three star joint (which has a cheaper list price than what I paid through lastminute.com). And it took about another hour for me to get there. I had booked weeks in advance of this and was appalled at this behaviour. Don't book here who knows where you will end up.,StepDoh
UR25125438,2009-25-February,Just don't go there!! Problems checking in problems checking out. Staff (and head office staff) not at all helpful. Booked with Ebookers (can't recommend them either). Hotel bill paid before I travelled but hotel wanted it again. I had payment confirmation with me but they just didn't care (or listen). Hotel blamed Ebookers. Ebookers blamed hotel - and I'm out of pocket as a result. NIGHTMARE,Cleo14England
UR38634965,2009-24-August,We stayed here three nights. Room was small at the end of a very narrow corridor. In our room there was an emergency exit and it sound like behind that door was an office or a laundry or both. Bathroom was nicely decorated but the shower was very poor. No pressure and the water was either too cold or too hot. Fortunately we didn't spent our holiday in that room only slept and took the shower as well as we could there. Short distance from Paddington station that's the only plus.,liliaada
UR35532858,2009-23-July,I booked the Premier on line through Wotif.com. The price was ok however the photos of the hotel were a little misleading in how they appeared. The staff worked hard to please and meet all my needs however the rooms were not up to par. They were new and clean but had several issues. The beds were cheap and unstable. After I complained about the first room the hotel tried to put me in a better room which did have a bath however it didn't actually solve the problem. The rooms are cheaply fitted out with gear that looks ok but is not good. The hotel was stuffy with stale air. The rooms were either hot and stuffy or when you turned the air-conditioner on they became a fridge. If you spilt water in the bathroom there was no where for it to drain. I am surpirised the hotel passed building inspection and fire clearance. If there was a fire you would have real trouble getting out in time! Most rooms in London are on the small side especially on the budget end of the market however this was ridiculous. The room was far to small for two people even through it had a double bed you could not hold two suitcases let alone two people in the room. The breakfast was surprisingly good and fresh. The staff did work hard to met your needs and were polite at all times. The rooms were not good and the owners appear to be trying to profit at the expense of their customers. I will not stay there again!,Saustin48
UR23766381,2009-21-January,The hotel is a short distance from Paddington tube and main line station and set back off the road it's in a quiet location. Check-in was quick and the staff helpful. However having read reports I feared the worst when I had to squeeze down the corridor to my room or should I say box. It seems the company who run the hotel has compromised on guest comfort by forcing as many rooms as they possibly can into the smallest available area. The room was incredibly small and I would never have believed it possible to get a single bed bedside table dressing table and wardrobe into such a small area. It means there's an area the size of a chess board to stand up in. I would also mention that the walls are paper thin which doesn't help when the guest in the next room is watching TV until the early hours. The bathroom was equally tiny and once in the shower I had difficulty closing the door and then could only manage to get one arm above my head to wash my hair. I'm by no means the biggest of men so how some one any larger would manage I can only guess. The room was clean enough as was the rest of the hotel. I didn't eat breakfast or go in the bar so can't comment. The whole experience was just one of claustrophobia.,KevinHughes
UR24792151,2009-19-February,This hotel is a set of hotels created by the London Premier hotels and all of them are the same. Run by inexperienced staff poor quality build really uncomfortable bed and finally room that are the size of most cupboards. They have made these hotel room so small that the best virtually do not fit into them. All three sides of the best touch the wall (I suppose you can be assured you wont fall out of bed) Most dissatisfied stay ever !,WorldTraveller0476
UR42459470,2009-17-September,arrived at 11pn - a woman on her own - only to be told that there were maintenance problems and I had to stay at a hotel round the corner. Having booked this hotel on lastminute.com and been promised a 4* deluxe double room I ended up in a hotel that would be lucky to get a star! The first room they gave me the lock didn't even work. This is no way to treat your guests - I will never stay at this chain of hotels again. Can't comment on what the hotel is like as I never actually got to see it!,LondonMissB
UR41682188,2009-14-September,DO NOT BOOK AT THIS HOTEL ITS A CON We were in London for the BBC Proms in the Park a very busy night where a 40000 crowd descend on the Hyde Park area. As expected finding a hotel within walking distance of Hyde Park for this date proved difficult on a modest 100 p/night budget. Eventually we found the Shaftesbury Premier London Hyde Park Hotel which ticked all the boxes; perfect location (500m from Hyde Park) 4 star the right price(99). We made the booking through www.booking.com where there appeared to be a choice of 2 rate types. 1) Flexible  This is not to be confused with other hotel chains terminology where flexible means you can cancel but you pay a premium. If you read the Ts and Cs youll find that this hotels flexible rate means that on the day of arrival if the hotel is fully booked they will transfer you to another sister hotel across London and if your lucky pay for your taxi. Fair enough though they do print this in the terms and conditions so youre stupid if you dont read them!! 2) Non-flexible  After reading the flexible conditions we were not going to fall for that trap especially on such a busy night in London where the Hyde Park hotels would definitely be fully booked! We booked on the non-flex rate and paid a slightly higher rate (5). So we arrive at 1.30pm Sat afternoon and go to check in. Hotel exterior looks promising tree lined street leading down towards Hyde Park. Car park has smallest spaces ever; seriously if you have anything other than a smart car then its a write off! Reception although small was nicely decorated and pleasant. After giving our name to check in the young lady behind the desk looked like shed had a bad day and we were about to find out why. She informed us that due to maintenance work and water problems.our rooms were unavailable however she did say that alternative arrangements had been made at a better hotel so we werent greatly concerned. That is until we found out the alternative hotel was located at Holborn a couple of miles of the road. This was not an option as the whole idea was to book a hotel within walking distance of Hyde Park. The young lady recommended a bus to use as public transport (she clearly had forgotten that a 40000 strong crowd would have the same idea when the event finished). After much disagreement it became clear there was no maintenance issue at all and the hotel had clearly overbooked themselves. We were very unhappy and insisted it was the hotels responsibility to arrange alternative accommodation. The best they offered us was a free phone call to the reservations team (booking.com)rubbish. I insisted that the hotel was at fault and they find us something nearby whatever the cost (as they would be paying any extra on the room bill elsewhere). After speaking to the manager she told us to have a seat while she sorted it out. As a taxi driver arrived everyone who had been seated in reception got up got into the taxi/minibus and left. It soon became apparent that they had used this maintenance issue problem for other guests who arrived before us and sent them packing to the sister hotel which I assumed was previously empty! As soon as the reception had emptied we were called over by the hotel manager and given a room key.apparently they had shifted someone elses reservation out and made room for ours (maybe because we kicked up a fuss or maybe because they realised we had booked on the non-flex rate). The reception staff were polite enough but fairly unhelpful at first! Once through the maze of corridors it took to get to our room we were made aware of just how small this hotel is apparently it has 119 rooms but I think there are only 13 rooms here the building is just too small!! Rooms are tiny (cant be any bigger than 10 sq metres) bed touches 3 walls curtains dirty no floor space for anything but feet!! TV is awful its at a 90 deg angle to the bed you feel like you should watch it through a mirror on the wall! Now onto the bathroom.the smallest bathroom Ive ever seen. Reminded me of a hall of residence en-suite at university! Brushing teeth was a no go when you bend down to spit/swill you bum hits the door behind you. If you had more than a 36 inch waistline showers are also a no go zone! You simply wouldnt be able to squeeze past the aeroplane toilet-sized sink to fit in the shower cubicle let alone wash your hair!! The toilet didnt flush properly either. These are basics!!! Throughout our 1 night stay we must have seen 20-30 sitting in reception or outside on the steps waiting for taxis to other accommodation! I cant stress this enough Its a total CON and even if youre one of the lucky ones to get a room its 2 star at best not 4 star!! Another thing.there is no bar here the restaurant is very small indeed no way this hotel has 119 rooms!!! CON CON CON,baabaablacksheep_9

UR14152727,2008-9-March,I stayed there in March 2008 My first room 808 ----- billed as a double was a below ground postage stamp sized room requiring you to be a contortionist to use the shower and toilet. You could not open the wardrobe and bathroom door at the same time. The advertised in room free internet service was not available. I asked for a larger room and was promised a nice room. My second niceroom 815 while bigger than the first room this was again a below ground room at the bottom of the air conditioning shaft. The room was in a corridor used by the hotel staff at all times night and day. The tiles in the shower are falling off the walls.The television did not work for the entire three days although it was reported to front desk staff on multiple occasions I now understand while you are billed for your entire stay when you check in as you then become a captive.,barryt311
UR18710463,2008-7-August,This hotel is reputed to be a 4 star. We booked as a 'top secret' hotel through lastminute.com - after booking and finding out the name of the hotel I read the reviews on TripAdvisor and became anxious but decided to go anyway as the booking was paid in advance and I didn't have time to try and claim a refund. What's good about this hotel: - Near to Paddington and Hyde Park - Free Internet - Nice reception and lounge - It's a reasonable price for London but read the negatives What's not so good about this hotel: - Rooms are tiny and cramped - Bathrooms are small unvented and get damp - There is often no hot water - Poorly maintained i.e. broken light bulbs and a broken bed on arrival - the bed was not properly fixed - The phone in our rooms was wired in to the wrong room number so everything we tried to get fixed took ages due to the maintenance going to the wrong room - The simplest request i.e. for a bottle opener ended up in me going to fetch it for myself and then being asked to take it back! - Power cuts 3 afternoons in 5 The 'Shaftesbury' company has spoofed it's logo to look very similar to the Sheraton logo - but don't be fooled! This place is really only ideal for a single traveller who needs to be near Paddington for an early morning gettaway.,Fincher
UR14849210,2008-7-April,I booked a standard single room for two nights at this "fully refurbished" 4 star hotel. The first room provided on arrival had one remaining screw holding the door handle to the door. When I drew this to their attention they offered me another room. This had equally poor door furniture ungrouted tiles in the shower a bedside locker without knobs and drawers that did not open and several power sockets that were loose and not working. I was moved to their sister hotel around the corner where the standard was consistent with 4 star designation and where the staff were excellent. The emphasis /response in the first establishment consistently revolved around the provision of a "standard" room without any acknowledgement that that standard should be at least safe and habitable if not even in keeping with the number of stars awarded to the hotel.,callanan
UR17569056,2008-5-July,We were in London for less than 19 hours so we selected this hotel due to its proximity to Paddington Station... the stop for the Heathrow Express. Aside from the room being very small the shower's plumbing was totally messed up... either high pressure with ice cold water or a dribble of scalding hot water. Staff didn't even really know how we could access information regarding theatre shows and times. Seriously?! Hotel staff in London that don't have info about theatre times and tickets?! Yep. We found 'em. If we had been staying at the hotel longer than about 7 hours I would have demanded either a new room or a big discount. So if you've got a lot of money you want to dump on a small hotel room and you like cold showers I recommend this place.,chesterjibowitz
UR13274916,2008-5-February,I won't be coming back to this hotel. The elevator was so tiny that my boyfriend and I had to ride up separately because all of our luggage would not fit with the both of us inside. The room was not a deluxe as it had been advertised. There was about 2 feet of room between the foot of the bed and the wall. The air conditioning unit in the room is SO big that it takes up a lot of room. Thank goodness we were there in the winter as I would not be able to handle having to put the air conditioning hose outside and leave the window open(but that defeats the whole purpose of air conditioning to begin with!). The bathroom was small and the shower stall was even TINIER! The tap from the bathroom sink ran brown at first(and they call this a 4 star hotel?) but to my relief it eventually ran clear. The sheets were filthy! There were ALL sorts of hairs and crumbs in the bed! I called reception and the bellboy brought up new sheets but I ended up changing the sheets myself as housekeeping had gone for the day! I kept thinking "I can't believe I paid $132 a night to be my own housekeeper". The bed was uncomfortable and the bedding reminded me of the 80's with the brown foam blanket and sandpaper sheets. And the walls in this hotel are so thin you can hear your neighbor's TV and doors slamming. I left this hotel sleep deprived and extremely disappointed.,xtinasf
UR12284823,2008-3-January,Thought I would give my review on this hotel. Reason - because this is by far the worst hotel ever in my experience of staying in London Hotels! This should have been a great 20th anniversary weekend for me and family so we booked 2 rooms to accommodate us all. When I reviewed the recent comments on line I was a little concerned. However we decided to stick with this as it couldn't be as bad as some of the reviews!! Bad move! The hotel has an impressive facade but I am afraid the good points end there. At reception we were asked to pay our full bill in advance very unusual I thought especially since we had not even seen our rooms yet. But it gets worse and maybe the best thing is to bullet the comments I have to make: 1. Size of room - so small it was not big enough for a single bed never mind a double (and superior size at that!). There was approx 4 inches of leg space to pass the end of the bed. 2 Size of bathroom - how this got planning permission is beyond me. The room was about 2 feet in width so small that there was no room to bend at the washbasin. The shower cubicle at 2 feet square was just enough room to stand in although washing was quite difficult! The cubicle door only opened about 18 inches because this then clashed with the wash basin! 3. Towels - why was it so difficult to get towels in this hotel? No towels on arrival (pm). Initially had to request from reception. No towels again when we arrived back on the second day of our stay. Again needed to request these from reception! 4. Why does a double room have only enough coffee and tea for one drink ie one coffee sachet one tea bag and one milk! 5. This room was so tiny that the TV was in front of the mirror on the dressing table so not only could you not use the dressing table but you could not use the TV either unless you wanted to sit side on to the bed! 6. No storage space. 7. Fans very noisy immediately outside our bedroom window. 8. No dial tone on the phone. Our children were in a different room and on a different floor and we would have liked to have had the facility to communicate with them via the room phone. 9. The bed was very hard hence it was very difficult to sleep. That is once we had overcome the noise from outside the window. 10. Finally our discussion with the hotel staff regarding our concerns fell on completely deaf ears. It was as if they have had our money now they dont give a damn! Completely disinterested. The room we were in was 'M3' and on further inspection outside the room it was obvious that this was originally one room (door architraves still evident) which has now been divided up into 3 double rooms! I would like to say something positive about this hotel however given our experience over two nights and the reaction of the staff I cannot find one solitary thing. But I wish others all the best.,Noggin52
UR17319215,2008-28-June,I only wish I had reviewed tripadvisor before staying in this joke for a hotel. I stayed in room 309 admittedly from the outside you could never imagine what horror awaits you inside. It's all really been said. Stay here at your peril avoid at all costs etc etc believe me the reviews are spot on. I have never felt so angry and humiliated at what was supposed to be a nice wekend break. Someone said on here you would be more comfortable on a park bench I actually considered doing that how anyone can get away with charging good money for such a shoebox beggers belief !!!! What more can I say If your a Dwarf or a Sardine then this is the place for you but if you want to avoid disappointment then stay somewere else you have been warned!,Alan A
UR18204756,2008-24-July,We booked this hotel because of it's supposed four star rating. The price $350 a night was high but seemed right for a four-star in London. We booked a 'triple' for my wife I  and our six-year old and a single for my mother-in-law. The lobby was large and clean and well furnished and the check-in was smooth. The beautiful Polish girls who appear to run the place could not have been nicer. Our expectations rose accordingly. They were quickly dashed by the rooms. My mother-in-law's room was the smallest I have seen at any price anywhere in the world. It appeared to be a closet that had somehow had a room squeezed into it. The shower toilet combo was plainly designed for slim contortionists. I went to the desk to protest but all the singles were the same. The $280 a night we paid for it was robbery. Our room was marginally better. There were three single beds in it each one the size of a camp cot and about as comfortable. The bathroom was ludicrously small. The folding shower door was hung an inch over the tub so water went everywhere soaking all the towels and toilet paper right off the bat. The hand-held unit fell off as soon as we turned it on. Hot water came and went with some drama particularly for the person showering who alternately boiled and froze. When we got all three suitcases in the room we had to climb over the beds to get around. The AC consisted of a fan and an open window. The tiny TV picked up three blurry channels by virtue of a rabbit ear antenna something I have not seen for 20 years. Our son used the toilet as soon as we got there which immediately failed to refill. After a complaint to the desk a guy showed up to have a look. He looked a little dodgy so I waited to see what he would do as he lacked both tools and any sense of purpose. He waggled the handle a few times and opened up the back and peered at the workings plainly with no idea what to do. Suddenly he hit upon the solution - if the shower tap was turned on the toilet refilled. He grinned and shook my hand at this revelation "See fixed!" he chortled. I pointed out that this was a poor solution. He agreed visibly disappointed at my reaction and promised to come back and have another go. We never saw him again. I cannot imagine how this hotel achieved four stars. The judges obviously never went past the lobby. London is never a bargain but this place is ridiculous. Avoid.,ModBob
UR15268890,2008-23-April,Booked this hotel as a "Top Secret" through lastminute.com - however the hotel were selling it cheaper direct! Also I did try e-mailing the hotel three times prior to my stay for a 'request' but I didn't get a reply. Not much of a walk from Paddington station and the hotel is set back a bit from the main road. First impressions were good from the exterior and lobby areas. The receptionist was very polite & helpful and she upgraded us to a 2-bedded double room at the back of the hotel (in lieu of the request I e-mailed ahead for). As we approached the room both keycards failed to unlock the door. So I had to go back down to reception and after nearly breaking my neck on stairs that were not marked as you opened an interior door we were in. The bedroom area was quite spacious and relatively clean but no way was it decorated to 4* standards. The television was about 13" you literally couldn't turn around in the bathroom but the biggest problem were the windows. These were to be the culprits for keeping us up all night as they wouldn't shut properly and the wind whistled through. This hotel's only redeeming qualities were the comfortable beds and very friendly staff. Whilst we wouldn't stay again it maybe ok if you were allocated a bigger/newer room for a one night stopover.,toxKent
UR19065383,2008-18-August,at check in staff seems to be proffisonal they asked me to keep the my second bag in the luggage room and give me receipt for it. Then the ask for tips clearly. at check out time my bag disappear from the luggage room no one cooperate till i call the police. really i have been to different hotels in different countries but never i face this cheating. a case was filed against them and we will see what will happen. reservation was done through british airways.,victim999
UR16148359,2008-17-May,Pleasant exterior and smart reception mask what the rooms hold in store for the weary traveller. Told by helpful receptionist that my 'superior' room had been upgraded from a single to a double I eagerly made my way to see what treats lay behind the door. All I can say is thank goodness I didn't book a standard room! This 'superior' was tiny and I had to shuffle sideways around the bed to get to the other side to open the window in this airless cell. Pointless journey - the window was sealed closed so no prospect of fresh air. Reception advised that 'yes it was a superior room and no there had been no mistake yes I could move but the only available rooms were in the basement. No the windows didn't open but had I considered putting the aircon on?! No duvet just a blanket and sheets. No mirrors other than one in the tiny bathroom containing a shower cubicle that was built for extremely thin guests only. This hotel is a fur coat and no knickers establishment!,Chrix
UR22802317,2008-17-December,Booked as "Top Secret Hotel" though lastminiute.com. Was described as Chic and it could have been but was poorly maintained. Rooms were tiny despite being a de-luxe. Nowhere for towels or luggage. Bathroom had most of the grouting missing from the floor and parts of the walls. Shower tray and plug hole were grubby - but couldn't use then them much as there was no hot water! First night they told us to run the tap for 15 minute - but of course it made no difference. There was warm next morning but only just but by evening it was cold again! Lots of niggly little things at breakfast like - no coffee and then it was instants no white bread no marmalade poorly laid tables so had to ask for a side plates and salt and pepper. On positive side the rooms smelt lovely and the flowers in the public areas were beautiful but this was not enough to make up for the rest. And to cap it all they tried to charge us again for breakfast as we left even though we had paid up front when we arrived! I would definately not go there again.,maggiemayKettering
UR14951088,2008-11-April,This is a newly remodeled hotel situated about a 5 minute walk from Hyde Park located in Paddington. The rooms are extremely small but clean and modern. We had stayed in this hotel twice within a year and the (newly installed) air conditioning wasn't working either time. Despite the small and stuffy rooms we would gladly stay at this hotel again due to the low prices.,davidd98321
UR7284845,2007-5-April,Originally booked at the sister hotel Hyde Hotel Paddington I was surprised to find it was closed for renovations and my reservation had been changed (without notification) to the Hyde Park Paddington across the road and a block up the street. Beautifully and recently redecorated I was pleased they had my reservation and checked in. The room was small the bathroom even smaller but everything was going to be OK until I discovered there was no water - only gurgling and hisses from any of the taps. The front desk told me they were aware of the problem the plumbers were fixing it and water would be restored shortly. I went for a walk. The hotel is in a nice part of London Bayswater and very close to Paddington Station just a few hundred yards away so it was easy to take the Tube to the theater district Soho and stop in the many used books stores along Shaftsbury Avenue. I returned around 9 pm and discovered still no water and more ominously no gurgling or hissing. I called the front desk again and was told that the plumbing had been fixed and most of the hotel had water but it would take a while for the tanks and pressure to fill and reach the 4th floor. As I had to be at Heathrow around 5:30 the next morning I turned in. I was awoken at about midnight by a guest Japanese from the sound of it angrily complaining to a staff member about the lack of water and how unhygienic it was that he couldn't flush his toilet or wash his hands. I got up and checked - true still no water. I called the front desk and got a varying babel of stories about why there was no water and when it would return. I asked to speak to a manager and was told that they couldn't be disturbed - and this got my dander up. I asked what would happen if there was an emergency such as a fire (they would call the fire department - would they then call their managers? - probably not). I asked to change rooms to a lower floor where there was water (only now to be told that the entire hotel was without water) I asked to be relocated to another hotel with water asked for my money back nothing budged the 3-4 useless minions left in charge. In the distance I heard another guest yelling that there was no water. It was turning into a nightmare. So I was stuck facing two six hours flights the next day and a 5 hour layover in Toronto plus a two hour check in at Heathrow with fresh clothes but stinking like a homeless tramp. I really needed to clean my teeth - no luck. The coffee pot mocked me as I realized it also wasn't going to work. This was not my plan to finish my English trip with a stay in a three star hotel in the heart of London. Since when had London turned into a Third World country? The final straw? I figured that the toilet should have had one flush - from before the water disappeared and I chose the point to use the facility. The newly decorated bathroom was very small. and the toilet was situated in the small space between the very high-sided tub/shower and the bathroom wall. As I sat down I realized I was being squeezed into a space smaller than the worst economy seat on the smallest airplane you can imagine - Who designed this final insult? What building and planning commission had allowed this inadequate design? What hotel inspector gives out the three or four stars this hotel had proudly displayed when this is what guests are subjected to? After my trip I finally was able to get in contact with the booking agency who to their credit tried to obtain a refund from the hotel. Their advice I should have called that night and they would have re-booked me elsewhere. Great advice but I couldn't manage to make any international calls - perhaps my ignorance but perhaps long distance calls were blocked on the phone. Eventually after two weeks of trying to get somewhere with the hotel (and failing) the booking agency refunded my entire hotel bill themselves. I am grateful but realize that this hotel has no incentive to change or improve its service - they are still listed and still getting paid in advance reservations - and then they stonewall and try to avoid taking any responsibility for the substandard accommodations and service they provide. My advice - unless you are a gambler and figure this could never happen to you - AVOID THIS HOTEL. Final note - be aware that this same hotel property seems to be operating under varying names. The one hotel occupies several terrace houses on Wesbourne Terrace #78-82. In March 2007 the hotel had The Hyde Park Paddington above the door yet the hotel is also actively listed under the names: The Shaftsbury Hyde Park Paddington (perhaps a new name) and it can also be found under the name Hotel Senator (perhaps a former name). But it appears that you can book the hotel under any of these names. When googling this hotel to see if my experience was unique or not I felt that many guests were reporting a variety of problems on a number of sites under all the various hotel names. If I had read these comments in advance I would have booked elsewhere - but then I didn't know I had been booked into a sister hotel that was closed for renovation - is this all a scam to trap unwary guests? From the way the staff treated me and my complaint I would not be surprised.,Mike_from_California
UR6909464,2007-4-March,We stayed for two nights and my husband and I both agree that this hotel was a terrible value for our money. The room was like a closet and you couldn't even turn around in the bathroom it was so small. The walls were paper-thin. On our second night one employee was very nice and let us borrow a fan for background noise because we could hear the TV and people's conversations in the room next to us (they didn't have a U.S. adaptor for the fan I brought). The room was also cold so a portable radiator was in our room when we checked in (I don't know if all rooms had one or just some of them). I also don't know how standard cable is in England but we only had the standard 7 to 8 British channels. It was very convenient to the Paddington train station but we would never recommend the hotel.,PamboMaryland
UR8539395,2007-30-August,This is the worst hotel I have been to unless you like rude staff 7X7 (Feet) rooms with NO space to walk temperature around 40 C/100F inside the room no air conditioning and no windows that is. 4 stars? What a joke! Do yourself a favor go sleep on a park bench you will be happier and more comfortable.,mosaiko
UR7711335,2007-29-May,I normally check Trip Advisor before I book anywhere this time I forgot and am relieved that our experience at this hotel was no where near as bad as some of the previous reviews. I think part of the problem is that there appears to be at least two hotels with similar names in the same area I certainly got the wrong one when I searched for the hotel on Trip Advisor. Our room wasn't ready when we arrived at 3.30pm we had to wait in in reception but the staff were nice and asked if we wanted coffee while we waited. We were given an upgrade to a quad room on the 2nd floor which had two double beds in. It was nicely decorated but not partocularly well laid out. It was really hot and the air-con wasn't working the fact that you could ask for a fan from reception makes me think it's a regular problem. Everywhere was clean and tidy that we could see. The bathroom was laughable it was tiny you could go in through the door and turn round and that was it. The bath is quite high sided so you have to be very careful getting out We didn't have breakfast in the hotel as there are loads of little cafes in the area. I think it is an ok hotel for the money I paid I don't think I would stay there again though just based on the reviews of everyone else I think we might have been lucky to have had a reasonable stay.,Lucyep
UR8190508,2007-19-July,This hotel's in a nice tree lined avenue close to Paddington Hyde Park Queensway and Bayswater. The receptionists were no more friendly than absolutely necessary but no real complaints about them. The room (405) though was simply not 4 star; perhaps it was 2 star at a pinch. It would have been compact as a single but as a double it was pathetic. You can only exit one side of the bed as the other is against a wall. There is barely space to move around and the bathroom is so tiny that there's no space for toilet paper next to the toilet; it's out of reach by the far wall. Great if you've got arms like an Oran Utang ! It's as though the bedroom/bathroom were installed in a section of corridor. Oh and there were no towels in the room. Unfortunately the hotel was full so we had to put up with the nicely decorated but microscopic room. Good things are free mags and wireless broadband but it's only in the lounges on ground floor. The room was heavily discounted but GBP 99 without breakfast is way over the odds for this standard of accommodation. You can do very much better in the neighbourhood for the same money. No wonder the hotel can afford to discount rooms if they squash 2 people into a box ! 4 star - don't make me laugh !,Panopolitan
UR10113399,2007-18-October,We spent 4 nights at the hotel. When we returned on our last day our keys were demagnatized and had to go down to the desk to get new ones. We got new keys and went up to the room to pack. We found that an IPOD cell phone and a jewelry pouch were missing. We reported this to the desk and given a promise that management would contact us. It has now been 3 days 2 International phone calls and 2 emails directly to the manager of the hotel. Still no return contact from the hotel management!! All items would have been very small and easily removed from our room without notice. Someone obviously entered our room with a key during Saturday and removed the items. This would indicate that someone on staff entered the room with a key therefore invalidating our keys on return. The items were not laying out so they obviously had to search our bags to find them. The hotel was small clean with a courteous staff but was totally ruined by the theft incident.,TillyCincinnati
UR6599118,2007-15-January,This is an appalling hotel. Do not stay here. DO NOT stay here if you bring valuables with you to London or if you intend to leave your room unoccupied for any time as you don't know who would be allowed into your room by the front desk. DO NOT stay here if your health is important to you as you will be suffocated by the inescapable heat coming out of the vents. At first glance It appears lovely at first young staff etc... Then when you get to your room you realise how substandard it really is. First of all there is only one elevator and it doesn't work and I had to climb 4 flights of stairs with my luggage after a 9 hour flight. They didn't seem concerned about the inconvenience. Secondly the rooms are so tiny you can't get out of the bed without knocking your limbs off the edge of the furniture(I was told I had one of the better rooms when I checked in). Thirdly the rooms are like ovens. There is NO air conditioning!!!! You would think in London that this would not be an important feature because of the mild climate but the lights give off heat and the radiators can't be turned off there is heat blowing out of the vents and the higher up the floors you go the hotter it gets. It's stiffling...I had to borrow a fan from the front desk....it seems everyone had to do this. But it still was inadequate. Fourthly the safe doesn't work in any of the rooms. Same with other guests. Fifthly the showers have no power and are so weak you feel you haven't washed. Then a strange male guest walked into MY room one night when I was stark naked. The receptionist gave him MY room key without checking who he was just because he got his own room number wrong!!!!! When I complained I was told by the manager who was so young looking that he had no authority to help me that I would have to leave my contact details for the "real" manager when she gets back from her holidays!! I still have not been contacted by her. If its a relaxing break you want AVOID this hotel. The basic security and health and safety features are lacking and their patrons' complaints don't seem to be a priority.,Foleyka
UR8276758,2007-1-August,Given: The hotel apparently is under new management and is being renovated. Their letterhead now reads "Shaftesbury Hotel Paddington" The Good: Free hi-speed ethernet internet connection. Does flake out at times but otherwise reliable. There are computers in the lobby for those who forgot theirs or need to access the internet while someone else is using the room connection. Family Room (sleeps 4) good size for family w/ small kids or two couples who do not mind tiny quarters. Nice flat screen TV. A lot of fine places to eat in surrounding area including small shops to purchase cold items. Super convenient access to ATM and Paddington Station (rail and London Underground). You have access to underground lines: Hammerstein/City Circle and District. Downtown buses also terminate nearby. When exiting Paddington Station exit Eastbourne & Praed (do not cross Praed). Go to Westbourne but do not cross Westborne Terrace street. Turn right. The hotel not marked is on the same side of the street Only a 5-10 minute walk. The Bad: Family with teenagers -- especially one of each you'll end up with double beds. Apparently no twins available. Room so small you cannot get to the closet. Refrigerator almost out of the question. Ours did not work. Emitted heat that only compounded the temperature issue. Maid service -- diminishing towel replacement. Spent 5 nights each new service we were missing replacement towels and/or bathmat. Reception Staff only process in and out. Cannot (whether incapable or under instructions) answer many simple questions about the area. No free breakfast. No matter what their website will advertise plan on eating outside -- 10 for pre-order 12 for drop-in. Go down the street and enjoy the same advertised meal for 6. Restaurant only opened for breakfast. Did not see bar/lounge. Could exist on basement level as well. When receiving documents (fax) make sure sender instructs reception staff to alert you. Otherwise it will sit at the reception desk. The Ugly: When we were there humidity = 80-100%. No ventilation or air circulation. Hotel will offer stand fans but only good for small area. Really does not resolve discomfort level. No bathroom/shower exhaust. First one into the shower gets the best. Last one the bathroom is a steamroom. Did I say -- broken refrigerator? Family room good for two committed couples or families with small children who don't mind sleeping in the same bed. Families with teenagers beware. Mini spotlamps in bathroom sleeping areas and hallways. None help with the climate (extremely hot) nor environmental friendly. Would recommend to hotel to change certain area to florescent tubes would reduce heat and save energy. No garden. Views of street or back towards buildings and roofs. Elevators ("lift") only good for 6 people. Have luggage go in shifts. While there construction workers often took priority of the lift. Plan on taking the stairs of they are still working.,SFBayAreaTrekker
UR4447675,2006-8-February,Not a cheap place to stay. The bathroom is tiny and there was no hot water! Breakfast is great but you have to pay as its not included. Internet worked only through laptop. Couldnt get it working via their TV called them to come and have a look and they never did.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR5776382,2006-7-September,Although this hotel is not cheap in London you can't expect a large room for its fairly moderate rates. However it's fair to expect things to work. When I checked in I found that the safe didn't work there was no remote for the TV (so that didn't work) and the Internet connection didn't work. About the only thing that did work was the electric kettle and the phone which was a good thing since I spent a few hours on and off the phone with reception trying to get the various non-functioning aspects of my room fixed. They were polite I will say that but this hotel is not up to the standards you expect with its price. And yes the rooms are tiny and stuffy.,LaureneM
UR5423770,2006-4-July,I have worked in the hotel industry for 5 years and I know a little of what is done behind and on the front desk. Upon arrival the receptionist told us that he had no record of our booking. Then he told us that it had not been put in the system and the hotel was full and he would have to shift us to a different hotel. In hotel-speak this is called bumping and we only ever do it under the most extreme circumstances and only once in a blue moon - it's very bad practice! We were assured that this hotel would be close of a similar class and that they would pay for whatever taxi needs we had. Whilst we were waiting for a taxi two more people showed up and the same thing happened to them. It appears that the hotel chronically and deliberately overbooks its rooms a kind of 'bait and switch' method if you will to allow them to shift business to other preferred hotels in their group or otherwise. After waiting 20 minutes for this taxi I enquired as to why we couldn't take a taxi from the street as there were hundreds passing the hotel. I was informed that the hotel had a 'private car' service (read: hotel group has made a deal with a particular car company). In the end we had to wait 40 minutes for a car that we were told we would be sharing with the other couple. A word of advice: ask which hotel they are going to bump you to. If it is the Kensington International REFUSE. This is an extremely poor quality tiny old inn with the rudest manager on earth and it is in Earl's Court nowhere near the Hyde Park Paddington. I have no idea why they chose this hotel to bump us to since there were rooms available in several Paddington hotels. He put us in a tiny double room in the basement - literally we were below ground and the half-window looked into a wall. When we went back to reception to request a different room the manager became offensive defensive and aggressive. I called the HPP and told them that this hotel was not suitable. The receptionist agreed to change us again and again we waited 40 minutes for this private car to show up. While waiting I saw 6 other couples from the HPP arrive in cars at the Kensington International. In summary HPP hotel staff are completely incompetent the hotel they sent us to was ridiculous and unsuitable. The biggest problem is that having read the other reviews I suspect they have a policy which routinely allows for the overbooking of rooms in order to garner business for their other or affiliate hotels. This is dishonest despicable and unacceptable. Please stay away from this hotel unless you wish to spend 3 hours of your night waiting for cars and speaking to incompetent receptionists. A most unpleasant experience!!!,A TripAdvisor Member
UR4395123,2006-29-January,It failed in every respect. We had a most unpleasant stay. Extra bed shoved into room to make it a triple. Room tiny as a result. Bathroom like a phone kiosk. No response from reception. Stay away......,A TripAdvisor Member
UR5015772,2006-28-April,I didn't actually see any of the hotel other than the lobby. (Rather unfriendly). I went to The Hyde Park Paddington around 11am to drop off some very heavy luggage and said I would be back around 2pm to check in the staff I saw were friendly and I was looking forward to returning to the hotel to check in and freshen up before a long afternoon and evening out in London. When I returned just after 2pm to check in I was told the room I had reserved was not ready following some refurbishment work and they were transferring me to another hotel. At first I wasn't too bothered as long the new hotel was near Paddington Station as I had an early departure the following day (Sunday Marathon day!). The receptionist assured me it wasn't too far from Paddington. They were arranging a company car and driver to drive me to the new hotel to check in. I waited 25 minutes for this. When the car arrived I was whisked away and dropped in the middle of nowhere presumably near where the driver thought I was supposed to be going!! I looked around for 20 mins for the new hotel lugging my heavy luggage around with me. I couldn't see anywhere familiar and was stsrting to feel slightly uneasy about being in the middle of nowhere in a starng city. I found an apartment building with an open door and found a lady who was very kind and helpful gave me a yellow pages and telephone so I could call the Hyde Park Paddington to explain what had happened and ask where I should go from here. When I spoke to the receptionist I was made to feel like I was being a nuisance and couldn't beleive that there driver would dump me in the wrong place!! They took the address of where I was now and said they would send another driver to take me to the new hotel! With another 5 phonecalls......I eventually got to the new hotel 2 and a half hours later. Apparently they forgot to contact a driver to come and get me. I was absolutely mad and upset. I was in London for approx 24 hours nearly 4 of which I spent checking-in to a hotel. When I eventually arrived at the new accomodation Bridge Street Apartments who are nothing to do with HPPaddington but had a spare room I couldn't have been met by a lovely bunch of people and staff. They too had had real trouble with the HPPaddington I was not the only client to have been messed around and problems caused for. I would HIGHLY recommend my alternative accom Bridge Street Apartments. They managed to contact the HPPaddington and complain for me they have vowed never to have any further dealings with the HPPaddington. I advise the same.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR5833881,2006-25-September,The only real problem with this hotel is the lack of ventilation. In my six day stay the kind staff allowed me to change rooms three times. (tip: be nice to the staff and they will take better care of you) Central air appears to have been installed but is perpetually broken. The three rooms I was in were all hot and stuffy. There was no circulation at all none. From what other guests tell me it appears that one can't open the window in most rooms. Evey time I walked past the front desk there was someone complaining about the stained carpets funky beds lack of air conditioning windows that wont open hot stuffy rooms etc. London is an expensive city so you get what you pay for! ;-) Cheers!,hkbusinesstraveler
UR5702838,2006-23-August,My family and I stayed in a quad room at this hotel and it was horrible. The room was so small you could barely walk around the beds the bedspreads were stained there was no hot water they "forgot" our wake up call there were old shoes under the bed (not ours!) and the elevator was really slow. Oh yeah there were long hairs in the bed also not ours. Also the driver of the private car they arranged for our transport to the airport was very inappropriate with rude sexual comments and charged us 25GBP more than what was quoted (we didn't pay it). This was not an inexpensive hotel...a hard lesson learned.,Wanna-be-vagabond
UR5495958,2006-22-July,We booked a three-night hotel stay at the Hyde Park Paddington - this was thru BA in connection with our flight from Chicago on 16-17 July. I can't stress too strongly how very disappointed we were with the accommodations! It appears that only the very worst rooms are reserved for BA customers. Our ground floor room was a nominal 8 feet by 12 feet with a very uncomfortable queen size bed small desk and freestanding wardrobe 18 inches wide. Further there was only one tall and narrow window completely covered by dark draperies with no way to pull them back and allow light into the room. The window was sealed shut and considering that the air conditioning throughout the hotel had failed about the time we checked in there was ABSOLUTELY NO VENTILATION IN THE ROOM! The hotel did deliver a fan to the room at about 6 p.m. but in order to achieve any air circulation we had to prop the room door open with a piece of luggage. Needless to say we cancelled the remaining two nights of our stay and we also cancelled a separate booking we had made for members of our family residing in the UK. During our very short stay we observed 6 parties with confirmed reservations being told that there were no rooms available for them. These people were shuttled to the Best Western Paddington and told that they would be accommodated at the Hyde Park on the following night. We know from experience that the Best Western Paddington is not even a three star standard and it appears that one hotel is being overbooked in order to keep the other hotel occupied. One man returned to the Hyde Park to demand that his room at the Best Western be cleaned!,Sock's_Oma
UR4720825,2006-21-March,I arranged this hotel for my family and repayed through a travel agent. The lady of the agent said that she confirmed twice the reservation. My family arrived at the hotel before the check in time but they sent them to lower class hotel. We assume that they sent them because the visitor was Japanese and normallyl they do not claim (how did the hotel know it will be full before check in time??),A TripAdvisor Member
UR5358823,2006-18-June,We arrived at this hotel just after 2.00pm to check in and were advised that our booking that had been arranged 6 weeks previously could not be honoured. After enquiries we were informed that maintenence problems were the cause of this inconvenience. The hotel reception area was chaotic and staff dealing with our query answered telephone calls whilst talking to us - customer service was extremely poor. I had contacted the hotel only one hour before to reserve a parking space and had not been advised of any problems. I asked why we had not been informed of this during the phone call but no one could give us an adequate explanation. We were advised that we would be moved to a sister hotel in Earls Court. I explained that due to the fact that we were going to a concert that this was a major problem because of time factors. Hotel staff were unhelpful and acted as if the problem was not theirs to resolve. During the period that we were at the hotel we saw other guests checking into the hotel despite the fact that we had just been advised that due to maintenance problems no guests were being checked in. We asked the hotel manager if we could have any alternative rooms not affected by the maintenance problems. Initially he said he had no rooms available. Then he offered us one single room. Then he said that he had two single rooms available. Staff including the manager were giving us contradictory information at many points through our discussion with them. We asked the hotel manager if we could be given an adequate explanation of what the maintenance problems were but he refused to do so. We also asked if we could see the rooms that we would have been staying in - but again he refused. We advised the manager that we did not find this situation acceptable in any way and the manager asked us what he was supposed to do about that! As a result we had to agree to take transport to the sister hotel after the concert. We returned to the hotel only to be faced with having to explain the whole situation again to new staff. We were assured by staff earlier that transport would be arranged and that we would not suffer any further inconvenience. The members of staff we spoke to that evening had not been briefed in any way and to add to the problem the staff had very poor english which complicated the matter even further. Eventually we were able to arrange rooms and transport at the sister hotel. Unfortunately we then had to wait almost one hour for transport to arrive. The hotel did pay for transport to the sister hotel but we were then appaulled to find that the sister hotel - The Kensington International  4 Templeton Place Earls Court was not what we expected. The rooms were very basic with substandard bathrooms - e.g cracked sink washing up liquid in the soap dispenser and cigarette burns in the bath. The carpet in our room was stained in several places and the breakfast was poor - white toast only  cereal with milk that was warm. During discussions with the hotel manager we were advised that we would receive a discount of just 20% for the inconvenience. He assured us that he would arrange this and that the money would be recredited to us during the next 24hrs. When we returned to the Hyde Park Hotel to check this we were advised that this had not been done. Moreover when we asked for something in writing to confirm this we were also advised that this could not be done. We asked to speak with the manager once again and were advised that he was not available. Although the Hyde Park Hotel is clean and well presented the actual service provided does not match that image. All in all I felt that it was really very important to make other people aware of the truly awful experience we had. We thought that we had booked into a decent four star hotel that would provide us with comfortable and clean surroundings during our stay in London.The whole situation was extremely stressful and the customer service was without doubt the worst that I had experienced in a very long time.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR4359668,2006-18-January,I stayed here for three days & was given a large room with two queen beds. The internet was good as was the kettle the plumbing and the column heater. But I agree with others that the staff/management here were unfriendly & unhelpful. My son stayed one night & was given a tiny room one floor higher than the lift reached; there was no keycard for their room so they had to request at reception for staff to let them into their room - every time. Their shower didn't work & their beds were not good. All in all not a place to return to. Reception was constantly full of guests complaining & large numbers of staff - trainees perhaps -doing very little.,daytrippa07
UR4466002,2006-17-February,I stayed here for 5 days and thought I was going to be in for a lovely time how wrong I was Customer service was absolutely appauling No hot water for 5 days is one thing but not even having the manners to apologise for it is another. I have stayed in better run hostels then this it seems like no one cares about how the hotel is run. Try your best to stay somewhere else if you can,A TripAdvisor Member
UR5807159,2006-16-September,I stayed at Shaftesbury Hyde Park for just one night 15 September. To be fair to the hotel I didn't see much of it except for the lobby my room and the restaurant. The lobby is very clean but small so I wouldn't like to see it if a number of guests arrived at once. That said the reception staff were very good and I cannot fault them at all. Although the room wasn't ready when I arrived I still checked in but I didn't see the room until later in the day when I went back to hotel. The room was on the basement floor and was the smallest hotel room I've ever seen. Anyway I hadn't time to take it in as I had business to deal with elsewhere for the rest of the day. I arrived back at about 01:00am and that's when I was able to take this room in. Firstly the TV didn't work well exceptionally poor reception for local channels movies didn't work nor did the internet access. In fact there were no batteries in the wirelesss keyboard even if I did want to use it. A socket in the wall was completely smashed open - what if I or a child had put a finger into it? Anyway I was only going to be there till about 9:00am so it didn't matter. The bathroom was fine although very tiny. This is not a room for a large person which I'm not. I had prebooked a cooked breakfast. The restaurant was very clean and modern and well laid out with both continental choices and cooked choices. There appeared to be only 2 staff so attention to guets was minimal. I had to ask for the tea and toast and even then the tea was poured for me no teapot left so that I could use as needed. The cooked food was very nice looking and a good choice but either cold or not very warm. Poor for a 4 star hotel. I hadn't time to speak to staff about this but I left all these comments on a comments slip. One other thing - hotel get rid of the 'red carpet' at the entrance. It's grubby and gives a bad impression. Size of room and coldish food aside I wouldn't say to fellow travellers not to stay here. If I'd been staying longer I would not have accepted what I'd been given. Location to Paddington Station is very good my main reason for staying there was for a quick exit to Heathrow. Shaftesbury Hyde Park you have to do much better to justify your 4 stars.,Oakvale
UR5604720,2006-13-August,This was easily the worst hotel I have ever had the misfortune to stay in. My travel agent booked five nights in a DOUBLE room even though I was travelling on my own - as I requested a double and paid the extra. However after a 26 hours of flying I was given a single room which required me to walk through a sitting room and some service doors past what appeared to be the kitchens to a room that was so small the single bed hardly fit and the bathroom was a cupboard. It was filthy and the view of a brick wall really just made my day. I went back to reception and showed them the voucher from my travel agent with a double room booked but they said they did not hold a double as I was travelling alone. I requested a refund for the difference and they refused. After two hot nights (no fans) I could take it no more and left. I ended up staying at an excellent Holiday Inn at North Acton (near my friends) for around the same price. Sure it was a 20 minute journey via tube into Central London but it was an excellent hotel. Stay away from the Shaftesbury it is a mega dump!!!!!,Nitro2038
UR4971522,2006-13-April,I booked a triple room at this hotel through Central Reservations 5 weeks before my arrival. A 10% deposit was immediately charged to my credit card. Upon arrival we were informed that a triple was not available due to ongoing renovations at the hotel. They offered 3 single rooms instead. When I voiced my displeasure the front desk clerk became rude. The manager appeared and told me to take it or leave it. With my wife and daughter standing there I took the chance to call another hotel and get a room which I was able to do quickly. I asked for my deposit back and was told that it was not possible. In my many years of travel I have never encountered an establishment that cares so little about their reputation and clients. They could have informed me in advance of their inability to accomodate me so the inconvenience would have been minimized. A very unpleasant situation from a very unprofessional hotel,Davidfelsky
UR4452096,2006-10-February,I would avoid this hotel at all costs! I would stay in a private room in a hostel over this place - seriously! Main Lowlights: - A window that wouldn't close completely when it is at freezing point outside - No Hot Water for 2 DAYS! (without so much as an apology) - Problems with the toilets in a room on our level wich left the whole place stinking of sewage - a room so small that there was only a 2 feet walking space around the beds (twin room - complete joke) I couldnt believe the service here they told us to wait for the boilers to heat up - for hot water that never came. I had 22 hours of flying to do and after two nights with no hot water I was furious. The hotel manager was so lazy and disrespectful of their customers that he/she didnt even come in to the hotel when there were sewer problems and no hot water. tiny rooms noise from other rooms and street very apparent. The worst part however was the London mid-winter with cold air coming through the window and only one real hot shower during an entire one week stay. ...I think I have made my point...,elliefromwellie
UR3648913,2005-8-July,Hyde Park Paddington is in a great location! Just 2 blocks from the Paddington Underground/National Rail Station. The hotel is an excellent point to uses as a hub to see and travel within and outside of London. It is a short walk to a charming pub (The Pride of Paddington) and a few other places to eat an Internet cafe and is situated in a mostly residential neighborhood that is very quiet clean and safe. The photographs shown on the websites are terribly deceptive !! The rooms are very small and the bathroom is tiny...however if all you are using it for is to sleep and shower (which most people do) then that it won't be much of a problem but dont expect palatial accommodations. Still our room was clean and nicely decorated with a comfortable bed and adjustable lighting (which only operates when you insert your room keycard into the light switch). The hotel also offers a free broadband internet connection hookup which worked well for us. The property seemed well maintained but the elevator didnt work and the water in the bathroom was constantly at the extreme of freeing cold or scalding hot. In room phone calls are overpriced. Depending on how you made the reservation breakfast may be included but if it is not it is very expensive to purchase  which I do not recommend. The only thing I really did not like about the hotel was the rude apathetic and down right uncaring unprofessional staff. They ignored you would not answer questions or acknowledge you if you were standing at the desk and turn and walk away as you spoke to them. I had one attendant literally toss back my credit card to me when he was done and when I checked out I didnt get so much as a "Thank You" "Good Bye" How was your stay? or "Can I Call You a Cab?". All in all -despite the staff- it is a pretty good facility and good for the price but I do not feel that it earns anything near the 4-star rating as it lacks the facilities and service in my opinion that Ive enjoyed in other 4-star properties. I did enjoy my stay but I only slept and showered there. I would recommend the facility with the caveat of the abysmal staff. If it were not for the staff I would probably stay there again.,queenices
UR3847784,2005-7-September,Do NOT stay here! At best this is a 2 star hotel NOT the 3  to 4 star hotel that they claim to be. There was no air conditioning at the hotel (4 star hotels have air conditioning even in London) so we had to keep the window open and listen to traffic noise all day and night. This forced a move to a quieter room at the back of the hotel. Unfortunately the new room had permanent dirt splotches all over the wall and looked horrible. In both rooms and in the hallways the carpet was full of worn-in dirt spots that did not respond to cleaning and looked atrocious. The facilities are poor and the staff is unresponsive. The electric teapot in our room was broken so I brought it down to the front desk and asked for a good one. This was on Tuesday. On Friday after repeated daily requests for an electric teapot the staff finally managed to scrounge one up. The small refrigerator in our room never worked well but twice it stopped working altogether. Multiple requests for ice were ignored by the staff until we were finally informed that there was no ice (4 star hotels have ice its not that hard to get). Three separate times our electronic card keys for the door lock had to be re-made because the staff did not bother to look up or ask our checkout date and only issued the keys for 1 or 2 days each time. (A small inconvenience but easy to get right if you care.) On Thursday the lift (elevator) broke. These things happen but four days later on Sunday it was still not repaired. (4 star hotels repair their broken lifts.) We had to move many bags down three flights of very narrow stairs. Then the clerk kept me waiting to check out for literally five minutes while he ignored me and did his other paper work right in front of my face. Do NOT stay at this hotel!,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3646845,2005-7-July,I booked this Hotel via the internet and arrived to be told that they had 'overbooked' and they had a room for me in their 'sister' hotel a few minutes away. I was very unhappy but there was no compromise offered. I had to walk to the other hotel and the wasted time made me late for an engagement. The 'sister' hotel was dreadful. The biggest mistake I made was booking it before looking at the reviews on TripAdvisor.,PaddyBristol

But the best is the breakfast staff handling food with their bare hands & when caught not thinking there was anything wrong with that- Definately a hotel to avoid at any price!!!!!,HADRA
UR3741465,2005-6-August,Well what can be said that hasnt been said many times before. first a few good points. great location looks nice from the outside reception looks trendy and modern the room and bathroom was clean. the taxi they got me was a merc people carrier with leather seats and a smart looking guy with a blazer on made us feel important. in the file in the hotel room there was a cloth that really put a shine on your shoes. now for the rest!! Free internet didnt work repoerted to reception nothing done and they didnt seem to care either as it was 'a free service'. No it wasnt it didnt work. room decor was falling apart this was only 12months after a refurb!. i'm sure the web site states quality fittings think the must have mistyped this. the lift didnt work. had to go up in what must have been a baggage lift as was on the 6th floor and wife has walking difficulties. this lift was the smallist thing i'd seen in my life. the air conditioning didnt work and the room was so hot i thought i would melt. 4 hours after asking i did get a fan that only pointed at the floor but not to be beaten i balanced it on the sofa which you couldnt use as the desk was so close. walls very thin spent most of the night listening to the couple next door who were at it like newlyweds. the bathroom seemed even smaller than the lift although it did have a half bath in it which was very handy as you needed to put one of your bum cheek's on it to sit on the loo and you could have a wash whilst you were there as the sink was that close. I did have a bath though but the water pressure is so bad it took 55mins to fill it with water so hot you could boil fish in it turning on the cold tap made no differance as it came out slower than the hot. the taxi i liked so much was 20 to liester square the cab back was only 11 so to some it up the staff were unhelpful and spoke better spanish than english the room was hot and cramped.The air-con internet lift fan or the safe in the room didnt work. the taxi was a rip off. we couldnt sleep for the noise. The last straw was rushing home from the theater after watching les mis and arriving back at the hotel at 10.55pm to be told that they wouldnt open the bar for a last drink even if there was 5 mins till closing time. you would be better of staying in a nice 3* or even a cosy 2* than stopping at this so called 4* hotel the people that rated it must have been drunk when they did it.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3636188,2005-5-July,We had booked into the Hyde Park Paddington as we were going to the Live8 concert at Hyde Park and this hotel was in an ideal location. When we checked in they could not even find our name on the system...so we filled out a 'Check In' card then to be told that the hotel was fully booked and they were relocating us to a better hotel. Well this was fine...but the hotel was in Barbican at the Thistle Barbican - miles away! They said it was 5 minutes in a taxi - yeh right more like 30 - 40 mins. I shall give the hotel some credit in that they did put on taxis for us (although we could only use these between Hyde Park Paddington and the Thistle) and could only be booked through the Hyde Park Paddington and on most occassions turned up about an hour late...so a lot of our weekend was spent in taxis...which was why we had booked at the Hyde Park Paddington so we would could walk to the concert!!! We thought we were the only ones being shipped to another hotel...but we met at least 4 couples with the same situation. We found the staff to have a 'I don't care' attitude..quoting one of the receptionists "Well what do you want me to do about it"!! Other receptionists were laughing at guests when they were complaining! Great customer service. We cannot comment on the rooms - obviously but if first impressions are anything to go by I will NEVER book this hotel again and would not recommend it to anyone...all it has going for it is location...but that is only good if you are actually staying in the hotel! The Thistle Barbican was a great hotel but just no in the location we wanted to be! Sorry can't find anything good to say about this hotel.,Babbly66
UR4163872,2005-5-December,I read the reviews of this hotel about their overbooking problems but trusted it would not happen to me. I was wrong. When my wife and I arrived at the hotel at 0745 on the 14th of November we were told by the front desk clerk that our reservation booked through Orbitz was no good. We had no room. The city of London was in a sold out situation for all major hotels. Now instead of assisting my 8 month pregnant wife and I the clerk basically ignored us. I was forced to use my own cell phone to call the US to question Orbitz. The hotel refused to make the call. We spent 1 1/2 hours sitting in the lobby of the hotel before the clerk found us a room at the Abbey Court Hotel. I strongly urge not booking at this property! Horrible way to start the first vacation my wife and I had for 4 years!,flynfish777

UR3250892,2005-4-March,This hotel should be closed down! They do not operate in a professional manner and I was appalled on check-in to be told that I had been booked out to another hotel. The level of service I received in response to their error was appalling and I can not understand how they are still in operation. From the other posts the hotel seems to be a hovel anyway so I am glad I was shipped out. Mind you the alternative was a hovel too! Be warned!,Coolwaters
UR3980487,2005-30-September,I was told at arrival that the hotel was overbooked and I had to be moved to a "sister hotel" in Kensington. Was told that at the reception that the other hotel was only "10 minutes" away by taxi but the real distance was nearly 30 minutes. I had chosen this hotel for being close to Paddington to get to Heathrow with the express train service early next morning and lost a lot of time having to go from the other hotel instead. It seems risky to choose this hotel if you want a stay close to Paddington to get easy access to trains and Heathrow express.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3723131,2005-30-July,The Hyde Park Paddington Hotel may look nice on the website but I would advise you never to stay there. Put simply the service by the hotel staff was APPALING. In all my years of travelling I have NEVER been treated this badly especially by a "4 star" hotel. We were kept waiting an hour for the room despite arriving at the correct check in time and having confirmed that arrival time the same morning by phone. I approached the desk at least 4 times to ask when the room would be ready to be told rudely they would get back to me (which they didnt) or that it would be "10 minutes" (it was 1 hour). My parents in their 60's having just gotten off a long flight were falling asleep in the reception and not once did the staff approach us to appologise or even offer a glass of water. We had booked a triple room and when we were finally allowed into our room it turned out to be a double bed and a lumpy sofa bed not even a proper third bed. We complained to the staff who offered no explanation and certainly no appology. The website made no mention of a triple room containing a sofa bed. The staff at this hotel were rude uninterested and unhelpful. I was disgusted by the service and will never stay there again.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3097175,2005-29-January,When we booked a 4 stars hotel we didn't think we'd found anything like that. We arrived to the hotel at 13:00 and our room wasn't ready (although the check-out is at 11:00). The staff was rude and inpersonal. When we finally entered the room we find it was the smallest room in the world. We though it was a single room but after read the reviews I find all rooms are small. I couldn't open my suitcase without blocking the bathroom door. I've never been in such a claustrophobic room. The ventilation of the bathroom was inexistent and although it was January we kept the window open all day in order to be able to sleep at night. When we arrived the television didn't work neither the keyboard or the internet connection. Although we ask three times to th reception desk about the Interent connection and they tell us it was a free service the internet connection "ask us" to pay 6'95 pounds to use it. Never been so disappointed with a hotel!,Nu327
UR4067612,2005-28-October,The following email (to hotels) describes the problems I had in April 2005 which are exactly like so many others. The hotel manager promised to compensate but has yet to do so despite several follow-ups. I have reported the matter to the UK Department of Trade & Industry who have cited contravention of the Supply of Goods & Services Act 1982 that requires a "service be provided with reasonable care and skill". I intend to take it further and I suggest everybody else do the same. They cannot be allowed to get away with this. Email: "Dear Sir/Madam I wish to advise that I found my stay at the hotel mentioned below quite uncomfortable troublesome and overall very unsatisfactory. The trouble began on the first night when we were sent to a so-called "sister hotel" a few blocks away due to an overbooking at the hotel. The other hotel was not of the same standard and the room was actually sub-standard. It was only when we forced the issue that we were able to spend the remaining six nights at the hotel we booked. I feel that the staff at the Hyde Park Paddington Hotel handled this matter appallingly. However the main aspect of discomfort for our stay was the fact that the air conditioning was not working for the entire stay due to the refurbishment work not being completed. The room was extremely hot not unlike very hot summer nights in Sydney Australia. Having the window completely open and the portable fan running did little to alleviate this. Other factors I would like to bring to your attention are: * The room was located next to a service elevator which was very noisy throughout the night and early morning. * The room internet (tv monitor) did not work properly. * The hot water was often lukewarm apparently varying in temperature according to general usage within the hotel. * The door was not sealed properly and let in a lot of corridor light throughout the night. * One of the bed lights kept breaking down. * The room iron was useless (was not a steam type). All in all this does not accurately represent features of a supposed "first class boutique hotel" as you describe it complete with "luxurious features". I spoke with the General Manager of the hotel (John O'Neill) and he promised that some sort of compensatory refund would be forthcoming. Could you please look into this as a matter of urgency and ensure a quick and efficient response. Yours faithfully,Micwa
UR3612364,2005-26-June,What a way to ruin a stay in London. I had great expectations from this so-called 4 star hotel. It is dirty the carpets are filthy everything appears in a poor state of repair despite the fact that it is advertised as a newly- renovated boutique hotel. The rooms are incredibly small hot and not insulated. The noise from guests next door above and below are very audible. The hotel lacks any kind of professional standards. It almost appears that the owners/managers just don't care. I feel sorry for the staff who must continuely have to put up with complaints.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3088751,2005-26-January,Don't believe a word of what you read on this hotel's website. They list king size beds they don't have them. They list a mini bar and complimentary bottles of water they have an empty fridge in the room. They list themselves as a "4 star boutique hotel" but I can assure you this is nothing close to that as best as I can tell they made that rating up. Upon checking in the first night they sent us to another hotel to a room with a tiny bed flimsy blankets with ugly stains and a mildewy shower with intermittently hot water. The next day they feigned surprise at our dissatisfaction gave us free breakfast (whoopie) and told us we could move back to the hotel. This room whilst cleaner had only one thing true to its site- internet in the room. No king bed no 4 stars and let me tell you no quiet either. You might as well be sleeping in a dorm room with all the other guests for all the noise. (we could hear our neighbors cough/talk/walk it was that bad). The ONLY redeeming quality this place has is the fact that it is 2 blocks from Paddington station.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR4050626,2005-25-October,The following is a copy of an e mail i sent to the web service who mailed me to check up on my experiences at this hotel : Good morning Yes I will happily tell you of my experience at the Hotel Hyde Park Paddington. I arrived in Heathrow on the overnight flight from Miami tired and looking forward to a good sleep. On arrival in the hotel I was met by a scene of utter chaos that would make faulty towers appear like haven of tranquility. There was a crowd of about 12 people all complaining about different things. While I stood there two different couples slammed their keys on to the counter there faces flushed with pure anger shouting about the fact that they could not even check out because of the incompetence of the staff. Another American couple beside me was trying to explain to a female staff member who was had about as much English as a parrot where the Royal Albert hall was and how do they get there. When I eventually jostled my way to the desk they said that I did not have a reservation. As I tried to explain that I did she was distracted by some one else who needed attention more then me. As I stood there dreaming of a bed I was eventually told to sit down while they investigated. After about twenty minutes it became apparent that the only things that were being investigated where the broken lift the fact that they could not find any reservations and where this mysterious place called the royal Albert hall was. Despite the fact that I had a pre paid reservation I decided that it would be a more sensible option to cancel my date in London that night and get the first available flight home. I walked out the door boarded the Heathrow express and got the first flight home to Dublin which incidentally cost me over 300.00. This was a small price to pay to escape what can only be described as a scene as disorganized and chaotic as an A and E department in Saigon in the late 70s. During my train journey home I reflected on the fact that it does not all ways pay to try out different hotel web sites because as the old saying goes if it seems to good to be true it probably is. I travel regularly and will be returning to hotels.com secure in the knowledge that if you have found a professional hotel booking service its better to just stick with them. I have no doubt that other hotels on your site are superb and the whole booking procedure was simple. What I would suggest is that you remove hotels such as the Hotel Hyde Park Paddington from your site because one thing that I can guarantee and that is that every single person at that reception felt the same way that I did. I look forward to hearing from you Kind Regards Brian OConnor,ivorlittle
UR3402946,2005-25-April,I have just returned from a weekend in this London Hotel I booked a room for 4 adults. When we arrived and given our room key I and the rest of my party were in total shock of how small the room was. It had two single beds pushed together with NO room to walk past the end of the bed (you had to climb over both beds to get to the other side of it). On the upper floor was a bed settee and a dressing table that you could not get to because the bed was in the way. The bathroom was tiny you could only just sit on the toilet seat if you were a large person you would be well and tuly wedged in! The heat on the landing was stiffleling. The dinning room was also small and there were never enough knives and customers and staff were always bumping into the back of you. How this hotel is a 4 star I will never know. VERY DISAPOINTING.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR4255316,2005-21-December,my wife and I stayed at this hotel over the summer. the day we got there we had to wait at least an hour in the lobby before we could go to our room although it was check in time. when we finnaly made it to the room it was a shock; I had a feeling that I has to seep in a walking closet. The bed was unconfortable and the ac did not work for the duration of ou stay there. do not even mention the bathroom it is so tiny that two people can not be inside at the same time. on a positive side the staff was pleasant although we had to wait at least two hours for a shower cap to be brought up to the room. it is definitely a 2 start hotel Since they advertise the hotel as a 4 start I am still looking for the other two stars.,edcaraba
UR3984232,2005-2-October,Yes the rooms are small (but I've seen smaller) and the breakfast was nearly 10 pounds a piece but my main complaint is that when we arrived (after a long airplane ride) we were told they had no room for us. We then had to take a taxi to their sister hotel (a MUCH nicer hotel btw Shaftesbury Kensington). Yes they paid for the taxi but now we were miles from the Paddington Station where we were to take the HEX next morning. They suggested we take the tube to Pad. Sta. but we are 60+ yrs old with luggage. Finally I took off my coat and told them I wasn't leaving (I never raised my voice or spoke discourteously to them nor they to me). The manager was called and they agreed to pay our taxi fare to Pad. Sta. the next day. While we were there two other couples were also denied rooms for which they had reservations. And the lift was still out of order and it has apparently been so for two years! I wouldn't book a room here again.,kifu
UR4249549,2005-18-December,On arrival the hotel appears to be a sophisticated and friendly establishment but don't be decieved! My partner and i stayed here for two nights as an anniversary treat before christmas. The location was an attraction but we were led to believe from the hotels website that this would also be a romantic place to stay the rooms looked spacious and comfortable with the hotel offering plenty of bonuses. After we struggled to pull our cases through the most narrow corridors we'd ever seen we entered what was the smallest room we've ever stayed in a box room would have been spacious compared to this. As a result we had no room once we'd found a space for the suitcase. Our kettle was broken and so we couldn't even enjoy a drink whilst we tried to manuver ourselves around the room. We had no duvet just a flimsy throw and a single white sheet which was made worse at night by the fact that the windows do not fully shut and aren't double glazed. My partner is a sound sleeper but even he couldn't make a full nights sleep with all the noises you here. Not that this is a particularly noisy place to stay but when your walls are made of cardboard you tend to notice EVERY little sound. So it was an unpleasent nights sleep for us both when we heard partygoers arriving back at 3am and the guy next door having a bath at 6.15 on a sunday morning!!! We had included in our price a full english breakfast but on arrival were told it would only be a continental and we'd have to pay 5 extra each to have a cold fry up! it was only when my partner took our printed recipt as evidence that they supplied us with this disapointing luxury. To top all of this off when we arrived the bulding site outside the hotel left just enough room to park our car in a very narrow space and pay 15 a night for the pleasure of it! It was only after we accidentally left our winge list lying around when we went out for the day that we arrived back to find the list gone a new duvet new kettle and an electric heater.( As there was no heating in the room because the electric control on the wall was broken but they had been kind enough to supply a fan what one wants with this when it is 3 degrees outside in december is beyond my kmowledge.) So i would advice you winge if you want anywhere near a warm stay. Also the electrics in this building were appaling the lights flick on and off continuosly and every time they do so does the tv!! The two good things i can say about the hotel itself is that it was clean and the staff at reception were friendly. So overall? DON'T BOTHER WASTING YOUR HARD EARNT MONEY IN THIS DUMP.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3276502,2005-16-March,We had a group booking but when we arrived after checking in we were told there was no water so we could not even flush the toilet! The problem had occured the day before but they had not rung to advise us or tried booking us into another hotel they gave us a map and told us which direction to head in to find another hotel if we did not want to stay. They were offering us a free breakfast the next day but who wants to be served breakfast when the staff cannot even wash their hands before preparing the food? In the end we stayed at the Royal Eagle around the corner which was small but clean and confortable and they had water! Would not recommend Hyde Park Hotel. Very poor service.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3009996,2005-16-January,I agree with all the other reviews - please do not attempt landing at this property! My fellow travellers are right on the money with their description and experiences at this hotel. I can't believe I got suckered in to their cheap price for a few nights in December 2004. It is definitely worth spending the extra dollars for a decent and comfortable night's sleep somewhere else. I normally research all my hotels on this site but opted not to for this one. What a huge mistake! My room was miniscule mildewed hallways were run down carpeting threadbare I'm certain my bed had bugs in it and I did not feel safe and secure at all. I really felt the front desk staff would come and rummage through my belongings when I wasn't there. This place still gives me the creeps and I have nightmares from it. I totally empathize with the previous reviewer that wrote he couldn't talk about it until now. My fellow travellers this is not an overstatement! I had a 2:00 p.m. flight to catch the next day however checked out at 5:00 a.m. because I couldn't sleep and opted to wait it out at Heathrow. That's how awful it was! As others I felt compelled to add my story. Please do your research and stay at another property. I would not recommend this property to anyone even my worst enemy.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3892099,2005-10-September,We had already booked this hotel and were very nervous after the bad reviews. We arrived there and were told that they had a computer problem and overbooked. They were going to send us to their sister property Earl's Court Hotel. While waiting there was a sign that they were remodeling and some rooms didn't have airconditioning. I asked the desk clerk and she said that at this time none of the rooms had air. At the same time a guest came down and asked for a fan because his room was stuffy. They barely responded to him. Also we were there on August 24th and the lift was not working. The property that they sent us to was FABULOUS! I truly feel that we were so lucky not to have had to stay there!,PokerCPA
UR3653701,2005-10-July,As part of my job I end up staying at hotels all over the place and I encountered the Hyde Park Paddington a few weeks ago. I thought that booking it through the internet was an easy experience and booked one of the 'Duplex' suites. I arrived at the hotel with my car and the staff arranged for a space for me (at a 15 charge) at the front of the hotel. I checked in without incident but it would have been faster if more staff were around at the time. My 'Duplex' suite was very small - don't believe the hype on the website... As soon as I walked in there was a door to my right that was the bathroom. Now I have been in some small bathrooms and it is called the smallest room in the house - but this bathroom was so tiny that my knees almost touched the hand basin when I was sat on the loo! Then there were some stairs to the left of the entrance door and these led to the seating area. I thought that it would be the bedroom upstairs as the photo had shown on the website but be warned - all that was up there was a two seater sofa and a kitchen-unit type thing with a microwave and fridge. Downstairs was the bedroom and this was so cramped that you could barely move at the end of the bed which was where the small wardrobe and dressing table was situated along with the television. You couldn't even sit at the chair as it could not pull out far enough because the bed was in the way. I didn't eat at the hotel but I visited the 'bar' which was poorly staffed (hardly spoke English) and very expensive. (2 drinks were over 8.00) The hotel was very busy and quite noisy along with it. You could hear the people in the rooms next door and opposite which meant a restless few night's sleep! I could hardly believe that the place had such bad sound-proofing. When I checked out I picked up my car which had been in situ for 4 days and it was covered from top to toe in tree sap and leaves not good when turning up to a client site! Overall my stay was unsatisfactory and I know that there are better hotels in London that will charge a lot less for more space and better service.,Kaygee
UR2871294,2004-8-December,I was a penny wise and pound truly dumb this past weekend. I was traveling on personal business and did not stay at my usual hotels The Montcalm SAS Portman or The Churchill. I was picking up the tab....so I thought a 4 STAR hotel near Paddington for $180 a night.... great. My first room....let's not even discuss ....the dirt under the bed (I put my suit case under the bed and whe I pulled it out IT WAS DIRTY)...I am a healthy male not fat but I could not fit into the shower. ....do not book this hotel no matter what the rate is. Rude staff poor housekeeping etc. I felt like it was the guest vs the staff. This place does should not even be listed as a hotel....but a dump.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2504289,2004-31-August,I can hold my hand up and say that I'm one of those that was duped by the hotel's own publicity. I booked through Expedia expecting a spacious room in four-star surroundings. What I got was the smallest hotel room I have ever stayed in (that's not exaggeration) fitted with pretty standard furniture an equally tiny bathroom and air conditioning that didn't work. I always try to see the good aspects in a venue but I'm not joking when I say the only good things about this hotel are the lobby and the location. It looks impressive when you enter but then you get dispatched to your room... Oh my. Tiny corridors (and I'm not a big person) lead to tiny staircases which lead to tiny rooms. Maybe if you get a family room or suite the size is okay but regular/double rooms are appalling! You walk in and within two steps your feet are touching the bed which is wedged up against the wall. This means if two of you are staying in the room one person has to climb over the other just to get out of bed! The hotel did provide a fan - because the air conditioning wasn't working months after being installed - but that just took up more room. It was impossible to open the closet door or sit at the desk because of the lack of space. The bathroom was equally atrocious in the lack of space. You can sit on the toilet and without moving an inch can wash your hands at the sink turn on the shower and get a towel off the towel rack because the space is so cramped. I didn't speak to the staff mostly because I was sulking at having been deceived about the room! I can't stress this enough: DON'T TRUST the hotel's listings on ANY website. The other reviewers here are 100% right. Stay away and if you've already booked CANCEL!,washdctravel
UR2898581,2004-18-December,Very very small room. 4 stars must be a joke! You should not select this hotel! Their reduced price marketing is just a trap.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2705152,2004-15-October,We booked a room which was decribed as spacious. After checking in we were given a TINY room. In fact there was no room for our luggage which we piled up in front of the door. Additionally the staff were all very young probably students. They really did not give a s**t about the guests. Stay away at all costs!!!!,JaywTucson
UR2825604,2004-15-November,Avoid this hotel like the plague! Rooms in Tokyo are suites compared with these cramped singles where you can't open a suitcase and if you drop the soap in the shower you can't bend over to pick it up. Unfriendly staff unreliable wake-up service; you name it to make the hotel an unpleasant stay despite their new handsome appointments.,matteoricci
UR2816869,2004-10-November,This is a terrible hotel if it can even call itself that. The room i had was incredibly small. barely enough room to squeeze in around the bed. the ensuite was a joke. so small and poor. depressing to talk about. the general service was poor. they didnt understand half the things i said to them. you would thing you were in eastern europe. Breakfast was just ok until i found out that i have been charged an extra 2.50 for the fry. Just not up to scratch. Very similar to a very poor B&B if even. Im just appalled,A TripAdvisor Member
