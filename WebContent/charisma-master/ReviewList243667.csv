UR124292451,2012-8-February,On arrival after a long journey from Paris we went to check in in we noticed unattended luggage in and around the reception area and security not bothering to do anything about it when we got to the room on the fourth floor we found it to be already occupied by someone else we went back to reception and they rectified it by giving us another room on the fifth floor where there were lots of noisy foreign teenagers rampaging around. In the second room the toilet was blocked full to the top we had to move a third time before settling for the night. The room was grubby and dirty the bathroom was tiny the shower didn't function correctly - all in all the whole place is a dump and I definitely wouldn't reccomend going there. We made a fuss and were given a refund in the morning befor we left.,carl s
UR124189091,2012-6-February,Stayed here for one night with my wife and 3 year old daughter for our first trip to london after a long day sight seeing we checked in . As soon as we stepped through the door i was dissapointed. and it imidiatley put the dampener on our weekend We paid 89 pound for what was supposed to be a triple room what a rip off !  i have stayed in bigger single rooms. The room was so small we couldnt fit our push chair in it the three single beds were uncomfortable with just a plain white sheet and no bedside table the floor looked dirty the bathroom was in need of replacement and had black mould everywhere you looked the bedroom had bits of wet toilet paper stuck to the walls and ceeling and crayon marks all over the walls the curtains were half a foot shorter than the window.to add to this there were a group of rowdy yobs on our floor shouting and swearing and being verry aggressive in the corridor at regular intervals between 12 am and 5 am. this woke my daughter up 3 times and made us feel unsafe. This should not happen in any hotel and they should provide security to deal with them. iI have stopped in travelodges in other cities before and you usually get a good standard so why does london have to be so poor if i had paid 10 pound for the room i would still be dissapointed.,60danielb
UR124114522,2012-4-February,Book this hotel on a super saver for 19. Don't get me wrong I am realistic and don't expect much for this price but I expect much better than what it was. Checked into the room at 1 after paying a 10.00 charge (which i didn't mind) to find the filthiest room ever!! There was wallpaper hanging off the walls ceilings were black bathroom was revolting there was mould in the shape of soap on the unit. No iron.... The worst was it was so filthy I developed a rash on my body. I went to reception to complain and the girl said "oh well what do you expect" NOT HAPPY!!!,KaiEvs
UR123914320,2012-31-January,I would recommend Travelodge in general having stayed in and been perfectly happy with many of their hotels in the past. However this particular Travelodge is pretty disgusting. The corridors absolutely stink of a mix between wet dog and cabbage. The whole place is completely battered unclean and stinking to the high heavens. The breakfast was dire and one of the cleaning staff let themselves into my room at 10am when my partner and I were still in bed. Poor show Travelodge - absolutely pitiful hotel!,FayesieDaisy
UR123877138,2012-30-January,Stayed here with my friend in January and the room was absolutley terrible! There were peoples nail clippings on the floor and hairs all over the walls! The duvet was so thin we didnt even think there was one there until i pulled it back!! And the tv wire was all cut open...dangerous!! The mugs were filthy! covered in coffee stains! wouldnt want my worst enemy to stay here!!!!,angeleyesjo
UR123747379,2012-28-January,My god where do i start...worst hotel i have ever encoutered but seeing as previous reviews have not been replied to i doubt they care about their customers but i will write this review to save others the heartache of staying here. Got tickets as a present to go to london for 3 days so booked here as if seemed central. Paid 300 for the 3 nights. Hotel is in a very rough and ran down part of London. Room was tiny and tired lookin..no shower gel or shampoo which you would expect even in a b&b. Decided to eat here the 1st night...i had goujons for starters which were burnt black and served on a tiny side plate..then had fish which was frozen and watery..told the manager it was horrible but didnt even get a complimentary tea/coffee..on departure was not even asked was our stay ok..could write more but just havnt the time..discgrace of a hotel in this modern age.,28happycamper
UR125274200,2012-27-February,Hotel is an acquisition without any clear brand or identity. My room contained dirt shadows where once furniture light fittings shelves and the missing trouser press existed in the past as well as mildew/fungus in the bathroom. So this would suggest that the room has little attention. This hotel is a shambles and speaks of a job 1/5 done. I would not stay here again. Much improvement required across the whole hotel. Paid 120 GBP for a double room this was not good value for me. Try elsewhere would be my advice unless pay a lot less..,Trade2012
UR125236001,2012-26-February,To be fair we were looking for a budget place when we booked this "hotel" however we weren't expecting such a shabby mess. The reception area is like a cross between the police precedent in Robocop and the cantina in Star Wars its loud constantly busy and if you have a problem with your room you had better expect a long wait. The room was basic which is what we expected. We didn't expect the 'matter' flicked up the walls the soft lumpy bed the dirty soiled smelly bathroom and the unclean window. The only plus was that the room was quiet even though we were on a thoroughfare. However in the morning from about seven we had to put up with constant noise from the hall as the very long cheque for breakfast passed our room. All in all a god awful place that doesn't even fit the remit "cheap and cheerful" with a million budget hotels in London we made a bad choice with this one. One to avoid at all cost.,Neilkent100
UR123499757,2012-23-January,One of the cheaper options in central London it shows all the signs of a high volume quick turnaround low maintenance establishment. The staff were pleasant enough but service is minimal. Checking in at 12:00 required an extra payment of 10 although the rooms were clearly available and ready.(The option of dropping off our bags in the luggage room also cost 10!) The rooms were well-worn and the whole place could do with a make-over. We only booked a week ahead so a double room was 70 for one night. Although it is on the Kings Cross Road its a good 10 mins walk from the station.,njord
UR126427850,2012-21-March,Travelled with a group of adult students and everybody was disgusted with this place: Screaming and shouting younger students in the hallways - no sound-insulation what so ever so anyone passing your door will sound like they are actually in your room. Security randomly knocking on doors at 1 a.m. trying to find the rascals. Half an hour breakfast-slots operated by the principle that the ones who check in first get to choose time-slot first resulting in us having breakfast at a time totally not suited for us. Breakfast variety was fine though. The beds are worn and have bad springs are uncomfortable and some are really noisy. The paint is peeling off the walls and the plumbing is bad - it takes forever to get the shampoo out and when someone's showering in another room the pipes are moaning. Our room was OK after cleaning however there were body hairs on the bathroom floor behind the door when we first arrived and they never moved... One day there weren't towels after cleaning the other day there weren't toilet paper. No phones in the room so one must go down to reception to organize these things. Altogether: Too much hassle compared to the price we paid.,FlyinBee
UR122426772,2012-2-January,stayed here as it was one of the only places that had availibility on NYE. However wouldnt stay again rooms are tired looking and smells a bit musty.the staff were sweet but ive had a lot better from other travelodges...,Dan S
UR124026651,2012-2-February,I stayed here on a two night trip in January 2012 and was grateful to come back home! The cleanliness wasnt very high with hair still in the bath tub and a pubic hair in the sink. The building obviously has very old plumbing as the pipes made very strange noises throughout the night with the walls being very thin this became very tiresome at 4am in the morning. It seems that this particular hotel is also very popular with school trips with many hyper studnts running the corridors late at night with a rather relaxed and unprofessional security guard that at one time could be heard telling people to shut the [--] up. Breakfast was a poor show too with sausage reconstitued scrambled egg tomato bacon and beans looking as though they had been out for several hours. Not very appetising at all. despite this poor reveiw i will still be using travel lodges in the future just not this one! I would avoid this hotel at all costs if possible despite the low costs i would recommend spending slightly more to get better quality.,amy f
UR124711441,2012-17-February,Dirty dark and old. Needs a facelift and double glazed windows! Kept awake most of night due to traffic. Good location though- just 5 minutes walk to station.,Becky19845
UR123129396,2012-15-January,A bit grubby and tired looking on the outside do they ever get the windows cleaned interior has seen better days chipped furniture light fittings missing parts no bathroom fan(this is a mandatory requiremenr for bathrooms without a window) just the hole where it once may have been. Missing sink plug and a dodgy mixer tap that was either very hot or very cold. The TV worked but who knows what the programmes were. Evidence that once upon a time air conditioning existed now just an electric storage heater. Surprisingly good towels clean and fairly comfortable bed. Howeverfood at breakfasr was adequate but the evening meal I had was poor quality frozen fish peas and chips did not eat there again. This could be a showcase hotel if it was brought up to modern expectations but it did what it said on the tin cheap but not so cheerful  wont recommend or return to any Travelodge again they do not live up to their publicity.,PugwashEdinburgh
UR124573396,2012-14-February,We only needed a room for one night and that was enough! The room was very basic. It was clean but the grouting in the bathroom needed some attention. The bathroom was tiny and the shower head had a life of it's own spraying the whole of the bathroom!! We paid for breakfast which was warm. I wouldn't recommend this Travelodge.,Linda D
UR125981301,2012-12-March,Second nd thrd nights locked out of room and had to return to reception to get card reset. fourth night got into room to find glasses had been taken away and not replaced so had to return to reception to get fresh glasses. No extractor in toilet a/c broken exposing wiring. TV rwemote didn't work properly subtitles on and couldn't switch off no digital chanels poor reception. Cooked breakfast poorest I've ever had sausages some white scrambled crap that might have been eggs tomatoes and beans. Last day no spoons for cereal I asked for spoons waitress went and returned with teaspoons. Asked for full size spoons after anbout 5 minutes she returned with 1 spoon. Asked for another (with partner) after a couple of minutes I noticed partner was eating her fruit stuff so abandoned hope of getting another spoon - she was using a fork. Reception area dirty kettle in room made a nise like it had an electrical fault but hitting the plug hard seemed to fix it. Room was clean and bed made every day Just noticed someone reviewing this hotel having got rooms in a 19 sale. that would be a fair price,kiltedladdie
UR124476784,2012-12-February,full of students running around in the corridors all night so that no one could sleep & no phones in the room to call reception. took 15 mins to pull our cases there from the train station. i went to the room i was given and as i opened the door a naked man dived onto the bed and shouted i screamed someone disappeared behind the door. i went back to reception to ask for a different room as there were already naked people it that one. got a slightly better room on the first floor but we could ony get to it by stairs so more lugging of suitcases. bar area very much a cafeteria but pizza was ok.,hooleyholmezonhols
UR125946703,2012-11-March,Stayed here one night for a conference nearby and I'm glad it wasn't my money that was wasted. A work colleague tried to book our rooms on the Travelodge website and the best rate on offer was 125 three weeks in advance of our stay. We ended up getting an 85 rate on Travel Republic. The only good thing about this place is the friendliness of the staff. Without exception they were among the most cheerful I've ever met - including the two massive 'bouncers' who patrolled the reception area morning noon and night. Why they have to be there on constant guard is another matter. I suspect it's something to do with the hotel's frightful location. Breakfast was good too but that's where the positives come to an end. The most important factor - the bedroom - was horrible. Peeling wallpaper graffiti lights not working no shampoo etc. There's no way this place was worth the 85 my company paid for it. It's barely worth the 19 some people manage to get rooms for by booking months in advance. But perhaps the most telling thing about this property was the fact that it was swarming with secondary school students who clearly couldn't care less what their surroundings were like. I suspect they're the mainstay of this hotel on a regular basis. I also suspect they're the hotel's principal source of unsung graffiti artists. Which in its own way summarises how this particular Travelodge is more hostel than hotel. It's just a pity it wouldn't do the honourable thing and stick to hostel prices.,LondonKairos
UR123988231,2012-1-February,I booked a weekend away in London for my wifes 30th birthday. I booked our break as a package so was limited to a couple of hotels. When a Travelodge came up as one of the options I was quite pleased as you tend to think of Travelodges Premier Inns etc to be basic but modern and clean. How wrong could I have been!Everything that we saw from the moment we arrived just looked old and tired and uncared for. I hear this used to be owned by another company but that is inexcusable. How a huge company can rent out accomodation in this state is unacceptable. It should be shut down for a total refurb.As we walked through the hotel we could see tired decor and paintwork chip off of door casings and dirty windows. First impressions of our room (room 677) werent bad but when we took a closer look were disgusted. There was plaster and wallpaper peeling from the walls and the walls and ceiling had been sloppily painted with paint on door casings and plug sockets. Upon complaining I was offered a look at another room by the receptionist who said I would 'like the other room better'. Is that an admission of how bad the rooms are? Needless to say we got a full refund and checked out immediately. We will never use Travelodge again.,Sean H
UR119105696,2011-9-October,I stayed at this hotel and paid almost 200 for a room as London seemed to be booked up (X factor was in town) The room was small grimy and no frills even though it once looked like there should have been a hairdryer and remote control as there was a place name for both items. I stay in hotels for business all the time and all over the world and I have some pretty horrific experiences but I would say this place makes it into my all time top 1 worse hotel. Congratulations Travelodge no speeches required and please no repeat performance.,Andrew M
UR120368252,2011-9-November,To place this review into context I do not usually stay in such hotels though last year had very pleasurable experiences at the Premiers Inns at both Heathrow and Gatwick. This stay was booked by a charity for whom I was doing some work. I will try and remain objective and recognise the cost/value element but there is absolutely nothing good that I can say about this dirty scruffy "hotel". Paint on corridors and doors and in the lifts was scratched and marked throughout and the box room I was given had not seen any paint for a number of years. The only thing good about it was that it was quiet - though I suspect rooms at the front would be different. This was the first ever stay in a hotel where no soap was provided. The bathroom floor was dirty and covered with hais the bedroom carpet had not been hoovered for a long time. I tried to use the free wifi in the bar but gave up afte an hour - no problem logging on but slower than the slowest snail. I decided to have an early breakfast in the hope it would go smoothly- forget it. When I arrived at 07.20 most of the tables had been used and had debris of one sort or another on them - a waitress did later attempt to clear some - why the management do not realise that if they had given her a small trolley it would be so much more efficient and could have carried cleaning materials of which she had none - thus she cleared (some of ) the tales but did ot clean them. The juice machine dispensed cold water the supervisor shrugged her shoulders when told the toaster was on a go slow - you had to put your toast through six times to get it cooked - obviously an energy saving attempt. The scrambled eggs were inedible the bacon beans and sausages were cold though the sausages were tasty and the coffee - I am not even sure it was coffee...... Enough said - don't go near the place and I certainly will never visit another Travelodge.,allan09
UR107465446,2011-9-May,soiled towels toilet seat fell off toilet uncleaned was left pebble dashed. no plug in sink no soap or tumblers in bathroom.as hot as a sauna with heating turned off. no opening window .could not get another room as hotel was full at 11pm finally provided a fan off reception desk.no remote control for t v .20 minutes wait for drinks at bar . food at dinner took 50 minutes for starters to appear then another 20 minutes for mains followed by an inedible sweet. breakfast was a farce no cups after 10mins wait paper cups came servittes were blue cleaning paper from a roll on bar gave up with cooked breakfast as by the time bacon arrived 10 minutes after asking they ran out of sausage and beans bread was frozen .take our advice and stay well clear,yorkie041
UR92318067,2011-9-January,This has to be the WORST hotel i have stayed in we booked this as it was close to the Eurostar as we had an early departure. We booked a double room on arrival we checked in was give a room took ages to get to lifts terrible!! entering room looked on then we realised it wasnt even a double it was twin pushed together with wheels on!!!! there was rusty nails sticking out the skirting board the tv didnt work no batteries in the remote the towels and sheets looked grubby. Bathroom was Just as bad!!! It was throughly disappointing terrible start to our holiday and a complete let down by the Travelodge Chain. It was very noisy through the night and i think alot of the rooms where being used for some sort of business without being too rude!! Will NEVER Return.,sassylady24
UR116431145,2011-8-August,As I walked into the reception area my first impression was that this hotel needs a total refurbishment which was confirmed when I saw the room it was very basic (which was expected) but didn't expect it to be so shabby. For the 3 nights we stayed. the rooms were never cleaned once the only positive thing I can say is that the bed was made daily!! We had no hot water for 2 days as the boiler had broken. and the staff were rude and unhelpful. The breakfast was also disappointing we had to wait for more food to be brought out and then some of it was cold rather than hot. Didn't enjoy my stay and would never return!,UnhappyHullengland
UR119048518,2011-7-October,I stayed at this hotel for 1 night on a business trip. I booked 5 days in advance and was unable to take advantage of any reduction in room rate so paid 130. On arrival the service was fine and check-in was quick and easy. The room was small but I expected that to be the case on booking. The room was in dire need of repair and redecoration the walls were scuffed lamp shades broken and dusty and the bathroom had seen better days. The bed was comfy and the linen was clean the pillows were terrible ended using all 3 to provide support when sleeping. The room was very quiet and I slept very well. There was no hair drier in the room I only discovered this when I had just got out of the shower and I couldn't be bothered to go to reception and 'request' one. I paid in advance for the breakfast as I didnt know if there would be anywhere local to eat the breakfast was nice but not work the 6 there are macdonalds and other food outlets in close walking distance. The hotel location was ok only a short walk from Kings Cross it is worth noting that the Pentonville Road exit closes after a certain time in the evening so you have to walk an extra 5 mins from the main station. I was a little concerned walking to the hotel after 9pm by myself but it was ok. Overall I found the hotel over priced and in need of refurbishment.,MrsHutchy06
UR107257705,2011-7-May,Food is expensive and the bar and restaurant never opens on time and you'll probably have to wait 30mins for the staff to finish setting up before you actually get served. When you do finally get your food it will be small burnt and not all ingredients will be there!! I would not recommend you stay in this dump hole rip off joint!! Oh and don't decide what you want to soon as they have probably run out before they have even served a single person as we found out!! Staff are also rude you must have to pay for a smile these days.,Bingchick88
UR111981679,2011-7-June,Went here with my boyfriend and parents for two nights in London. The hotel is in a very good location but I would not recommend staying here. The hotel is like a very poor 70's motel. In my room there was grime on the bathroom tiles and the toilet flush was hanging off. The cistern also filtered water through into the toilet basin all night. Breakfast was terrible barely any options glasses and cutlery were sticky and unclean. Staff weren't particularly helpful when complained about this. On the second day there was no cups or glasses even available. Not worth 7 per day more like 7p....The hotel is no smoking but reeked of smoke from cigarettes. The rooms were small but fusty only 3 pillows on a double bed no phones TV was tiny and older than myself [I'm 21]. My parent's bedding had holes in it. Terrible even for a travelodge. Do not stay here it's pretty much a hostel masquerading as a hotel.,kimmisixx
UR117763405,2011-6-September,Reception and dining area look fine but once you enter your room you are transported back in time to the 1960s which i assume is when this place was last decorated.View from window was a courtyard car park with a skip which was used at 530 am every day.Room was dirtywalls covered in stains.bathroom was approx 1 metre x 1 metre.Poor effort from Travelodge!,Tammix
UR119003635,2011-6-October,Stayed over in London for work. London was pretty full due to London fashion week so ended up here. Wouldn't choose it again. the stay cost about 120 and would still have been poor value at half that. Had a meal in the restaurant. Given a filthy glass (could actually scrape the scum from off the inside) and not a word of apology when I returned it for a new one. The bedroom had obviously had a double bed removed (could tell from the headboard space) and replaced with 2 singles - except they were narrower than standard singles - looking like boarding school cots. Didn't really feel confident that anything was properly clean. Next morning all the lifts were out of order and someone from reception was coming up the stairs as we walked down telling us they'd be fixed within 2 hours!,Carokokos68
UR107154888,2011-6-May,Booked this hotel as my sister was coming over to London to visit thought it would be nice and affordable as it wasnt 1st time when i've used Travelodge! Totally shocked when i entered the room! Horendous! Dirty walls carpets very dusty furniture! Just couldnt breath properly! Complained to the reception ppl changed 3 rooms as worst!! Not very helpful and one man was quite rude saying if im not happy then i should go to another hotel pounting the pc to make another booking! Appauling!! We left next day and we didnt get a refund for the other nights we payed for!! Will not recommend!! Wast,Luzzie
UR111823395,2011-6-June,We stayed twice in a week there and back from Disneyland.The first time we were moved 3 times-room 1 plugs and electrics not workingroom 2 not cleaned and room 3 (11pm)dirty bathroom. Second time(11.30pm) leaking toiletfilling all nighttiles coming off in bathroomno power to the A/Ccouldn't open windowsno spare pillows availablebulb missing in bedside lightdoor wouldn't lock and curtains hanging off the rails. Met a couple from Sweeden and assured them that not all British hotels are this bad and they've been really unlucky.,ShrewsburyChefette
UR92004722,2011-6-January,First time staying in a travelodge and had my doubts however was assured by my partner that they're better than their reputation. Receptionist friendly. Went to our room view of some train tracks. Immediately notice that the radiator is falling off of the wall and later when I attempt to close the curtains the curtain rail comes off the wall. Not impressed so far. We went down to the bar to have a drink however there was noone there even though it opened more than an hour earlier. We waited for more than 10 mins with nobody arriving to serve us before I went to reception to ask for someone to come up. Someone arrived promptly. Went to pop back to our room before going for dinner else where but my swipe card had stopped working had to trek it to reception to get another one. Breakfast in the morning was lacklustre to say the best toast cereal sweaty looking cheese and the odd croissant on offer. Noone there when we entered the cafe and never asked for our voucher (as we had paid for breakfast when booking) needn't have paid at all and not a smile to be had when he did arrive. My partner also suggests that this was comparably expensive for a travelodge at 75 for a (shoddy) double room. However London prices must be taken into account I suppose. Thoroughly disappointed and won't be staying here again or at any other Travelodge if I can help it. Go to Novotel the other side of Kings Cross Station - Lovely hotel great service excellent breakfast!,jessmh20
UR95698437,2011-6-February,We checked in this hotel over the Christmas period for a couple of days and got it at a saver rate averaging 40 per night. It's a 10 min walk from Kings Cross station. On arrival after ringing the bell a few times we were NOT greeted by Maria at reception who came towards us asking if we were checking it. We got our room cards and were hoping to have a good enough room after having read the dreadful reviews and pics here. Luckily the room looked better than the pictures we saw with no damage to the wallpapers/windows..etc. There was a little flat screen tv as well. The bathroom was quite smelly though.....as if it has not been used for a while. The bed was the worst I've seen in my life......we were sinking in that mattress and felt as if the springs in the mattress were getting into our body. We did not complain about our room/bathroom fearing we might get something worse (similar to the pics posted here). We were just hoping when we could get back home for some nice sleep. Room was not serviced as well for 2 days and had to ask for clean towels at reception (which was run by only one staff at times......). Also we had to reactivate our room cards every day and had to wait at reception. We did not try the food in its bar. Only one lift was working and it felt strange as well. We mainly used the stairs since we were on the first floor but those were dirty as well and smelled as bad as the bathroom in our room. We checked out after 4 nights and again met with our dear Maria who frowned at us and said: 'Checking out??!!!.' Not even a smile. I know its not a five star but at least reception staff should show some politeness to guests. We were happy to get away from there. I would surely not recommend this hotel to anyone but if you are in london on a budget and manage to get this room at one of those cheap rates....then go for it. Otherwise you should get some better value for your money elsewhere.,pravish08
UR103062057,2011-6-April,What a MASSIVE dissapointment Travelodge! I wasn't going to write a review for fear of coming across of one of those 'Booked a 1 star but expected a 5 star'....but I had to pas on my experience. I booked a one night stay prior to on a week's holiday and one night on my return. The first stay was so awful my little boy didn't want to stay there on the way home : ( BAD POINTS Large parties are booked into this hotel. Lots of teenagers congregate at the entrance which can be intimidating. The hotel is situated in a right dodgy part of London. Was woken up at 1:00am by a large group of kids drinking and partying in the corridor right outside my room. They did quieten down after being told. Way understaffed. Evening meal was ok but took about an hour to be served as only 1 waiting staff serving about 100 people. Breakfast is vile! Watery beans saugages that taste of cardboard there was no bacon left so can't comment on that (!) croisants are in a big bin and people use their hands to rumage around to get them oh and good luck getting a mug for tea or coffee if you get that far! No soap or washing products supplied in the rooms. Room styles vary enourmously. (On each stay the rooms were very different). There are currently building works at the rear of the hotel which started at 6am. The first floor corridor smelt of sick and public toilets. The smell was so bad it put us off eating (no exageration it was absolutely disgusting!) The lifts smell of cigarette smoke & urine and are filthy. No telephone in the room so you can't even call reception. So if you do happen to have kids partying on your landing you can't call reception. BAD IDEA TRAVELODGE!!!! GOOD POINTS Bedlinen and towels were clean Bed was comfy Kettle tea & coffee. You can order bar-food and take it to your room but the menu is limited and there is defo no room service! If you get this hotel for 10-20 and can put up with the above then book. If not avoid this place like the plague!,Kira_77_11
UR95567585,2011-5-February,Just back from a night in London to see a show and visit the Wiliam Morris Gallery. From the sublime William Morris and his contemporaries to the ridiculous - our overnight stay was at a Travelodge. Location nameless but near a station. The trouble with being an Interior Designer is that you see all the faults in a quick glance so how about this list. Bed squashy and only one thin feather pillow which made me itch within 2 minutes of lying down. Changed for a lumpy synthetic one found in the wardrobe. Filthy blackout-lined curtains with the usual section fallen off its hooks so it is pulling away from the track. Gathering too tight to allow the curtains to cover the window so gaps of light appeared around the window. Blackout linings cracking and coming apart. Secondary glazing over a filthy square-sided window bay with one window left open so noise and cold came in round the edges. A bathroom so small that swinging anything let alone a cat was impossible so we took it is shifts to use the room. Ventilation fan not working ( are they ever in hotels?) so the mirror steamed up and had to be dried with a towel. No shampoo or hairdryer. The smallest piece of soap possible in a sliver of paper. Towel radiator not working - apparently heated towel rails are no longer approved of in hotel bathrooms as guests may not understand the notice which warns them it is hot. What is the purpose of a heated towel radiator if NOT to be hot so as to make the towels warm and dry? Sealant around bath and basin black with mould. Sealeant around top of built-in WC unit falling out in black lumps. Plastic disposable mugs in the bathroom. Bedroom furniture must have been at least 20 years old and in desparate need of a face-lift as covered with scratches. Corridor walls and lifts bashed and marked. half the lights not working - we tried moving bulbs from one fitment to another but it seemed the light fittings were broken. I won't go into the chaos that was breakfast. Suffice it to say that this hotel lacked any charm at all and was barely suitable for one night's rest.,reddogwhite
UR95456805,2011-4-February,Room awfulno toilet roll tv didnt workwall lights didnt workmould around the window lifts not working full of graffiti it had an empty brandy bottle in all weekend on the floor .Cooked breakfast not eatable.We could loan an hairdryer just for 1 hour.If this is what travelodges are like we will never stay in one again.,timmins257
UR116272176,2011-4-August,Recently stayed here for 1 night with 2 of my friends as we were going out and this hotel was very close to the location. I payed 129 for a room of 3 and from the first view of this hotel it looked like an abandoned museum of some kind as we got inside it looked a little more modern the lift was full of rubbish and looked like something from the 70's the whole corridor smelt of must and was outdated. When we got inside are room on the second floor it was very disappointing the wardrobe door was hanging off the room was not suitable for 3 people we could hardly walk around the beds the so called 'air conditiong' vent didnt even work so why it was there i don't no it got so hot in our room sweat was dripping off us and we had to keep standing outside in the corridor to cool down the tv didn't even work so guess that was something else just there for decoration the bathroom was tiny anybody overweight would have had trouble moving around in there and the stains in the bath were very unsightly the price i payed i would have expected a little more they should charge no more than 29 a night for the rooms here it's more of a hostel disgusting place will never be returning needs shutting down and major adjustments.,Sarah128_11
UR102780710,2011-4-April,I stay a many Travelodges around the country so booked this believing it would be standard reasonably priced accomodation. The location was not that geat at 15 minutes from Kings Cross down a raher unpleasant London street. Reception was average. The room booked was a family room. To get to this room we took a lift then had to got down a badly lit poorly carpeted staircase to the basement.. There was an unpleasant smell of damp. The corridor was dirty and the room in need of total refurbishment. It was below street level but at the top of the window it was possible to see people walking by. The bathroom was gross being very old with mould around the bath. Totally revolting.,SarahnJ0hn
UR119985729,2011-31-October,Expected a high standard as i paid over 100 for one night in the hotel but was shocked at how unclean and dirty the place was. Had to wait half an hour to check in then got attitude from the receptionist. Room - Compleate filth nails hanging out of the carpet toilet had not been flushed from the previous people. Sheets were stained and walls had molde on them! didnt sleep in the sheets as was worried what they would be like inside. Would never gi back!,Shaun J
UR122321656,2011-31-December,We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights I am just greatful it wasnt any longer. We checked in with Maria who was about the only positive mention in my reveiw very helpful and accomadating it was down hill from there. The reception was a tiled floor which looked like crazy paving. We then went up to our room. This was clean but had a bright orange painted feature wall not a good look! The whole room needed redecorating there were rips in the "lining paper" and the paint work needed re doing. There was a plain white duvet cover on the bed and one pillow each only one spare in the wardrobe. The bed was 3 foot smaller than the headboard! The room was not inviting at all. Tea and coffee was provided and replace daily. The whole of the hotel that we saw including the corridors wasnt just tired it was exhausted! Brekkfast on the first day was farce which included running out of milk bowls cups bacon in fact never at one time could you get a complete cooked breakfast and there were ques of up to ten people waiting. There was only one toaster working too.We were surpised that at ten oclock people were still being allowed into breakfast and paying for the breakfast at that time only to find all breakfast items being removed by the dining room manager. People had there receipts for payment and yet had to argue with the resteraunt manager a lady called Anna (wouldnt give her surname) to receive the breakfast that they had paid for. We were frustrated on our own behalf and on behalf of others being treat with contempt by Anna. We decided to take the complaint further and were dealt with by Malick believed to be the manager. He was superb at listening to our concerns and agreeing that the situation was unacceptable. The following day we are pleased to report a one hundred percent improvement to all issues mentioned. It was good to see Anna clearing tables and ensuring the buffet cups plates bowls etc were being replenished. This saw ques reduced and the flow of quests in and out of the restaurant area without unecessary delay. Plus points Maria Malick cleanliness and daily supply of refreshments. Neg points A very tired hotel and Anna! We would like to add that we booked the room under a "travelodge room sale"  so we received value for money. Had we booked this room at the standard rate we wouls of been extremely disappointed at the standard of the room we stayed in (314),sausanni
UR117484445,2011-31-August,Was pleasantly surprised by room until the top only had boiling hot water. Went to request bottled water to brush our teeth but ended up with the shower being boiling and having to change room at 1am. The staff made us travel up and down to the 6th floor to get room keys as they didn't have the deceny to bring them to us. Next room was blatently a back up room. One wall was gray from damp or smoke damage and the shower wasn't clean. Dealt with it however next morning the shower only stayed freezing cold. Went to complain and had a very unapoligetic member of staff assumed we could just have cold shower and change that afternoon. She eventually saw sense and moved us to another room simply for the shower with the promise of a new room that night. However we then discovered the key for our 2nd room didn't work so another trip downstairs followed by another because the woman had written 536 on the card and assumed we would 'guess it was 530'. Received a refund for our night so i guess they have some sensible staff.,melissaw92
UR119907210,2011-30-October,Arrived after 9pm and check in was quick and easy advised I was staying in one of the Millennium rooms on the second floor. I had forgotten my hairdryer but was told I could get one from reception in the morning there were none there at that time. Ah the Millennium rooms ............ I stayed in room 2011. Lift to the second floor along a corridor through double doors and then DOWN two flights of stairs to a street level room. The room was absolutely tiny I couldn't even pull my small trolley case through the gap between the desk and the bed and I even had to walk sideways through this. Plus points: Bed not too bad not the saggy mess I was expecting Bathroom small but with clean tiles and fully functioning shower Tea and coffee making facilities Working power points Good aircon Minus points: Walls looked like someone had punched them then decided to start stripping the wallpaper Loose TV aerial socket Street level so had to keep curtains closed Never did manage to get the hairdryer .......... As my company hadn't paid for breakfast this cost me 7.35 and was very poor value bacon and sausage cold so had cereal toast and tea. Check out easy that is after I had pushed my way through hoards of rude foreign travellers. Don't think I will be staying here again!,angelicmystery
UR121245373,2011-30-November,This has to be the worst travelodge we've ever stayed in and thankfully had only booked for 1 night. For the first time ever we could not eat the breakfast which was absolutely awful. Staff were disinterested customer service appalling - eg staff showing back to us whilst booking in with not an ounce of a welcome and then having ordered and paid for an evening drink was asked by another member of staff if we had paid who wasn't even serving us. Rooms old bathroom showing many signs of rust and not particularly clean rough toilet paper corridors shabby even had carpet rising up which could have caused tripping if not seen soon enough. We've done travelodge over the years so it is fair to make the statement that we felt it was the worst ever and believe that as a company they need to up their game as now our children are older and we do not HAVE to stay with them they have certainly put us off staying with them again. We wouldnt want to take anybody there.,joys-of-spring
UR110457203,2011-30-May,Dreadful ... Broken light fittings / electrical hazards.. The rooms all smelled of smoke ( it's a non smoking hotel)!!! Handles broken off drawers & wardrobes .. Paint peeling dirty the list is endless.. Asked for extra pillows ... Run out!!! Dormitory style family room my 6 year old learned the word hovel!!! Hotel full of youngsters partying till all hours ... rang reception via my mobile to the travellodge phoneline as I didn't want to get my kids dressed at midnight to go downstairs and a 2.45am the partying continued!! If hell freezes over I still wouldn't consider this hotel!!!,Mommapjk13
UR114895970,2011-30-June,It started badly. We had booked in advance and arrived to find that we were not expected. But there are two Travelodges in London King's Cross. We trundled our suitcases to the other one only to be unexpected there also. After much flapping of paper and eventually consulting a receptionist who could speak English finally we were expected and were given a room key. The room was very basic but that we had expected. It continued worse. We went to the bar for a snack. I ordered a soup and a roll. My wife is diabetic and needed something a little more substantial. She placed her order for potato skins with cheese and asked if she could also have a bread roll. No that was impossible the till could accept no variations to the menu. After a lively discussion with the barman I gave my wife my roll. Our room was in a quiet part of the hotel. Nevertheless it was noisy all night both from within the hotel and from outside. The bed was uncomfortable and there was only one small pillow. I had hardly any sleep. I have slept better in a tent on a bus and in economy class. Breakfast was not yet available when we had to leave to catch our train at 7 AM. But I slept better on the train.,colin_bass
UR122294205,2011-30-December,Firstly I've stayed here on about 5 or 6 prior occasions without any problems but it is my recent stay which prompted me to review this hotel. I think it's fair to say that if you pay 29 a night you shouldn't expect much - in fairness it's not a bad place to stay (within walking distance of Kings Cross) if you get a low rate. Check in was quick since we arrived late... We were given one of the Millennium Rooms which sadly looked like they had been refurbished during the last millennium. Wallpaper ripped from the walls dirty marks ugly looking carpet light fittings not working etc. anyway this was kind of expected and at the price paid I wasn't too bothered. However the housekeeping have a special secret that I'd like to share with you it happened each night we stayed so be warned! I put the "Do Not Disturb" sign outside the door on a night time (previous experience at Travelodge has shown me its the best thing to do if you don't want to be woken at 8am) however when leaving the room on the morning we noticed the DND sign had been removed - nowhere to be seen... When arriving back in the evening the DND sign had magically reappeared and surprisingly the room had not been touched cleaned no beds made no towels changed etc... I thought maybe it was a coincidence until it happened again the next day - proving beyond a doubt that housekeeping aren't really interested in housekeeping. On the departure morning I checked and the DND sign had been left on the door! Housekeeping even had the cheek to knock on the door hours before check out time.... In all the hotels I've stayed in I've never known housekeeping play this trick it says a lot about how clean the rooms are given the fact that the staff just aren't bothered. Give the place a miss unless you find a really cheap rate!!,pwelch
UR95358995,2011-3-February,Stayed for three nights. We were greeted by a rather run down looking reception with some very strange people hanging around which made me feel a bit uneasy. Had a terrible check in experience - staff very unfriendly and argumentative. A double room had been booked but on their system it said a twin. In the end we just accepted our lot. We paid for a locker to store bags so that we could go out and explore freely. We did not notice that once items were in the locker you couldn't return as many times as you wanted and would have to buy another locker token. Be warned!! The hotel has clearly had issues int eh past with non guests accessing the hotel - to get anywhere beyond reception you need your card. You might expect to then see nicer public areas beyond the locked doors but it is still grotty and unwelcoming. Only one lift worked which is not very good in a large and busy hotel. When we were finally able to access the room we found it to be a decent size and clean so nothing much to complain about there really. Overall the location was great for the meeting I had in the area for work and good enough for the extra days I had booked to explore London. The hotel itself wasn't too bad once you got beyond the public areas and the staff let the place down. If this hotel was cheapest in my search then I would stay here again and I know exactly what to expect but it wouldn't be my first choice.,EnglishRose79
UR117424563,2011-29-August,where do I start to describe this hotel! We had the misery of staying here for 3 nights it's a run down tired dirty place full of foreign students shady looking characters and general peasants. The rooms are dirty and worn out and I did not get one good nights sleep due to loud mouthed residents making horrendous noise in corridors between 1-3 am. The breakfast is rotten and you have to pay a premium for it. The staff are ignorant and generally don't really give a damn. Don't waste your money this place is a rotten hole it's the last travelodge I will stay in.,Gary M
UR110211967,2011-28-May,Do not stay here if you can avoid it. The first room we were given smelt of death and we could not open the windows it was hard to breathe. We complained and were begrudgingly moved to another room which still stank but not as bad. The sofa bed our daughter had to sleep on was covered in I hate to imagine what kind of stains. The paint was literallly peeling off the walls and the bathroom was disgustingly filthy. The rooms were never serviced for our three nights stay and we had to take out the rubbish ask for clean towels and service the rooms ourselves. We made mention of this everyday politely (one sholdnt have to). We were made to feel like rude people and a nuisance when asking for fresh towels and where to put the rubbish that should have been part of the stay/service. We are very tolerable people who dont expect alot from stays in budget hotels and never complain but this was ridiculous. Prostitutes frequented the hotel regularly not a good look for our teenage daughter.,karloandrachel
UR115897972,2011-28-July,We stayed here for 2 nights this week. Fine to stay in for a night or two but not if you're looking to relax in comfort! The room was clean but that's about the only positive thing I could say about it. The bed was so uncomfortable - it was too soft and sagged in the middle. We regretted paying extra for the continental breakfast it definitely wasn't worth it. We stayed here on the last 2 nights of our honeymoon and they seemed to place us on the floor for families with young children so it was also very noisy!,klompen25
UR117373588,2011-28-August,We stayed here for one night on our return from a trip to the south of France by Eurostar. We were actually quite relieved when we saw our room which was a disabled bedroom. We are not disabled but the accommodation seemed to be more spacious than the standard bedrooms. However after our arrival things went downhill pretty quickly. Firstly when we attempted to switch on the TV we discovered that the remote appeared to have lost both its back and one of the two batteries. This necessitated a trip down to the reception before we were able to watch the television. This however was minor compared with what was to come. We discovered that someone had decided to hang a (used?) condom on one of the wall lights next to the bed.Despite the fact that the room had been cleaned (to some extent) and the bedclothes changed no one seemed to have noticed the unusual item hanging from the light! When I complained about this to the 'supervisor' showing him a photo of the aforementioned object he immediately refunded the cost of the room (which amounted to more than 90) but insisted repeatedly that I delete the photo. We decided to eat breakfast at the hotel the following morning but the food was extremely poor quality and poorly cooked. This 'hotel' is absolutely appalling and should be avoided like the plague!,PatsyBirmingham
UR121075430,2011-27-November,Awful hotel check in staff put us in wrong room when we finally got to correct room it was dirty shabby and tiny. Did not use shower as bathroom was unclean and mouldy. Mattress was sunken in the middle and needs to be replaced. Breakfast was a shambles with cold food and no plates or cups! Its a budget hotel so you defiantly get what you pay for however the room was 100 per night. Luckily we were here for 1 night only but if it had been a longer break we would have definatly moved hotels. I will never stay with another travelodge it was disgusting!,els6876
UR119768863,2011-26-October,We stayed here on 22nd Oct family of 4. Location was perfect and we found it easy to find. Room really needs painting and wasn't clean. Bed was horrible and hubby ended up sleeping on the sofa and daughter with me as it was too bad for his back and really uncomfortable with 2 adults in it. Staff need customer service skills not 1 had a smile on there face and looked like they hated there job. Breakfast was cold and not organised at all. Will not be going back again.,diddldonna
UR115795581,2011-26-July,My boyfriend and I stayed at this Travelodge for 2 nights a Saturday and Sunday after trying to find somewhere that wasn't full (and cheapish) to no avail. We were told our room number and went in to find a spacious disabled room (that we didn't ask for as neither my boyfriend or I are disabled but we weren't going to moan about having a big room!) and realised that the help alarm was ringing. I went to the reception to be told that "You must've pulled the cord" however the man came in and turned it off. What is worrying is that the alarm must have been going off for a while and no one bothered about it. Although bed was very comfortable but we could hear the boilers under the floor and the air-con was noisy. As it was a street level room the windows didn't open and there was no ventilation in the bathroom. The hot tap water wasn't even luke warm and the shower took ages to heat up and wasn't very powerful (probably because the hose was leaking). As I didn't take my own hairdryer I borrowed one of the hotels; this worked for about a minute then over heated and started smoking. Luckily my friend and sister were staying in the same hotel and they'd bought a hairdryer I went up to their teeny tiny twin room to borrow theirs they said their shower was really powerful but the decor was tired and it was a bit dirty. I know that Travelodges are budget hotels but I've stayed in much better ones that this and to be honest it wasn't really all that cheap. I definitely wouldn't stay here again despite the location being close to Kings Cross station and on a quiet road.,AgentAlice
UR94523284,2011-26-January,The most basic of accomodation. Very tired. Graffitti in the internal lifts. Stained carpets walls and bedding. Rooms equipped with TV and kettle only (no phone no toiletries no hairdryer and just the one thin towel).,SRRNorthamptonshire
UR121026589,2011-25-November,Ranks with the Manchester Central as worst of the Travelodge chain ive stayed in. Initial checking in delayed as they couldnt find my booking on the system despite my having a printed copy of booking with me. Receptionist Katie was very helpful but it still took 20 minutes to rectify. Hotel public areas very busy including 2 police officers who were in the process of questioning a guest near the lifts. Lifts filthy scruffy and antiquated. Corridor to room musty smelling carpets grubby poor lighting. My room 425 classed as a Single but incorporated 3 child size single beds at a width of just 2 feet each. Strange smell in room. Lightingagainpoor. Bathroom small poor water pressure for shower. Grubby and dirty marks all over walls. Carpet slightly sticky. Decided to eat with work colleague at in-house restaurant. Reasonably priced food but poor quality.Overdone and almost burnt. Sleep pretty much impossible constant slamming doors throughout night music coming from somewhere at a deep bass lots of arguing between people in corridor for long periods of time more slamming doors etc etc etc. Work colleague experienced same problems 6 doors further down though at least my room didnt have what looked like dried excrement on carpet or blood spattered bathroom wall like hers did. Breakfast really not good tinned fruit fat soaked bacon and sausage diluted fruit juice sour tasting coffee. A pool of rank smelling water appeared on the floor apparently from the juice dispenser right next to out table halfway through breakfast. A yellow plastic hazard sign was placed over it but no attempt made to mop or clear it up. Absolutely nothing to recommend about this hotel at all.,Tommo44
UR109845825,2011-25-May,Don't be lulled into a false sense of security by the Travelodge banner this place is a dump. room tatty walls damp mould in bathroom appalling breakfast. the whole place feels like a cheap hostel with vending machines everywhere. room was barely cleaned and my bed was made under the book I'd left on it and towels left in a heap on bathroom counter. dark rooms too just very grim all in all,pinkjo
UR118522482,2011-24-September,The hotel is in a great location so i suppose that's what you pay for? However its very tired looking. the room was ok and clean just very run down! we paid 85 for the one night which isn't too bad considering the location. I wouldn't pay any more than this price though!!,71AndyR
UR119686864,2011-24-October,Travelodge used to be a brand you could trust for decent but no frills accommodation. Now it is cheap and tired. The mattress was so soggy we rolled into the middle. The window was a slit high in the wall and we could not see out of it unless we stood on tiptoe on the desk. Only 3 pillows were provided for 2 people and one small bar of soap. I have since suffered with a terrible neck and back ache due to the quality of the bed. It is near Kings Cross and so is in a reasonable location although there are plenty of closer hotels. This cost 98 for the night and was not worth it.,Spiritus26
UR105249272,2011-24-April,Stayed here for two nights. Even by budget hotel chain standards this was poor. Hotel was filthy. Customer service was minimal. Fixtures and fittings were tired and shabby. Walls are very thin. This is a large hotel and part of a multi-national chain should be able to do better.,sm71
UR119617772,2011-23-October,Positives  location inexpensive if booked on the internet in advance & coffee tea making facilities. Negatives ; tiny rooms even smaller bathrooms. No room for bags for 2 people and dreadful soft  saggy beds where it is impossible to get any rest. This seems to be indicative of most Travelodge hotels in UK but at this hotel - they "took the cake". Room also had a weird mysterious noise in the early hours ( plumbing ??? ) but it really sounded more like a ghost. Better value elsewhere.,beenaroundthailand
UR109533096,2011-23-May,Okay London is expensive. We've done the cheap hotels (think orange) and earlier this trip a mid-price. This booking was done on our behalf by a relative so we hadn't researched it ahead of time. That said I was expecting a bit more. After all it is a Travelodge. But the name doesn't mean much at Kings Cross Royal Scot. The lobby was the most modern aspect of the hotel--once you pass the check-in desk you're back in time to a shoddy past. The elevator ride is exciting because you don't know for sure that you are going to arrive on a floor. But the long narrow hallway walk to our room along the red-patterned carpet did not prepare us for our room--a stale moldy-smelling bathroom a stale smelling bedroom and a window dating from the 1970s greeted us. Okay the good news is no bed bugs. The toilet and shower worked--you just needed to look (and smell) beyond the black mold everywhere. There was a tv. The window could open 2 inches. The beds had fresh sheets. On the other hand the AC/Heat unit didn't work and looked as though it hadn't worked for years (can you say 'dust build-up'?). There was no phone in the room. Pillows were more like slivers of fabric than fluffy head supports. Beds were bouncy meaning the springs had sprung long ago. We didn't use the drawers. So cheap yes but Easy Hotel is similarly cheap--however Travelodge rooms are bigger and have a window. It was a great location for our early morning Eurostar departure--a 10 minute walk to St. Pancras station. You get what you pay for--we paid a little (for London) and at this Travelodge this was what we got.,mel1000
UR114675431,2011-23-June,Stayed for 2 nights in June 2011 and having read the reviews beforehand I was fearing the worst. Day 1 - one lift working out of three (seems to be a recurring theme here) and had to wait 20 minutes to get to the room. Day 2 - no lifts working! - had to heft my case up and down 2 flights of stairs. Restaurant had sectioned off 2/3 of tables for a large party booking leaving 6 tables for the whole of the rest of the guests. Food did not appear - had to have a refund - elderly couple in front of me were desperate as being diabetic they had administered their insulin and were becoming hypoglycaemic waiting for their food. Constant noise of doors slamming and people shouting during my second night here,james_bethel
UR97726543,2011-23-February,I stayed at this hotel for 1 night and have to say this was the worst hotel experience I have ever had. Travelodge hotels are generally cheap but good value normally. I arrived at the hotel thinking it was quite cheap for London but Travelodge's are a famous chain and must have a minimum standard??? How wrong. We arrived at the hotel and immediately it was incredibly dirty and the staff were really rude and poor. Initially they couldnt find us or any knowledge of a booking and then miracously they did find us. The rooms were very shabby skirting boards and walls all stained and dirty mould in the bathrooms paint falling off the walls No decour in the room and the window didnt shut properly. Therefore it was really noisy all night and hardly slept. Breakfast was SHOCKING! Very poor selection none of the staff knew what they were doing. Ran out of breakfast items and when asked a member of staff to re-fill was told they couldnt as they were not allowed to move from the spot because their manager would shout!!! Chairs were fithly dity rubbish and litter on the floors tables weren't cleaned. After leaving this hotel you genuinely feel you need to be fumagated!! None of the chairs in the lobby rea matched the lifts were shabby and did not feel safe in them at all. Horrendous experience... never again and would not recommend this to anyone. Not Travelodge standard at all and avoid at all costs.,avfc4life16
UR122018484,2011-23-December,Stayed for a night out with friends so wasn't in the hotel period for any length of time but that was by choice!! + Price - For London its great we paid ~60 for a room for the night Location - 5-10mins walk from Kings Cross although on the way you do pass another Travelodge which looks a lot nicer! Reception area - Is large and bar/"restaurant" well lit and looks ok. - Condition - On walking up to the hotel many areas of it are boarded up which is hardly welcoming! Surrounding area - A little rough to say the least with plenty of kebab shops and unsavoury types get a cab right to the entry would be my advice. Rooms - I stayed in the covent garden travelodge and the rooms were 2to3 times the size I felt a little cramped! Service - Have to ask someone at reception for someone at the bar to get you a drink seems to be a lot of staff not doing anything. Size - Seemed like a massive walk from the lifts to my room plus the lifts are hardly modern and swift!! Overall give this one a miss unless you get a real bargain and have your eyes open to what you are booking 1* which is barely better than a hostel.,Joey95
UR117146772,2011-23-August,We arrived at 9pm on a Saturday night after a long journey. On arrival in the room we discovered that there was an electric radiator an air conditioning unit and televison all with wires sprawling out the walls and on to the floor waiting for people to trip over them. Further inspection of the furniture revelaed splashes of paint all over following some slap dash attempt at decorating. The bathroom was truly revolting with poorly fitting cracked tiles a broken loo roll holder and other items of questionable origin. The shower did not work having no pressure and being started by pulling a rather rusty nail. When we raised these concerns with a rather surly young man on our return from dinner we were told that we should have checked the shower when we first got into the room and there was not much he could do about it now. It took a full and frank exchange of views before he agreed to move us to another room without a word of apology for the state of the room or inconvenience caused. The room we moved into was slightly but only slightly cleaner although there was a large amount of mould in the bathroom and paint and paper falling off the walls. We were also advised by another guest not to take a particular lift as the doors didn't close all the way. We were not able to get the cheap rates that some of the other contirbutors to this site seem to have done and it represented no value for money or quality of service at all. It seems it is using it's proximity to major train stations and the knowledge that many people will only stay for a short time as an excuse to shaft the travelling public. Only has a one rating as we can't give it a zero!,psmith987
UR120921189,2011-22-November,This used to be a good Travelodge but is now average and if it doesn't improve will get as worse as Farringdon. Stayed at Room 289 the same room I stayed at a few months previously. No coat hangers in the wardrobe I asked at reception but none were delivered during my 2 night stay. Toilet seat was broken shower was faulty grouting in bathroom needed cleaning sink only ran hot water no cold wallpaper bubbling on wall. If I had company I'd have to complain to be moved but was on my own so put up with it. Travelodge are definitely going down market rapidly. On plus side this Travelodge is very conveniently situated for most parts of Central London owing to its excellent transport links. Food and drink in the bar isn't bad either and reasonably priced. The Star chip shop across the road is excellent for pie and chips and donner kebabs!!,NICHOLAS042
UR109272957,2011-22-May,THREE of our room lights were not working and asked them to fix on the first night right after our checking in however we were told impolitely by the female receptionist to wait until the next morning because their maintenance people had already gone home and they could not do anything about it which was a joke for us as they cannot even find and change a light bulb!!! I have learned straight away that they do not bother to listen to their customers sincerely and take action on their complains ASAP. I asked again next morning with a reminder note and our room number on it but the lights had never been fixed during our stay (three nights) very disappointed. Toilet was dirty with a filthy stain on the wall which I cleaned by my self on the first night and I bought anti-bacterial wipes for the next two nights which was taken away from our bathroom on the second night. The location is good and the price was cheap but the next time I personally am happy to pay more for the better service than this.,JapaneseTraveller888
UR117080538,2011-22-August,Do not bother with this insurance that is offered with your booking at a cost of 1.50. This is a scam. You can only make a claim in the event of Death Serious Illness Injury Redundancy Call for jury service etc I made a booking for a room and then realised I had booked the wrong date. I cancelled the booking and re booked on the correct date. Travel Lodge debited by card and will not refund as it was a 'Saver' booking. The insurance will not pay.,NicsHols
UR105037162,2011-22-April,Haved stayed at many different Travelodges and have usually been happy with them but this particular hotel fell way below the standard expected. The room was filthy upon arrival l I found a towel which appear to covered in dry sick and tissues in the bath and the bedding had stains on it. The room facilities were poor the air conditioning did not work and there was no kettle in the room. The reception was bombarded with groups and it felt more like a low quality backpackers hostel than a hotel. There were insufficient lifts for the number of guests meaning you were frequently waiting and then when a lift arrived you could not get in because it was full. The stairs were not clearly sign posted and so at one point I thought i would never make it down to breakfast which on reflection would have been a blessing. I made the mistake of pre-booking breakfast - there was only once machine for toast and a big queue had formed next to it and there were not sufficient cups of glasses to get tea or juice. Had a bowl of cereal and made a swift exit. It really lets the Travel Lodge brand down would never stay there again.,Seadog243
UR97472006,2011-21-February,I stayed here for 2 nights either side of a trip to Paris. We picked this Travelodge thinking it would be close to Eurostar - our first mistake. The '3 mins' to St.Pancras is more like 15 especially when wheeling luggage. Inside the hotel the interior is cheap - carpet held down with duct tape chipped and tatty paint smell of 'old socks' in the corridors. Inside the room it was more of the same dirty carpet chipped walls scuffed black marks on skirting board. Marshmallowy mattress the bathroom toilet had brown limescale on it as did the sink plughole. We found the previous occupants shopping labels next to the TV which made you wonder just how thoroughly the room had been cleaned. It was noisy full of school parties and generally highly unpleasant. And the worst thing was it wasn't even cheap.,felixandmaddie
UR117045610,2011-21-August,The hotel room is terriblei have stayed in more basic hotels which were better than this.the rooms felt like a hostelthe staff made it feel like you were a burden to them and the restaurant food was poor.its amazing the difference between different travelodges.i booked this hotel thinking that they were all the same standard.how wrong i was.i have paid 29per night for a hotel room which were far better.i wont be staying at here ever again.,Tinaandant
UR100879853,2011-20-March,Just returned from a 3 night stay with my wife and 9 year old son. On arrival I was told that I had two rooms booked when I only needed/booked one and to make things worse it could only be sorted out by emailing customer services (still waiting for a reply !!!). The main problem for me was the hordes of ill-mannered ignorant inconsiderate Italian students staying in the hotel. They seemed to be everywhere in the lifts waiting for lifts loitering in reception and making noise till very late at night. One morning my family and I were having breakfast when two of the students decided to stand at our table and proceed to eat their food without so much as a 'excuse me'.......... god that pissed me off !!! I had a room booked at a Premier Inn but cancelled it to save a few quid do yourself a favour and spend a bit more on a decent hotel........don't make the same mistake I did.,tazman1963
UR114553826,2011-20-June,I stayed at this Hotel last week. On arrival I was greeted with a " it'll cost you ten pounds as it's not 3 pm yet" that was before I gave my name. On challenging this with the duty manager she told me it clearly states on booking confirmations at the time of booking. The organisation is work for uses an agent so this would never come through to me. And for the record other than an attempt to extort money from the customer what is the fee for. I then paid the 10 pounds and was checked into a sub ground level room with a window located about 8 feet from the ground covered with a half open filthy net curtain. It was room 102 and I'll bet it's still half open and still filthy. The bed linen smelled old and not professionally laundered the duvet was wafer thin as were the pillows. The walls were stained and scuffed. The bathroom was dirty too the shower cleaned to hand height the toilet seat was covered in PVC water resistant plastic that was broken down and let water into the mdf frame. Once in the bathroom close the door and there was an accumulation of dirt dust and something else behind the door. I will never stay there again or indeed in a travelodge - I can only think there is not enough competition in London so dumps like this will thrive. Britain is about to host the 2012 Olympics and god knows what foreign guests will think of our country........when I complained to reception the girl I spoke to was arrogant surly and disinterested.,David145
UR116980025,2011-20-August,Scruffy small hot room for one night. Disinterested hotel staff. Okay for one night at 42 pounds for a triple room inc breakfast however if I had not got this super price I would not have been pleased. In walking distance of Kings Cross Station.,Silapin
UR118860474,2011-2-October,I stayed here with my boyfriend for a weekend at the end of September as I took him to London as a surprise for his birthday. We were hugely disappointed with the whole establishment. The welcome we got upon arrival was luke warm with staff acting as if we were more of a nuisance than the reason they were there. Over the whole weekend we stayed in Kings Cross all three lifts were out of action bar one occasion no apology was given for the inconvenience and from past reviews this seems to be a regular occurance. On the first night my partner and I popped into the bar for a quick drink before going to our room. There were only a handful of people drinking. The bartender was no where to be seen. We were waiting over ten minutes before someone arrived to serve us and even then we were given a frosty reception. The bar tariff on the wall was outdated and we ended up paying double the prices that we were originally quoted. On the Saturday morning we left the do not disturb sign on the door as we didnt want the room made up. When we got back that evening the sign was no where to be seen our room had been made up and all our toiletries had been left just chucked in the sink. When on the sunday morning housekeeping knocked on the door as we had no do not disturb sign to put out we shouted no thankyou which completely ignored and three women came barging into the room with no further warning. All in all a most unpleasant stay. We shall not be staying with travelodge again and we will only be recommending to others to STAY AWAY!!!,slemilliere
UR100756633,2011-19-March,This was truly a hotel from hell! Mould all over the Walls drafts through the windows damp sheets which my 10 year old couldn't sleep in so had to sleep fully dressed gangs of teenagers roaming the corridors trying to get into our rooms police called in at 1:30 am to keep watch on floor 5 which had little effect drawers hanging off units pitch black corridors vomit in the sink when you arrive in your room...........I could go on! Environmental health need contacting and this "hotel" needs shutting down!!! I have never experienced anything like it!! Do not under any circumstances stay here.,Roommover
UR120763692,2011-18-November,this hotel should be shut down i have never seen so poo in my life 6 room changes and each room was dirty smelly and mouldy !!!!!!!! ended up having to bring my small children out of the hotel because of the safety issues !!!! walking them through london to get to kings cross station late at night and travelling 2 hours home !!!,Michelle F
UR100670115,2011-18-March,The rooms are damp dirty and stink. Gangs of teenagers roam the corridors banging on doors and scaring my daughter and I to death. We are there now. The hotel say they cannot move us. There is vomit in the sink and water running down the Walls next to the bed. My friend is on second floor which is better. Fifth floor is hell.,Dotsmell
UR115475261,2011-18-July,We stayed there for 5 nights and it didn't get any better we just got used to it. It was no more than a backpackers hostel. Rooms were tired shabby and grubby. Stains on carpet light fittings falling off wall paper ripped (you get the gist). I have now read reviews and someone mentions about not expecting aircon for such a meagre price - I have to disagree when you can't open the windows because of the noise outside then I think aircon should be a must. Breakfast was like a cattle market most mornings although there appears to be a separate room for 'groups' this did not stop the 'groups' coming down to the main dining area making it very busy. The cleanliness of the bowls/area left alot to be desired. One morning staff were wrapping cutlery in the 'paper towels' used to dry your hands in the toilet ! Unfortunately we had been booked in there for the whole week but really it was one of those places where you really only want to stay one night and only if you really have to. We had another booking in there for later in the year which as we type is currently being changed as we will not return.,KAA905
UR121866913,2011-18-December,We stay from 13-14 dec. the false alarm was alert during 3 AM. Everybody have to evacuate during the night. Also staff are terrible ESP the curly hair guy and black guy. they never explain for breakfast voucher which is written WiFI. They never have a service mind. I will never stay here again!,Anonymous879
UR108594396,2011-17-May,We couldn't get served at the bar at 11.50pm on a Saturday night. Also the bedroom walls were filthy and stained and the ground floor area stank. Do you yourselves a favour - avoid.,TedSalad56
UR93431737,2011-17-January,I booked this hotel for 2 nights and only ended up staying one!! I stayed in a triple room that you could not swing a cat in! The single beds were so close together that if you rolled over too quickly could end up on the next bed. I ma sure the beds were intended for children and not adults. The room had not been cleaned properly from the previous occupants and had light bulbs out. I found the room quite depressing. If you get this room for a very small amount of money and just want somewhere to sleep then maybe it is worth it as the location is good. If you are being charged a decent amount then definitely look elsewhere. We moved to the Holiday Inn Kings Cross for our second night and it was like a palace in comparison to here - for the same price. Shop around!! The only thing in their favour was that the management dealt with my complaints well - maybe they are used to them!!,Smog
UR96985666,2011-17-February,The roof was mouldy the televison cracked and a plaster was keeping he indow together. To class this as a hotel is unfair to hotels a persistent alarm was goign off early in the morning and went going for at least 30minutes.We were nott he only people to experience problems as a group of women also were making a complaint as we vacated the hotel,NickSFCB
UR121837761,2011-17-December,Stayed here for 3 nights in December 2011 with a friend and would not go back. Very unhelpful staff and unwelcoming reception area - desk is dirty and most floor tiles are cracked. When we first got to our room I was surprised how big it was compared to other London hotels it was also the most basic however. The bed was the most uncomfortable one I've ever slept in and there was a mini egg on the floor so it hadn;t even been hoovered before we arrived. The lid fell off the kettle and the radiator squealed when you turned it up. Of the 4 power sockets we had only 2 worked. On the first night of our stay the fire alarm went off at 4:30am and we all had to be evacuated. I understand this was not the hotel's fault but the way they dealt with it was terrible. We were standing outside in the cold for 15 minutes until a receptionist came out to tell us it was ok there was no fire and we could go back in. At this point the alarm was still ringing and the fire brigade had not arrived so how he knew there was no fire I do not know. Another 15 minutes passed with no communication until eventually the alarm stopped ringing and we went back to our rooms still nervous about the possibility of a fire as we were all trusting one receptionist who didn't seem sure about what to do. The location of the hotel was good with tube and major rail stations nearby but that's the only good point I can make I'm afraid.,polythenegirl
UR116846315,2011-17-August,We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights on a block family booking. On arrival the rooms were not ready so the hotel kindly allowed us to leave our bags in the one room that was. However after dragging all our luggage up to the third floor when we entered the room it had not been cleaned. There was food on the floor and on the unmade bed and wet towels on the bathroom floor. The second room they offered had been cleaned but the bathroom ceiling looked like it was about to fall in. The room we eventually got was ok if a bit worn with chipped woodwork and a shower base that filled up and threatened to flood the bathroom. On the first morning we went down and paid for breakfast. The area is too small for a hotel of this size and the quality of food was very poor. On our third day we arrived back at 11pm to find that our room had not been cleaned. I will say that some of the rooms allocated to our family were ok but that the quality of rooms differs greatly. All in all I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.,DenM_11
UR118188462,2011-16-September,Stayed mid week for business and booked a week before at 160 per night (not including breakfast) being a charity we have to try and keep our costs down and this was the cheapest. However how they have the cheek to charge this figure is beyond me as it really isn't worth more than 30 a night. The room was clean by dull smelt and the air con didn't work properly so I could be either cold with no aircon on or boiling with it on. There really was a smell of sick in the room and the draft coming in at the window wasn't nice. I just felt really grubby being in the room. Breakfast is to be avoided at all costs and there is a real hygiene issue in that the cooked breakfast is sitting out on hot plates which obviously aren't working as the food was cold when you sat down. To pay 8 for a cold breakfast is just not good. The kettle in my room also didn't work and clicked itself off after 20 seconds so the only way to get a drink was to hold the lever down which was slightly worrying. The iron i borrowed the next morning had exposed wires several times along the lead and I think that sums the whole place up in that its obvious no one really cares. However on a plus point I found the staff quite friendly and nice and if I had paid 30/40 I'd probably sayit was ok but for 168 it just felt like i'd been robbed.,holidaybuddy2010
UR113884322,2011-16-June,The room was clean but the landing and the windows were filthy. On arrival i was given the swipe to an already occupied room. That sort of error is just scary. Rapist murderers thieves...given the key to your room! Their online customer service is also dreadful starting with the awful form which forces you into stating two queries before it's accepted. When they replied back the answer was nothing to do with either the real query or the extra one i was forced to give. Their booking line often have you listening to a circular recorded meesage. Seems cheap rooms mean very bad service all around.,Sossity2
UR93255100,2011-16-January,Of course probably like most people who stay here it cost us very little. And I guess it's a case of getting what you pay for. The fact is that the building was probably put up in the sixties it's a huge barracks of a place it's in a not very congenial location so the staff have an uphill struggle to make the place presentable. Our bedroom was small no chair we couldn't get the TV remote to work the extraction fan in the bathroom was falling off the wall and there were screws sticking out of the side of the bath. And the beds are extra narrow. Nevertheless it seemed clean and we slept well. The cafe downstairs looked quite jolly. But we'll avoid it next time however cheap it is.,mike_in_orchard
UR121810996,2011-16-December,We stayed for two nights as a family. The location is great near to the tubes etc. The bathrooms in both rooms were disgusting mouldy shower curtains and mould around the bath that was thick and hadn't been cleaned in months by the look of it. Staff friendly on check in but soon changed when we had to repeatedly go back to get key card to workthen found no electric to sockets in one room. Breakfast was ok for rest of family but unlike other hotels including their own chain you were not allowed to buy just toast it had to be a full english or they directed me to a cafe down the road if I only wanted toast. 4am fire alarm couldn't be helped but the lack of staff and information would I believe be a problem if it had been a real fire nobody really knew what was going on especially if you came out of the hotel at the back as there was no info at all there but hey it was a false alarm so that may be different if they knew if was real. Yes I agree that it was a cheap hotel and not 5 starbut that is no excuse for the lack of cleanliness in the bathrooms and the ladies toilets in reception made me feel sick. Would not stay here again and would think twice about the whole chain if this is the standard they are.,ELWUk
UR116819781,2011-16-August,The room was like a sauna even with the windows open. You get what you pay for so don't expect the ritz. Did the trick as a base.,bumbleuk
UR119328381,2011-15-October,Booked a triple family room for a night before catching the eurostar. I'd read the reviews on here and was reluctant to stay here but as I only paid 35 for a triple en suite room I thought 'oh it can't be that bad!' - and was I wrong! I was travelling with my husband and son and we arrived around 830pm on arrival the hotel looks dirty and the stairs to the reception was blocked by groups of teenagers and people smoking. Check in was speedy and effcient - that was about the only plus point to the stay. When we got to the room the first thing we noticed was the smell of the room - it stank of stale urine. There was dubious wet patches on the carpet the room was pretty cramped and shabby looking. The bathroom was small and there was mould in the gaps between the tiles. The bathroom made me feel like I wanted to bleach it before using it. probably the most annoying thing about the room was that although the lights worked none of the power sockets worked - so I couldn't charge my mobile use a hair dryer watch tv etc.Reported this twice to reception but they seemed pretty disinterested. Throughout the night the hotel was SO noisy. There were groups of teenagers running up and down the corridoor shouting and screaming until around 4am at one point in the middle of the night someone actually opened our room door! - bit disturbing as the door is meant to be locked unless u have a key card!!! it really was a disgusting room a horrible hotel and a terrible nights sleep - I wouldn't stay again or advise anyone to stay there no matter how cheap a deal you get on it! Fortunately I only paid 35 for this but Travelodge seem to charge upwards of 100 for this hotel! On return from Eurostar I stayed at Premier Inn Kings Cross - 1000 times better.,jml08
UR108308374,2011-15-May,Firstly we booked a triple room with 3 single beds and ended up with a family room with a double and single bed... not very pleasant when you are three men travelling together. On check in receptionist didnt want to even speak to us just pointed to a machine for us to check ourselves in... the machine didnt even work and it was hard work to get her to listen to us and check us in manually because one of us had checked in slightly earlier they didnt want to give us any more keys to the room. On arrival in the room we had a smashed window there was a hole in the sink in the bathroom the room looked at best like a dormitory the beds were lumpy and extremely soft. No batteries in the remote control for the tv. We knew when we booked a travelodge it wasnt going to be the best hotel in the world but we werent expecting it to be quite so awful have stayed in travelodges in the past and none have ever been this bad,debs398Norfolk
UR113712656,2011-15-June,Awful awful place. Old downtrodden dirty noisy words cant describe. Do not bother even for one cheap night.,Hayroe
UR121758078,2011-15-December,This travelodge is awful found a sweet wrapper on my bedroom floor when I checked in so obviously not cleaned properly. The headboard had someone's initials carved into the headboard (classy). There were no bath towels provided. Worst of all is hearing the london traffic at 6am having road wars horns beeping sirens etc. one guest even had someone else check into his room whilst he was asleep!!! I wouldn't stay in this hotel if you offered me a night with Julia Roberts and I do like that girl...,matthew s
UR120565368,2011-14-November,This is the poorest Travelodge I have stayed in. Others have been pretty impressive against Travelodges' widely regarded "no frills" reputation but this one does it no favours. Before I list the many negatives the few positives; sleep quality - the bed was fairly comfortable no bed mites etc. There also wasn't much outside noise keeping me awake only the occasional vehicle siren outside my room was on the 2nd floor so maybe people on the 1st floor have it worse. Also unlike other Travelodges' I have visited when you book a twin room you actually get 2 single beds rather than 1 double and a sofa bed. Onto the negatives not sure where to start. The room was pretty small much less spacious than twin rooms in other Travelodges I have stayed in. The bathroom was ridiculously small literally marginally bigger than one you'd find in a caravan. The room itself was outdated and rundown and if all rooms in the place are like it they all need major refurbishment work. The wall paint and carpet looked old with the paint cracked and peeling in places. One of the wall lamp lampshades had a huge dent in it and the outdated TV (was actually surprised to find had freeview) kept randomly switched itself off and the power socket was half hanging off the wall.........dodgy!. Finding your room can be fun if you enjoy un-necessarily walking around 60 something rooms before you get to yours. If all floors are planned like the 2nd floor then their in a horse-shoe shape with the rooms being the steel shoe and the lifts being the gap. If your room is numbered highly i.e 260 370 rather than 201 315 to avoid walking around like a idiot for 10 minutes go through the door on the left when you come out of the lift as you'll start at the highest numbered room on that floor. If you go take your own clothes hangers...........seriously. The wardrobe in my room had no clothes hangers I went to the reception to ask for some there were none left. That is poor surely they can afford and be bothered to buy enough clothes hangers for every room in the place??. I think the 7 buffet breakfast in all Travelodge's are overpriced and overrated however in some you don't really have a choice as there aren't other dining options available. Not here. Outside and around this place are some cafes try them for breakfast. Overall for the price paid not pleased. There are alternatives in the area; there is a Premier Inn about 10 - 15 minutes away from this place try that even if its a little bit more expensive I would still recommend it.,ttmDyfed
UR121698849,2011-13-December,Well on arrival we had to pay 10 early booking in fee. The room was very shabby but the bed linen was clean. The shower was in need of a good refurbishment. mould all around the bath a nd the shower curtain was disgusting. Trying to have a shower without treading on the shower curtain. The breakfast.......well... went to cups of tea no cups no bowls for the cereals had to stand and wait nearly 10 minutes before the milk arrived for the cereal. My husband got a full english and went and sat down to eat it and it was stone cold. He prompty left his breakfast and asked to see the manager. The manager was quite polite and gave us a full refund. Cleaners wondering around the eating area with mops and buckets in hand. Do not stay here ........this is the worst travel lodge we have ever stayed in......,NSBruce
UR103860209,2011-13-April,Put simply the staff here are nice but it is the worst hotel I have ever had the misfortune of visiting in the UK. Dirty smelly awful rooms no iron no phone terrible food. It is drastically unsafe in and around the hotel for solo travellers. Homeless people come into the hotel to use the toilets. There are sex workers walking the streets and gangs of men shouting at women in the street. Avoid this place. Bad nights sleep.,Greggbb
UR120507840,2011-12-November,I have stayed at many travelodge over the years and generally found them to be modern-ishclean and quiet. This travelodge is none of those things. Considering the price they charge you should shop around. - hot water out of the cold tap - pulsed hot/cold shower - intermittant lift - very noisey - strange guests - food was bad,Dewi2001
UR107895866,2011-12-May,Stayed here for one night on Business in May 2011. Certainly this hotel is not up to the usual Travelodge standards - old dirty and slightly smelly. Room was of a reasonable size but in desperate need of new decor walls covered in weird marks dread to think what some of them may have been. I was on the quiet side of the hotel which was still very noisey. No aircon just a dodgy window which you couldnt open if you wanted to sleep because of the noise. Bathroom was actually quite clean but toilet seat was broken (i.e not attached) and the shower was more like a dribble but was at least hot. Breakfast - one word - terrible! Go to Mcdonalds instread. Location - close to Kings Cross station no problems.,davidwillcocks
UR112966227,2011-12-June,We booked - but they claimed not to have our booking. Thank goodness too. While we were trying to sort out our reservation we saw one guest shouted at by the manager (yes actually shouted at) another refused an extra pillow (he had one only - not enough for the double bed he was sharing) and we saw another told that he had to stay in the dirty smelly room he had been given. He wouldn't be given another room and he would be charged if he left. Thank goodness they screwed up our reservation.,andrewjetjockey
UR96324389,2011-12-February,I booked to stay at the Travelodge Royal Scot in Kings Cross on 9th September as my colleague and I were to catch a very early train the following morning. My first impressions weren't good. The level of mess in the lobby was disgusting. There was rubbish absolutely everywhere. There was graffiti in the lifts and there were hundreds of noisy teenagers running riot in the lobby and on most levels including on our corridor where we were supposed to be getting a good nights sleep. It was very daunting to be surrounded by such noise and mess. I could hear the noise clearly from our twin room. The beds were smaller than an average single bed although the linen was clean. No wake up call no hairdryer. The lights blew and we were left with one bedside lamp. The bathroom had mould along the tiles and the bottom of the bath was not dirty but grubby (just needed a spot of bleach) The walls were tatty and I've stayed in better hostels. I really did not feel comfortable at the Royal Scot and I soon realised that it may be quite difficult to get a good nights sleep (if any) I left the building and headed over to the other Travelodge in Kings Cross on Grays Inn road. A very courteous girl at he desk in the lobby told me that unfortunately they were fully booked and so we couldn't move hotels. Around 11pm we went straight to bed despite the noise which was still loud. I awoke at 05.30 as scheduled only to discover my colleague had not slept until 03.30. She felt awful and consequently was not able to work the following day. She went back home and I went to Paris by myself. Fulfilling not only my work but hers too. I was shattered at the end of the day she had to miss a days work and so in conclusion our stay at the Royal Scot was an enormous waste of money and time. I would not recommend staying at the Royal Scot I would actively deter anyone from staying there.,carolineaw
UR117936703,2011-11-September,We stayed over Bank Holiday weekend and got it super cheap for London. Initially I was disgusted by this hotel as it was disorganised shabby and generally just horrid but my partner reminded me of the price that we paid and the central location. So on reflection we pretty much got what we paid for. If you want a nice hotel you need to pay more! We didnt want to pay more so technically it ticked our boxes!! Breakfast was pretty good big queues but was a very tasty full english buffet. Although I didnt like the hotel I would stay again for the cheap prices and good location.,pollk1981
UR121615853,2011-11-December,dreadful from the minute we entered reception staff seemed inexperienced allowing interruptions from noisy guests; in need of serious refurb - mould/dampness round window poor repair jobs in toilet; only one of three lifts working; on dear!,itsmax
UR107726275,2011-10-May,The bed sheets were clean but that was about the only thing in the room! Cobwebs and dust everywhere wall paper and paint very tired lots of marks on it even a hand print above the bed!!! Bathroom was damp mould growing in places and toilet dirty. No sound proofing on the windows so heard traffic noise all night even though my room wasn't that close to the road! Safe to say I won't be back. Glad I was only staying one night!!,babychicken77
UR112512910,2011-10-June,Avoid if you can. I paid over 170 pds for a room which I was reluctant to sleep in. Awful narrow bed shabby and grotty. Noisy place.- maily due to no consideration from some other guests.,inasense
UR96106913,2011-10-February,Room was in a terrible condition: Wallpaper was ripped and falling off the wall The window would not shut properly and the window lock was broken The door did not close properly and rattled as people passed in the corridor outside The furniture drawers were broken The curtains did not close properly and were very shabby I contacted Travelodge about this and they "Thanked me for the feedback". This has definitely put me off using Travelodge in the future,FrankStilgoe
UR110950893,2011-1-June,we booked as it was a cheap price for a one night stay in london. upon approach from near to kings cross station we realised the area did not look well cared for and makes you feel a bit wary of where your hotel is situated. we eventually found the hotel and did not look to bad just like you expect from a travelodge reception nice staff polite and helpful. we had booked on the internet for a family roomTHE PICTURES DEFINITELY DO NOT LOOK ANYTHING LIKE THE ROOMS YOU GET. they might has well have put a picture of a room in buckingham palace because they are nothing like the one on the website. these pictures must be of what the rooms are going to look like as they say they are undergoing refurbishment. the room felt quite small as there were 3 single beds in it. the furniture was old the air con did not work there was a hair in the bed the maids i presume the bathroom was clean but falling to bits and i wont even tell you what was on the back of the menu-needless to stay we went straight downstairs to complain saying about the beds but really we just wanted out. the manager was very helpful and offered us a full refund ( which apparently they do not have to do after 12.00pm- which is just ridiculous as you cannot go into the rooms until 3pm. i was allowed to use their phone to call the booking line to move (moved to travelodge at euston)we had to completely pay again but was to be credited with our original booking within 3 days - refunded to card. i personally would not stay here - i am a normal person with kids i did not feel they area looked very nice and would not like to have gone back in the dark you are really far out yes there is bus and tube thinks but not easily accessible. the rooms are nearly clean just old and out dated. the euston worked out about 20 dearer but would definitley rather pay this for the cleanliness better rooms and a 5 min walk from the station i would stay there again.,mrsboop
UR95224273,2011-1-February,Dear oh dear. Upon arriving me & my friend were very glad to be in the building having wandered around lost & finding out how bad the area was. The lobby is very very nice looking with a restaurant on the side. The girl on reception spoke as LITTLE as possible. Only then talking to us to complain that we only had a twenty pound note and she'd have to get change sorry for putting you out there. Didn't think getting ten pound change would be a problem for a paying customer. We were paying for early check in..... We were given our key and vaguely pointing down the room she told us our room was on the second floor. We headed to the three lifts only one was working. Awesome. When the lift opened my jaw dropped. It wasn't big enough for my case let alone two adults and two cases on wheels. We squeezed in & stared at all the grafitti on the walls of the lift. Classy! Lift door opened (which was a relief cos its the kind of lift that you imagine DYING IN). We were glared at by cleaner staff which only added to the negative feeling I was getting from this DUMP of a hotel. People sure have excellent customer service and relation skills in this travelodge why I think I'll book some more nights....not. The room was another shock peeling woodwork tiny bathroom the bath was not big enough to drown a mouse. Two beds with paper thin duvets and one pillow? ONE PILLOW? And a tiny pathetic excuse for a heater in the corner. We FROZE all night & every moment we were in the room. The cleaners came and cleaned the room while we were out the following day and changed my friends bedding to STAINED bedding. Could NOT believe it. Couldn't even be bothered to complain because it was just a typical stinky dump that should be shut down. How they get away with health and safety I have no idea?! Didn't eat in the restaurant cos it was a complete joke of a price. If the food was anything like the service and state of the hotel no thanks. We went to a takeaway two minutes down the road food was amazing. I will NEVER stay in this hotel again I feel RIPPED OFF at the money that was spent to stay here. They should have paid ME to stay. Three lifts for a good amount of floors and only one working and looking back at the other reviews seems the lifts have been out of service for a long time so no excuse really. Not like they are using my money to pay for cleaning products as the place was a dump. Never ever again. Oh & because of the rubbish broken lifts a load of Australian people forced their way into the lift when there was FOUR of us in there already with room for only two was a nice way to end my stay with someone's face an inch away from my FACE. What an absolute joke of a hotel. (& we got followed twice. So I would NOT RECOMMEND to anyone that isn't in a group with less than twenty people in the group. Dodgy area). (and to think i came here to relax what a joke could of stayed at home in the shed and had more satisfaction).,k20below
UR102405510,2011-1-April,Room was next door to a ? plant room with loud noise of a compressor generator or air conditioning unit continuing all night. Not acceptable. To make it worse it was a room for people using wheelchairs - gave the impression of "sticking people with disabilities anywhere we can fit them in". Although I do not have a disability the impression given was not good on any basis.,PeterPan2
UR63664289,2010-9-May,Hotel is a 10 minute walk from Kings Cross (oddly there is another Travelodge closer to Kings Cross) and the big brown brick building looms round the corner as you approach it. On entering the reception was chaotic people everywhere and a few members of staff floating around. By the time I was served the receptionist was bored/tired/ready for a break and greeted me with all the warmth of a wet blanket. On getting my room key the trip to the room did nothing to change my initial impressions of the hotel the lifts are separated from main reception by a coded door this door is worn flaking and looks like a strong shove could knock it over. The lifts were a disgrace probably quite pleasant when new however had not seen a lick of polish for years. Out of the three lifts one was permanently broken one broke on the first night leaving one operational for a hotel of this size that was terrible. The room was clean and tidy but none of the cupboards closed properly the taps in the bathroom were hot or super hot (no cold!) the shower curtain looked like it held its own eco system and the windows were more reminiscent of a prison than a hotel. Night time was noisy through doors banking and guests shouting the next day things did not improve. Not a jewel in the Travelodge crown there are better hotels out there you'd be better of finding one of them.,Anton N
UR58105669,2010-9-March,Friendly staff at the check in desk but thats about it. When we got to our room we found it hadn't been cleaned my friend had a big curly hair in her bed and I had food in mine! opening the wardrobe we discovered someones suitcases and shopping bags it was only then we realised the hotelier had checked us into someone elses room. Clearly incompetent. Tea/Coffee facilities were available but no spoon to stir it with. Our room was warm enough but the other 4 girls said theirs were very cold and they didn't sleep. And now for the nitty gritty! The windows were filthy rooms poorly decorated there were 3 different colours on the walls which looked like they had just used up whatever they could find the hotel itself was just a maize and finding the reception via the stairs were very frustrating (The lift was always too full and took ages). There were sweet wrappers on the stairs which were still there when we left the next day large chunks of plaster missing off the walls on the stairs and mould on the window frames. My only advice would be if you are a student used to hostel bed downs for a night then this will be tolerable for you us bunch of girls are not snobby or posh but for 82 per room it could have been better particularly as the ibis just up the road in Euston is only 89-99 and marks at a 4* in comparison.,Stormyelf
UR70321391,2010-9-July,This is the hotel that air conditioning forgot. Stuffy rooms grimy bathrooms and as for a night's sleep? Forget it. I was booked in for conference nearby but at 60 quid a night do yourself a favour and go elsewhere.,Areyoubeingserved
UR66829323,2010-8-June,I have to say that I was extremely disappointed with the standards at this hotel during our recent stay. Two of the three lifts were out of order for the duration of our stay and the one lift that was in use was in very poor condition there were panels missing inside the lift some of the paint was scratched off and on one occasion there was saliva on the floor that made me feel really quite ill. On the occasions that the lift was too busy we used the stairs the walls on the stairs were disgusting they were dirty and in some places there was plaster falling off the walls. Once leaving the lift walking down the corridor to our room the walls were in a bad state they were also very dirty. Our room was just as bad in fact I would go so far as to describe it as filthy. The wall heater had black smears and finger marks all over it The walls were dirty and had marks and stains all over them there were also holes in the wall in places. The curtains were hanging off the rails There was a large crack in the frame of the television The mirror on the wall in the bedroom area was dirty and had something goodness only knows what dripping down it. The bathroom door on the inside had varnish missing and looked old and worn. The sink tap was very dirty and looked like it had not been cleaned for some time the same goes for the other fittings in the bathroom. The shower curtain rail was rusty. Around the tiled walls of the bath the grouting was covered in black mould/mildew not just small amounts but big black patches. The toilet was absolutely vile it was badly stained inside. There was a brown stain on the white duvet cover. There were only two pillows supplied. There was no "Do Not Disturb" sign in the room to use. So we were woken in the morning by the maid wanting to service the room. There was what looked like an old wall heater on the wall that had been disconnected; the vents on the heater were quite visibly full of thick dust. When the room was cleaned the towels were not re folded and were just left hanging on the back of a chair where we had left them that morning. On the whole the hotel felt disgustingly dirty and was in serious need of some cleaning and maintenance. I have never seen anything quite so bad in any other hotel that I have stayed in. The standards of cleanliness were atrocious. We booked using the Saver Rate despite that I still would have expected some kind of standards.,ustwo2008
UR89312979,2010-8-December,Pro - quiet room and a bath Con-few staff.no chair in room .no ironing board . 1 person on evening check in. Look for somewhere cheaper.,Filllua
UR74270710,2010-8-August,The hotel's location is perfect - near King's Cross station. This is its only redeeming quality. The hotel looks very run down both from inside and outside. It badly needs some paint to brighten it up. It is cheaper than other hotels in the surrounding area but you get exactly what you pay for. The air-con does not work in the rooms. The rooms are tiny. It has two lifts which take forever to go up and down. There are no phones or hairdryers in the rooms. You can 'borrow' a hairdryer for an hour at a time. There are computers to access the internet in the reception area. There are tea and coffee making facilities in the rooms. If you only want a base to sleep in in a good location and don't intend spending any time in the room this hotel is perfect. Otherwise I would avoid.,Donegalabu
UR86284411,2010-7-November,Well Travelodge Royal Scot is probably the worst hotel ive ever stayed in Room 507 a triple room was our given room. If privacy is what you want forget it because the skyline of London outside views the inside of your room due to none fitting curtains which are at 6inchs short in length and 6 inchs short in width. Also with damp on the walls broken drawers ripped lamp shades and the smallest bathroom known to man if you want to book here forget it and choose somewhere else.,Icky_10
UR66687132,2010-7-June,Comments: 1. There's no air in rooms (unless you bring some air from home). windows can't be opened (maybe because of safety) . the windows are actually blocked. There's aircondition in the room but it doesnt activated. It was told by management that "it is not activated because of MANAGEMENT POLICY REASONS". From 3 elevators in the hotel only one was actually active ( a rather small one). we stayed in that hotel 4 nights and it seems nobody even intends to fix these 2 broken elevators.so dont buy stories about "we r fixing now the elevators ASAP" it's B.S. each night several buses full with tourists are crowded into that narrow poor elevator and of course the phenomenon repeats itself also in the mornings. breakfast are fine but I advice you to give up the sunday breakfast unless you want to stand in line with other 250 poor guests waiting endlessly (we gave up). There's no clear signs to the stairs and when you go down you may find yourself in a closed yard under the building. in case of fire People will be killed over there! There's lack of towels and no phone in rooms. You need to be a genious to activate the taps in the bathroom. It took me about 3 days to find all the options of that heroic invention (cold/warm/strength of water). The stuff is divided. some it is apathetic but some are nice. Last word DO NOT...,Thats_10
UR78530201,2010-6-September,I am going to start this 'bad review' on a positive note. I had two weeks work experience in London and as my place of work was in Farringdon this was one of the closest travelodges. I booked two weeks at Kings Cross with a weekends gap in between. The first week I stayed I could not fault the place. I was allocated a room on the sixth floor. It was spacious and clean with an ample size bathroom and comfortable bed. Although overlooking the main road outside it was remarkably quiet. Overall a very pleasant stay. I returned the next week after a less than pleasant journey expecting the same high level of hospitality how wrong I was! On arrival I was told I had to pay an early check in fee of 10 because I arrived earlier than 3pm a little cheeky I thought but paid nevertheless. My room was on the second floor ( I say the second floor it was like wandering a maze but i eventually found the room. This time and as I opened the door I was greeted with a room that looked like it belonged in a completely different hotel. The room had a single bed (i booked a double) a desk with no chair (no suitable as I was using the desk in the hotel to do work in the evenings) I horrible smell of damp and general uncleanliness. Depsite being on my lunchbreak from my work experience i decided to tackle the problem earlier rather than later. I went back to reception where I queued for at least ten minutes before someone assisted me I handed the man the key and simply said i thought there had been a mistake as i booked a double and i'd been given a single. He snatched the key from me put something into his computer and insisted that 'all rooms where the same' I then told him about my previous stay and requested the same if not a similar room. He told me i must be making it up as all the rooms in this hotel are apparently the 'same'. I explained about the chair his solution was the following 'take a chair from reception up to your room if you need a chair so badly'. I then asked rather more sternly to change rooms to which I was told there were none clean unless I was willing to pay another 10 early check in charge! I refused and returned to the hotel after 3pm. My room was changed by a woman behind the desk. I was situated on the first floor. Granted in a double room (they got one thing right at last!) the room however had no window a tv that didnt work a tiny bathroom was noisy and generally smelt of an old peoples home. I am disgusted with the service i received over the second week of my stay. The staff were rude and unhelpful. This Travelodge is not worth nearly 90 a night. My recommendation is if you must stay here request a room on the 6th floor as these seem to be the VIP rooms (that apparently don't exist according to hotel staff!),GraduateDesigner
UR89157353,2010-6-December,Appalling - unsafe and unhygienic. There was a large crack in the sink mould all around the bath a broken bulb hanging from the bedside light. Got there too late to change hotels and the staff couldnt or wouldnt move me. The hot breakfast was cold and restaurant floor was sticky and the chairs filthy. Staff totally uninterested in helping or even recording my complaints. On top of all that they charged 200. Filled in the complaints form on the website and only got platitudes. You just know nothing was going to get done.,Godfrog
UR82222428,2010-5-October,I'll start by pointing out that I have stayed in many Travelodges. I like Travelodge because you know what you're getting: a clean basic room at a good price (and what you're not ie any frills). I am afraid that my stay in Travelodge Kings Cross Royal Scot has shaken my faith in the chain and I am definitely being more selective with where I stay now. First impressions of this hotel were not bad. All seemed fine on entering the large and modern-looking reception area and the receptionist greeted us with a smile (not always forthcoming in London). Things went downhill when we headed up to our room in the angriest sounding lift I've ever heard. I almost expected it to say "FOURTH FLOOR GET OUT". The fourth floor was even less welcoming with peeling paint and dirty carpets. So far so bad. Of course the worst thing about this hotel had to be our room. We had a family room with three tiny single beds crammed in. A light bulb out a cigarette end in the drawer graffiti on the desk and a broken panel under the sink which had just been left there rather than fixed (although it did seem a bit beyond fixing...). The inner window pane was jammed open letting in the freezing cold and plenty of noise from outside. We did inform reception about this and a workman dealt with it quickly. This and the friendly staff were the only redeeming features of this hotel. The location may be convenient but it's noisy our room was pretty horrible and we couldn't wait to get away. I actually felt somewhat unsafe staying in a hotel that is in such a state of disrepair. I can't think of any kind of traveller I'd recommend this hotel to especially considering that there doesn't seem to be any consistency in price (on some days it can be more expensive than other hotels in the area). Consider Travelodge Euston over this one.,WorldFuneral
UR69738103,2010-5-July,Avoid this hotel at all costs. If you want to stay in a London Travelodge use the Euston one which is new clean and in a much better (safer location). We had booked a triple room as there are no family rooms. The first room allocated was a single (at a stretch a double) with 3 beds squeezed in. We rejected this and were allocated a better room and the receptionist did this promptly and efficiently. The power has tripped in the room so another trip to reception to get maintenance who came and rectified it promptly. To echo other reviews the furniture is from the early eighties and falling apart paintwork tired and generally the hotel has not been maintained for years. We left our room about 6.30 and were back around 9. In that time someone had accessed our room left a coke can and messed around with a toy of my daughters. Luckily nothing missing. Reception manager didn't seem that concerned when I spoke to him about this and made no effort to apologise or want to get to the bottom of how our room was accessed illegally. Don't expect to sleep here noisy even if at the back of the hotel and seems to be frequented by large groups of teenage european school trips making noise in the corridors and slamming doors till midnight. The icing on the cake was getting reception to roder us a taxi to st pancras as we had lots of luggage. The "pre-booked" taxi cost almost double a black cab. If I had paid more than the 29 for this room i would be even more unhappy than I am.,ScottishFamilyGuy
UR54827898,2010-31-January,shabby tired no hot water no curtains and lights that worked when they felt like it! a disgrace to the travelodge logo. only there for two nights-came home more tired than i went. convenient for station but that is all you can say about it.,LincsBetsy
UR69269894,2010-30-June,Was booked into this hotel by a travel consolidator - Wimbledon week so prices were high (120 for a single room for the night). I'm not usually moved to post reviews but my experience was so bad that I thought I should share it. On arrival I had to queue for 25 minutes with heavy bags because the reception was grossly understaffed. Eventually I was checked in but it took a further ten minutes to get to my room because two of the three lifts were out of order. When I opened the room there was another family inside!! Clearly disconcerting from a privacy and safety perspective. So another trek down to reception and I eventually got a room from a disinterested unapologetic member of reception staff. Well more of an oven than a room - it was a hot day and the cooling unit in the room was out of order. Tried to borrow a fan but unsurprisingly they had none. The final straw was when I asked for an iron they could not provide this - asked me to return in 'a few hours' (after midnight) which I duly did - but still no iron and no suggestions as to how I could prepare my clothes for the morning. I was left lying awake in the sweltering heat listening to whatever my hard-of-hearing neighbour had on the television until about 3 in the morning. A complete dump. Stay in one of the budget hotels around King's Cross or Paddington instead.,notmad_nomad
UR81407443,2010-28-September,Travel lodge are really cheap for a good reason. This hotels decor is very tired. I appreciate you get what you pay for and if there is nowhere else I guess you have to take this. Just remember budget hotel so there is no shampoo no hairdryer no iron I stay in hotels because of work about 50+ times a year.... I rarely write reviews but feel the need to tell people what this place is like. Everything worked in my room TV toilet taps even though there were bits missing off the taps bathroom door vent was damaged room 405. Room and bathroom looked reasonably clean but just very tired. The single bed was not comfortable very narrow - child size the windows did open.... but even with the secondary glazing the noise of sirens passing every ten minutes you would want to keep windows closed... (not hotels fault sirens of course) but I closed my windows and could still hear sirens. Every door bangs - either the self closing mechanisms are broken or just not adjusted properly... I guess you could blame the other guests for allowing doors to bang. During my stay I must have been there with some of the most inconsiderate people araound... loud voices in corridors right through the night and children running up and down the corridor... again I suppose not hotels fault for guests behaviour. We had an evening meal in the hotel popadoms were supposed to come with the meal but we had to ask for them as they did not arrive. When popadoms arrived they were supposed to come with mango chutney - but they came with barbecue sauce - we pointe dthis out to be told they had no mango chutney. Did not think to explain that when meal was ordered or when popadoms were delivered. Just like they had no salad either but they did manage to mention that at the point of ordering.... At breakfast it's a buffett style food wasnt bad. There is no organisation about where people sit - so one person will take a table for four - seats are removed - and even though people have finished people still sit there talking even though people are stood waiting for tables... again I guess you could say not hotels fault.... but could they do something like a polite notice perhaps? There are really not many seats especially with the size of the hotel - I would recommend if you do stay forget breakfast at the hotel and grab something locally there are many pavement cafes within a few minutes walk.,LynneFL10
UR57328654,2010-28-February,If you get this room cheap - which in most cases isnt the case - I paid comparative price to the other London Travelodges which are mostly good then I suppose you might expect basic budget accommodation. However this doesnt account for the 'shabby chic' look of light fittings hanging off your wall - that cant be safe. Grubby carpets; grubby walls; beds that any prisoner would turn their nose up at and because the worn out secondary glazing couldnt be closed a night of 'sleep' that could be equalled to a night spent on a traffic island. I presume from the couple of positive reviews on this hotel that a small number of rooms have been upgraded - lucky you if you got one of these. In the majority they are disgusting. Travelodge say it is an acquisition property but its not a newly acquisitioned property so they should be dealing with this issue now. Close it down completely gut it and upgrade it to match the other London Travelodges and lets start again. If you can afford ' a few dollars more' stay away from here - you wont regret it!,Playitfair
UR81202837,2010-27-September,Stayed here for two nights recently Anyone who could find this hotel in any way acceptable must have a very low expectation of what a hotel should be like. From the moment we arrived it was obvious this was a very tired and poorly maintained hotel. The carpets were worn and with gum trodden in the lifts were tiny and even if they had all been working there wouldn't have been half enough. Our room although clean had a patch of wallpaper torn off funiture looked like it had been installed in the seventies and in the bathroom there was no plug for the sink and the shower curtain was so long it was almost impossible not to stand on it making showering decidedly hard. The single beds although quite comfortable were only two foot six wide you turn over very carefully. Breakfast would be best described as a bunfight. Too many people not enough seats although the food as actually quite good. If you're under thirty and need somewhere cheap and you're not fussy stay here!. I cetainly won't be back.,Bruceandann
UR88306493,2010-26-November,Access: 15 mins walk from Kings Cross tube Check In: Pretty quick Room: 4th Floor room. Checked my mattress and carpet for bed bugs but was happy to report that it was clean. Linens were clean with no spot. Bathroom: Ample towels for our triple room and tub/toilet/sink were all clean Sleep: Mattress was really weak and not supportive. Final verdict: Cheap rate central location. Our room was clean and better than other reviews. So go with an open mind. Otherwise try looking at Premier Inn as well.,SFOtravelguy
UR65395469,2010-26-May,Hotel is very run down inside and out - reception and bar ok but rooms tell a different tale. Bad need of a paint and new furnishings - although was clean enough. Staff would need serious customer care training!! On arrival were giving our key and that was it. I asked were are the rooms he just said that way - no help at all. Next morning was hectic at breakfast people queing for 45 minutes and staff VERY ignorant. Save yourself the money and eat elsewhere breakfast bit rubbish. It is close enough to the station and we got cheap deal so sort of weren't expecting much anyways.,kellymoy
UR59579081,2010-26-March,Stayed here for 5 nights on a self funded business trip hence need for Budget Accom. Indeed it was cheap but that's the only thing that can be said for it. It was more like a Youth Hostel overrun by foreign youths who were loud and noisy into the early hours either in the corridors or outside in courtyard. Rooms are also very tired Lift capacity also inadequate esp when foreign students ignore the stand in line principle. If you do stay here insist on being accommodated on a floorr that doesn't have youngsters on it and ideally try for courtyard rather than road ( very noisy also) outlook,smanamana_10
UR80840067,2010-24-September,My first stay at a Travelodge which I assumed was a cheap and cheerful chain of clean and comfortable modern hotels. Wrong! First impression of this hotel in one of the roughest areas of Kings Cross was that this drab depressing building looked like one of the worst East German hotels prior to the fall of the Berlin Wall. I did not get to see Pentonville prison in which is nearby to this Travelodge but it cannot look any worse! Rough reception area crammed with foreign students trying to check in with one harrassed receptionist also trying to deal with a client who wanted his money back because his room stunk and the basin etc was dirty. Arriving early prior to check in time I was charged 5 to rent a locker to store a small case and if you want to get at it later to retrieve something that will be another 5 please! Elevators and stairs were really filthy and corridors uncleaned. Fearing the worst I was pleasantly surprised by our 3rd floor room which was spacious and clean with a nice bathroom. However bed was very soft and uncomfortable with a mattress that had obviously seen a lot of action and sank in the middle. Breakfast was adequate but shambolic with initial problem for us because the receptionist at check in had not presented us with the required voucher for the inclusive breakfast requiring me joining another queue at reception. Breakfast room overcrowded and inadequate for number using it. I would have thought that Travelodge would have unloaded this ghastly place years ago - perhaps the Prison Services might be interested in purchasing it to help overcrowding at nearby Pentonville - as it can only damage their reputation,HytheTony
UR84655059,2010-24-October,I used to always stay in Travelodge when coming from Paris for a week-end or longer. The rooms are small and the bathroom was smelly. They gave us a room right next to the street so when there is traffic too much noise. Worst is I have noticed that kettle for hot water was missing. I told it to the cleaners and also at the reception. I kept asking for it twice everyday patiently. The day before I check out a guy at the reception rudely made me understand that my request was vain. I was there for notting hill with a friend. There are few details but they are things that you expect not to mention.,damiancham
UR59452651,2010-24-March,The bathroom smelt the curtains and wallpaper were both torn (and the latter was also spattered with what I hope was cola) and the sheets were slightly damp like they'd been made up days before. The shower curtain was grubby and overlong there were no nets in a room that was overlooked and the heating was defective. I am used to relying on a basic level of cleanliness in the cheap chains like Premier Inn and Ibis and this was simply not good enough. Maybe it suits the noisy foreign school trips that seemed to make up most of the guests but it made me ashamed of British hotels.,LuckyMermaid
UR54232495,2010-24-January,Travelodge should be ashamed to have this hotel on the books. OK so they warn you that this is a acquisition property and that the rooms may not match the picture they show on the website. But at least you expect it to be clean! Pay 10 more to stay at the Travelodge in Euston - its well worth the extra!,mikeinpreston
UR87930112,2010-22-November,First they could not find our reservation no one booked in as Mrs Drive not my name but I do live on a Drive...Eventually found it and we had to go to the 5th floor. Italian and French students running down the corridors. Room small dark and 2 very small twin beds. Food not too bad in the restaurant but very short of staff. Had to be up at 5-30 shower made a terrible noise. Bathroom smelt musty towels not too white and very well worn.,Taylormade20
UR68264590,2010-22-June,This has to be the worst hotel of the Travelodge chain I've stayed in. Manky carpets dirty lift (only one working) scruffy walls inside and outside the room and genrally totally rundown. The manager excused the 96 charge by inferring it is cheap and as it is about to get a makeover delayed by the economic situation - the best makeover would be to call in the demolition men I told him. I paid in advance for breakfast as I was catching the Eurostar. On a Sunday breakfast is not available until 08.00 - which was my train time! I did get a refund of the breakfast charge. You can excuse tired and faded surroundings in a hotel but not DIRT!,tfw2010
UR80405196,2010-21-September,Basically this hotel is in a rough location and is pretty grim. Having said that it's pretty cheap as far as London hotels go 76 per night for the triple room. All the pictures on here that have been taken by guests are exactly as our room was. We had a triple room for 3 lads for a boozy weekend in London for this purpose it was fine. However I wouldn't stay for longer than 1 night and not with your partner. It's a really old run down building thats had a Travelodge logo stuck on everything.,tyeardley
UR87753993,2010-21-November,Booked two nights in the Royal scott on arrival noticed it was grubby kids eating and seating on the floors lacks security to the rooms the lifts are dirty with grafity on the walls on arrival to the room we had to walk out as it smelt of whatever it was foul reported to reception and offered another room this was just as bad so we left the room and found another hotel and the distance to Kings Cross station was furher than indicated and you felt vulnerable I have used Travel lodge before which have been ok for what we paid but the Royal Scott is an insult to the name,trusty411
UR64868469,2010-20-May,An absolute dive i normally recommend Travelodge however this hotel is the pits. The building is falling apart the rooms are not what you are told you will get join the queue asking for pillows and towels and pray that you can't hear a noisy neighbor through the paper thin walls. If you're going to London go to the Southwark or Docklands travelodge they are great avoid this one at all costs!!!!!!!,HappyCorpse
UR56604646,2010-20-February,I have just come back from a half term break with my son. We usually stay at the travel lodge in Southwalk close to the river but this trip we got a good deal on the train so looked for hotels near St pancras. I noticed on the web site that it did say accusition hotel however Ididnt realise that it meant very poor quality. The minute I walked in i had that stomach dropping feeling. The computer system couldnt keep up with the bookings. Not enough Staff on reception. Staircase is cold and has big lumps of plaster missing on the walls. Carpets are worn. Room had curtains that were not hung properly. Stains on the shabby worn dark wood fittings. Old TV that rolled slightly. Mould in the bathroom. No house keping service on one of the days went down to ask for my dirty cups etc to be removed..no one came! Cue for breakfast. Poor quality food. Toaster that doesnt toast Expensive Bar..I could go on. The area was not nice but I knew that. Close to what we wanted to do that trip. what I didnt expect was shabby horrible accomodation. I only stayed and didnt make a fuss for the sake of my son who was really looking forward to the trip..so I went with the flow as he was looking a bit down hearted !! Im reading some of the reviews from the past few weeks and thinking I wish I had looked at this site before. It was cheap at about 35 pounds per night but i would pay more and go else where another time. On the plus side and contradicatory to some other reviews it was with great trepidation I had to move the beds and bottom sheets in a frantic search for a lost mobile phone... they were clean ! ..luck more than judgemnet !. Travel lodge sort this place out it has put me off !! yes the duvets were very thin oh and windows were filty yuk! Probably ok ish if you cam get a 9 room and you are very relaxed about where you stay staff especially at breakfast time looked close to breaking point.,EastMidlandsMillie12
UR90316153,2010-20-December,Here is a bullet point list of what was wrong with this hotel Poor customer service 15 per day to use the car park Smelly and un clean beding Grafiti filled lifts No maid turned up to clean our room Fast food packaging left in corridors Unhygienic plaster left in the lifts Broken Curtain rail Broken window Twin room when we booked a double Broken shower so could only have a bath Noisy Smelt horribley of smoke AVOID AVOID AVOID,GEMMACoventry
UR73390956,2010-2-August,Worst hotel I have ever stayed in. Rooms were dirty and unkempt Badly in need of refurbishment and very tiny you cant move in the bathroom (not that you would want to be in there long its dirty. Dont bother booking breakfast its a free for all. They only have seating for 110 and the hotel sleeps over 800. There was nobacon tomatoes or eggs on the first morning as they kept running out and on the second we queued for 45 mins for a table and after all that it definately was not worth waiting for. My advice stay somewhere else its awful.,suecambs
UR87615190,2010-19-November,Tired run down and dirty and thats just how i felt after staying here. This is an extremely noisy hotel doors bang all night the walls are paper thin and the old windows don't keep out the noise from the street. I was woken at 6:30am on both days by hoovering on the floor above quite ironic really given that our carpet clearly hadn't been hoovered in some time. The bathroom appeared to have seen less attention limescale and mould dominating the bath area and only overshadowed by the filthy shower curtain. Unfortunate really given that clenliness is the only prerequisite i would expect of a hotel. Should you be fortunate enough to book at the poster price of about 30 i think that's the value. i wasn't so lucky paying 80 a night for a twin room and feeling somewhat short changed. Perfect hotel for heavy drinkers who can sleep through the racket and are not put off by below par hygene levels.,eebomcmillan
UR67893870,2010-18-June,On arrival first room allocated still occupied!! 2nd tiny noisykettle missing 3rd bathroom clean shower curtain GRUBBY. One bath towel one hand towel for both of us.. Bedside cabinet nailed to wall drawer space had piece of wood nailed over. Air con. not working opened window for fresh air led to us being wakened at 12.45 when empty bottles from the bar below were emptied into a metal bin.Food OK if you like cold chips and peas. Hot drink cold drinks and snack machine not in working order. Lift out of order. Inside lift we used was like being in a Tracy Emmin sculpture assorted beverage spills decorating the walls don't even want to think what some of them were. 181.30 for two miserable nights.Never again. Staff seems discouraged and no wonder. The bear who stars in Travellodge ads. Is under threat from unhappy guests with automatic weapons!!!! Wouldnt recommend this Hotel to an enemy never mind a friend!!!!!!,crabbitandcrabbiter
UR56366941,2010-18-February,Just got back shattered! The Hotel is within walking distance of Kings Cross Station and is one of the cheaper Hotels around. However the rooms were tatty and we had a curtain missing which wasn't good seen as we were on the main road side. Bit of mould around the bath and someones used cotton bud and fluff in the heater but clean towels in the full bathroom. Loads of groups of young people booked in and the noise was hiddeous. Slamming doors running up and down the corridors shouting all night. Really no respect for other guests. Would have made sense to put them all on one floor away from families? If you are young and with a group of mates or a couple who won't sleep then it's cheap and cheerful but if you have small children or an older couple then avoid at all costs. Wish we'd stuck with Premier Inn but we live and learn!,kalaNotts
UR79904298,2010-17-September,Stayed here for one night September 15th Location ok and that is about it!! Service ok staff helpfull till things go wrong then do not want to know. Room terribly shabby sink tap corroded and would not turn from hot to cold. shower curtain mouldy. bed clean and ok. no coat hangers VERY VERY NOISY AND HOT. Now the bad part Fire Doors jammed open!!!! At breakfast the waiters had one dirty cloth and were wiping all the tables with this one dirty cloth.... I pointed out the flagrant breach of health law to her and she said ... they were new staff... i did ask if they had training and she just shrugged her shoulders and walked away. I think they get away with it as it is used by a young traveling community who do not live this country to complain. THis really makes the health situation worse as any infection will be spread far and wide. Do travel lodge wish to be assoociated with this practice!! Avoid if possible.,robhcooper123
UR83822815,2010-17-October,Well where do we start? Check in prompt efficient almost friendly... CarParking - 15 for 24 hours fine but why not tell people the telephone based system doesnt work and the machine only accepts 1 coins which the hotel reception & bar refused to change up some money to help us out From here it went down hill the lobby is tired and at the time of our arrival full of German teenages and Eastern European working girls (of reasonable quality if this makes any difference to anyone) The Lifts are creaky dirty and some considerate person had left us a sample of their KFC in there (this was at 9pm) The rooms can only be described as substandard borderline prison cell and well below any previous experience and this was based on us knowing this prior to booking! There was mould in our extractor fan a tile fell off during a shower and it looked our bathroom had played host to WWF RoyalRumble. On the plus side it was dirt cheap semi decent location and in general just about acceptable however i think the tramp in the carpark had the right idea...all the location none of the cost same standard of service,croakey243
UR58783583,2010-17-March,The staff were curt and unhelpfulthe food was 2nd rate (heard afterwoods that it was frozen and heated to serve!) the room was basic but at such a cheap price I expected that...We just did not feel welcome from our check-in until we left. It was also very cold in our room. We had just arrived in England full of the excitement of overseas travel..we certainly came down to earth with a bump when we booked in at The royal scot !!!,aussielady_10
UR56295193,2010-17-February,Well.... this hotel is kind of a dump. But conveniently located and reasonably priced (for London). Check-in and check-out were quick easy and efficient. Fairly secure - you need your key to access the lifts to the rooms. Hallways are worn and paint is peeling. Every room is an ensuite but the twin beds in our room were very narrow and hard with hard pillows. No decoration - just utilitaian white. The shower had great water power but never got warmer than tepid. Didn't have to check out until noon which was nice. Breakfast was minimal - toast jam coffee and juice. Yes it looked like hundreds of people had had breakfast before us and left their mess. But the staff was trying to keep up - clearing tables and vacuming. Overall - felt more like a hostel than a 2-3 star hotel. But it served the purpose adequately.,BoulderBaehres
UR75679549,2010-17-August,Quite simply the worst hotel experience ever - tired run down room shower didn't work room temp bordered on sub-tropical but the breakfast experience was something else. Went down at 8am - faced a queue back to lifts (approx. 50 people) took 30 minutes to clear when finally getting to table they were no clean glasses or mugs or cereal bowls or plates!!!.....staff (eastern european) couldn't care less - it was pure cattle market. Tip for budding entrepreneurs - open up a breakfast bar across the road and you will make a fortune!!!...when we returned to London 5-days later we stayed at the Premier Inn - Tower Bridge Road. What a contrast in every respect. Travelodge bosses need to get their a&^es down to this one and either shut it down or get it sorted. Its shameful.,sparkysbackpack
UR90008347,2010-16-December,Only okay if you get a really cheap deal and stay for one night. Had an awful sleep with trains going by every 3-4 mins - felt like i never slept. It was like a form of torture. Maybe there are quieter rooms on the other side ??? The room was very basic - it would give a back packer hostel a run for their money. Staff acting out there roles - just! No harm to them the hotel is rubbish really. Avoid if possible but great location if you want to catch a train - i suppose.,1-observer
UR75406536,2010-16-August,The Royal Scot Travelodge Kings Cross - what a complete dump. This hotel is the worst I and my colleague have ever experienced and the fact it has a 3 start rating is an insult to all other star rated hotels. Not only were we greeted by an awful smell when entering the rooms but my bed was made using the last occupants dirty linen. The place made me feel physically ill. I was given another room which did have clean (I hope) linen but again the room stunk was filthy noisy and uncomfortable. If we were staying any longer than the 2 nights we would have checked out immediately and thinking about it now - we should have done just that. This is the first time we have stayed at a Travelodge and it will certainly be the last. Travelodge should be ashamed of itself for offering such a disgusting place. I even hated the location Kings Cross which is a absolute dump. I should have know better to have booked it in the first place. I have written to Travelodge to complain and it will be interesting to see what kind of response I get from them. The Royal Scot should be closed down immediately as I am also concerned at the layout of the hotel. It is like a rabbit warren dark and dingy. I would hate to know what would happen in the event of a fire or other emergency. This place is a disgrace!,mkgkiwi
UR87203736,2010-15-November,The breakfast was deeply underwhelming. It was billed as a 'Full English Breakfast'. There was a decent range of cereals. But the fruit was tinned oranges or tinned grapefruit. The cooked option was pasty sausages tinned tomatoes beans and scrambled egg which had the consistency of fresh mortar. The fried bacon was OK. And people were queuing and waiting for it because there were not enough chairs and tables for the number of guests in the hotel. At least there was a rapid turnaround once people were in the restaqurant.,LoveIndia08
UR53263275,2010-12-January,I found this travelodge of very poor quality since my last visit in 2006 yes it is budget accomodation but I at least expect hot water in the rooms when the temperature outside is -6C! No hot water the room was grubby and the disposable plastic cups had been washed out we didnt even get fresh disposable cups. The reception was frezzing cold as the staf continued to leave the doorrs open in the cold snap. The bar was cold and never open. Dont bother with this hotel,skiprat_10
UR55831042,2010-12-February,My husband and I booked a 2 night stay in this hotel to celebrate my 21st birthday in London. Unfortunately I made the mistake of NOT reading the reviews for this hotel before going. As it was a Travelodge hotel I assumed standards would be the same across board and as I have had all positive experiences previously elsewhere I assumed this would be fine too... WRONG. Check in was fast and friendly. We were given a room on the 2nd floor. Upon opening the door the smell was musky. The first thing I noticed was the dated UGLY furniture. It was dirty and smelly. I pulled back the bed sheets to find they had marks all over. The bathroom was tiny and had mould in the shower. The floor was grotty and generally not cleaned. Might I also add that we booked a double room. This room had a double bed in it but it was NOT a double room. It even had the SINGLE headboard still attached to the wall. My husband went to reception and swiftly got our room changed. We were moved to the 6th floor. This time it was a double room but the room was still filthy. The cleaners obviously weren't doing their job. The wallpaper was peeling and the window was mouldy. I had also come out with bite marks on my arms and I'd only sat in the bed for a few minutes! We were not happy to stay in this hotel so we asked to be moved to another hotel. They said this would not be possible however they did offer us a full refund without us having to ask for one first. This was great as I was expecting to have to kick up a fuss. Hotel in MAJOR need of upgrading. Gutting out and cleaning BIG TIME. Just don't go here not worth it. Travelodge should be ashamed to have this 'aquired' property on it's books. We spent a while looking for another hotel but found one for similar price near Paddington station. It was a palace compared to this!,fandabbydosy
UR74760770,2010-11-August,If you're looking for cheap accomodation in a central London location this ticks the boxes. However the hotel is quite run down and the staff don't seem to quite know what's going on. First we got booked into a room that had not been cleaned and the room they moved us to had no towels. Once it all got sorted it was ok but the noise from the nearby train track kept me from sleeping very well. I guess you get what you pay for.. I probably won't return to this one but I wasn't completely horrified either.,KariJazz
UR70384722,2010-10-July,After staying in a numer of travelodges I thought this would be an ideal way to spend a few leisure days in London. The room we was given was like an oven The Air con in the room didnt work and there was no opening windows. now we know why we were given a tatty old fan as we booked in! Although we had booked into a double foom we were told" you can have a family room for more space" . well we certainly had that ! but what we didnt get was enough towels just one hand towel and one bath towel between 2 of us. but as it was late at night we managed. we had the most uncomfortable nights sleep ever. As they asked we placed the towels in the shower tray hoping for clean ones. No such lucok infact they didnt even clean our room that day. Down to reception and asked for a change of towels. not a problem. Asked what their room cleaning policy was and was told to remind them in the morning! not something we should do really is it? Final Straw. But then try and get back into the room No sorry cant do that ...... the key card dosn't work or for the other guy i spoke to! Final Final straw. demanded a change of room and was put in a much nicer room with opening windows on the top floor. No veiw but was better than the first room now the next 2 night might be better! As we searched our first room to make sure we hadn't left any thing a quick move of the settee revealed an empty water bottle. a plastic bag and used tissues. So the rooms are regularly cleaned then !!! I know there are some pretty dodgy places around Kings Cross but there is no reason for a reputable company like Trael odge to come down to their level. If this is the future standard of sevice from the compny then never again. I woldnt mind but this wasnt even one of the cheap deals this was 73/night for 3 nights. AVOID THIS HOTEL !,Sparkypaul
UR89479875,2010-10-December,it was a terrible experience from the start - greeted by "Malik" who was unfriendly surly and rude not interested in me as a customer. i was put in a room next to the elevator on the same floor as a big group of students who were noisy rowdy all night the room was old dirty and the heater was barely working so i had to sleep under both duvets from the twin beds. next morning i canceled my second night stay and stayed at the IBIS instead. the location of this hotel is misleading as there are two Travelodge Kings Cross - the Royal Scots is not royal at all in fact more like a youth hostel - tired falling apart and clearly the staff reflect the hotel state and condition. Bad value i will never stay here again and i will be put this review on trip advisor. (This is the feedback I sent to Travelodge when they asked for feedback).,huwborg
UR81697389,2010-1-October,Booked in advance very cheap but first room offered was both ancient and grotty. Staff were rude when a change was requested but a halfway decent room was the end result. Would not recommend.,Owainbrown
UR73271032,2010-1-August,Got a room that was like a large store cupboard that sounded like workmen working next door found out it was because it was next to the noisy lift got a better room when I complained that seemed like it was another hotel a lot better cleaner newer and also quieter. We opted for continental breakfast and the attitude of the staff telling us we weren't allowed to have anything hot was horrendous. If we had wanted a hot breakfast we would have ordered one. Not the usual standard I've experience before from this chain. If using Travelodge in London don't use this one.,bellysbride
UR46344610,2009-9-October,Went with a group of friends shared a room with my husband. The rooms are not cleaned bathroom was dirty and not cleaned was given dirty bath towels covered in blood - yeuck!!!! Bedroom window did not open so had no fresh air and room was very smelly also mattresses on beds were the worst ive ever slept on. Breakfast was 7.50 EACH and was cold buffett style stuff thats been sitting out for agaes. Toilets at reception were also horrific and covered in sh!t. Only good thing about this hotel was the location but id rather pay more for a cleaner hotel.,d0n81
UR34060675,2009-6-July,Have used Travelodge many times before but this one the worst.Reception staff friendly and reception area clean enough the room though needed an overhaul bathroom terrible mould in the bathroom & not really as clean as it should have been a broken bed. room previously used by a smoker although it was non smoking- the smell remained. - dismal room really. Corridors dark & dismal and need a good vacuuming. I couldn't really recommend this one.,pinkslippers
UR25658172,2009-5-March,...but I wouldn't be happy to pay more than that for this run down tip. The triple bedded room didn't have enough space for any chair or bedside table; the sink did not drain properly and someone had presumably stolen the kettle. But they did bring me a replacement after half an hour. (No phone in room so I had to go to reception to ask for it) I've stayed here twice - for 9 a night both times - the first time we all had to evacuate due to a fire alarm at 2 in the morning. The place is tatty and in dire need of a lick of refurbishment. Newer Travelodges seem to have a much higher standard. Use this place as a last resort or if you can get it for 9 and want a cheap stay in London. Oh and don't be deceived by the "Royal Scot" in the hotel name - it's quite a walk from Kings Cross station and the streets aren't particularly pleasant at night.,MikeWReading
UR31659814,2009-5-June,Tonight is my first out of 4 nites here. 1. NO PHONES in the room. So if you're a tourist and you're in some sort of trouble you're pretty much screwed getting help. 2. Even though there is an A/C unit in the room it is not operational. I went downstairs to reception (see #1!!!) to ask about it and they said none of the rooms have A/C and windows have to be opened. As I'm typing this review I can hear people yelling outside traffic buzzing etc. Good thing I have ear plugs. 3. My laptop is running off the battery right now since there is NO power to the power outlets!!! I inquire about this and supposedly a maint guy going to come by and take a look. it has been 30 min since I checked in. I am so tempted to just check out rigth now and stay somewhere else but my rates were non-refundable. I guess I just have to live with it for 4 nites. DO NOT STAY HERE AT ALL!!!!!!!!!!1,Seks
UR36603668,2009-3-August,I stayed at the Royal Scot a couple of years ago whereby I got a deal for 29 a night and it was fabulous. Clean basic fresh rooms but 2 years on .... My motto is "you get what you pay for".... well I certainly did this time. I paid 34 for a twin room (which I got) for an overnight stay en-route to Belgium near St Pancras Station. The bed was comfy the linen clean and the towels but the carpet needed a good hoover some kid had black hands and put hand prints on the walls near the tv. The tv did not work did not even switch on. The skirting boards were 2 inch thick in dust they had not seen a clean in months. The bathroom just passed for cleanliness. Disappointed. I use Travelodges alot and will not use this one again in London. Should have stopped at the Premier Inn just over the road from Kings Cross that had good reviews and would have been worth the extra 30 or so quid to 'kip in a clean room'. Most disappointed!,LadyWard1
UR50271050,2009-29-November,This hotel has the rudest person in a customer service based job that I have ever had the misfortune to encounter. She lied she accused me of lying she was obnoxious and completely incapable of working in a hotel reception. No people skills and quite clearly no ability to deal with a genuine complaint. In our brief time at the hotel I hoverheard 4 seperate people making complaints about the facilities. We had booked 3 double rooms for a family break as we were travelling seperately the others in the party arrived before my partner and I and had booked in. When we arrived we were told by the 'receptionist' that they did not have any double rooms left and that we would be in a tripple she said that if we came down before 12pm the follwing day we could change our room to a double we reluctantly accepted this and made our way to the tripple room. The room was not what we would have expected from a travelodge (see photos). The bathroom was dirty and had dirty towels that had not been removed there was a hole in the bathrooms door the grout around the bath and sink was grubby there was dry rot in the skirting and a disgusting brown build up of something unidentified around the join between the toilet and tiles we had no soap the plastic disposable cups had clearly been used by the guests before us (toothpaste stains etc) The dressing table/desk had no chair there were what looked like brown liquid stains all over the walls from top to bottom (god knows what happened in that room?!?!) there were what looked like either vomit or hot chocolate stains down the side of the tv unit and finaly there was mould around the window. DISGUSTING. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. THE PHOTOS POSTED BY OTHER REVIEWERS ARE NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF ALL THE ROOMS IN THE HOTEL. ONLY SOME OF THE FLOORS HAVE RENOVATED ROOMS. As suggested the night before we went to reception to ask for our room to be changed The receptionsist (a different one) said that this was fine and told us to pack our bags in preparation for the move. We were told to come back in the afternoon and our double room would be ready. When we returned the original rude receptionist was back on duty- to cut a very long story short - our double room was not available she denied that the person we spoke to in the morning even existed then when countered about it she said the woman didn't work there!!!! She denied that she had told us when we checked in that we could swap rooms and basically accused me of lying and making it all up. The hotel was overbooked so our option was to stay in the room we had or to find another hotel. It appeared to be ok for the hotel to give someone else the double room we had booked and paid for before arrival but she refised point blank to give us a double room that someone else had not yet booked into even although it meant splitting up a party of 6 . In the end two of us had to move to another hotel. She arranged for us to be picked up by taxi and moved to another travelodge. As it turned out the taxi was unmarked and the driver dropped us off 10mins away from the travelodge. We had no idea where we were going and had to hail a black cab to take us there. When we got to the second hotel they had no record of us being moved! We had to wait an hour before the deputy manager was able to give us a room. He had to sort out the mess. I am not fussy I expect a room of the standard that is being paid for we paid 59 per night (room only) cheap by London standards. I was not expecting a palace but I was expecting to get a double room get a clean room and have staff treat me with a bit of respect and dignity as a paying customer.,LozHammersbaws
UR28915822,2009-28-April,I have stayed in some decent Travelodges but this one was shabby run down and dirty. Noisy rooms and constantly full of noisy school trips who block entrances and lift access. No better than a hostel. We had a triple bedded small room which didn't have enough space for any chair or bedside table. No phone. Broken toilet roll holder. Air conditioning didn't work. Not a good experience and we didn't stay the full length of our booking..,Darlo_ManUK
UR33290457,2009-27-June,I booked this hotel as my husband and I had an early Eurostar train to catch the next day. We arrived at 1pm with our heavy backpacks hoping out room would be ready (it was a business day - usually people check out early so rooms would be available). We were told that we would need to pay 10 more to check in 2 hours early. The room was sitting waiting and we have to pay extra? (That option was not there when we booked the room months ago!). There was nowhere to leave luggage so as we refused to pay we had to take them with us. (BTW Kings Cross charge 8 per item so if they point you in that direction I wouldn't bother). We arrived back later having done what we needed to in the day and checked in. We asked for a quiet room so were given one facing the back street. It was noisy but with the windows closed it was ok to sleep just with no air con it was very very hot! The bed seemed comfortable and pillows ok. Ensuite you could barely stand in they are so tiny. Shower was ok and powerful enough. We had to be up at 6 so we tried to have an early night and were suprised that the hotel seemed quiet at 11 at night.....we thought we were going to be lucky. But no come midnight the loud party-goers returned to the hotel (bearing in mind we stayed on a Tuesday night we were not expecting much loud behaviour!). Instead of returning quietly and going to their rooms they were talking loudly and shouting down the hallways and slamming their doors. This continued as each room returned until gone 3 in the morning - that was 3 hours lost sleep. The walls to the room seem paper-thin also. I could hear people talking in their rooms who were two rooms away! I could also hear the people in the next room (who seemed to be quiet and like us trying to get rest) use the toilet.... lovely! We finally got some sleep and were woken up at 5.30 with the first person leaving - and slamming their doors (probably in protest of the inconsidereate people who returned late and made as much noise as they could). The location is fine 5-10 mins walk from Kings Cross - though the street is absolutely fine in the day - not sure I would want to walk it in the dark evenings in winter.... All in all I would spend a little more and stay somewhere nicer. Book early and get a decent hotel if you need to rest as its a complete waste of money staying here..... not to mention stressful!,GBland
UR33217491,2009-26-June,This was the only hotel I could get in this area for less than 100 a night which was pretty much my budget for a one-night stay. I arrived initially at the hotel in between meetings and was told you can't check in until 3pm otherwise you have to pay an additional 10. I didn't really want to pay any more - not sure why when your room is ready you can't just check-in. There was also no space to leave luggage at reception so had to lug it all around with me to my meetings all afternoon until I could go back. When I did eventually check-in the reception staff were quick efficient friendly and helpful which did calm my mood slightly! My room faced over the back of the hotel which overlooked other guest rooms. There are no privacy curtains so you have to hide in your room to get changed or get dressed in the dark (you could of course turn the lights on and shut the curtains but pretty sad on a bright sunny day!) The room was clean and tidy and a good size however the bed was shocking!!! It was so soft it felt like it collapsed beneath me when I sat down and I'm only 9st! Not a very good night's sleep. Also be careful when leaving your room - as other reviewers have pointed out you have to slam the door to make it shut properly. I tried to be quiet and close the door softly but it didn't lock!! Lucky I checked it otherwise I would have been away all evening with an open door!! The main positive is location - just 5-10 minute walk to Kings Cross station so easy to get around London and onto mainline trains. Don't think I would choose this hotel again - would try a nicer hotel instead if I can get a better price. In all fairness the price I paid was 79 but once you add breakfast (about 6) Wi-Fi access at 10 for 24 hours and early/flexible check-in at 10 you might as well stay at a better hotel which has these things as standard.,Jenny077
UR30725529,2009-25-May,Me and a friend stayed at this hotel as a treat after a night out in London. We checked in quite late and they had no room for us or another up to 20 people. After a 3 hour wait we were shown to a room. We stay in hotels quite often and the test is to have a check of the shower and the toilet. This we did and they were both disgisting there was also a smear just above the bed which looked brown and I shudder to think what it was! We compalined and then after another 2 hour wait we were shown to a replacement room. By this time we were so tired and so decided to stay anhd not even look at the toilet! We went to bed and we both felt things crawling on us I got up and went into the bathroom I saw visable bugs as big as my small finger nail crawling all over me I had risen bites everywhere too. I ran down to the reception area in my underwear to show them and they were so shocked and offered me a doctor. I have uploaded some pictures of the bites of 3 days later... they should be shut down disgusting I could have caught anything!!,Dont-trip-up
UR49589347,2009-19-November,The single beds in this place are no wider than 2 and a 1/2 foot the mattress is made out of what felt like 3 blankets layered on top of each other. The staff are pathetic they didnt have a clue about anything. The noise from outside traffic was unbearable too. They charge 1.00 for 20 minutes of internet. Rip off. The bathroom was built for the Hobbits come to think about it so was the bloody bed. Avoid. Avoid. Avoid. Avoid. Avoid. Avoid.,MusicMan54
UR24715335,2009-18-February,Booked late and wouldnt normally use TL but it was convenient to our visit. Wallpaper torn lights wonky showing wiring dirty rads others hair in the bath!!! Disgusting. It was quiet well situated and slept ok. The auto main doors to TL wouldnt close so breakfasted in coats as it was so cold. Wont be back to that or any other TL!,TopseyWiltshire
UR47091532,2009-17-October,Stayed at the Travel Lodge Royal Scots on the 9th October for 2 nights with my husband brother and sister-in-law.... Hotel is not the best looking Hotel and looks rather dingy..a bit grubby in the lobby and not very well lit. Check in was quick and after being directed to our rooms we went for the lift ( no stairs) 2 lifts ( 3rd one out of order)that need to be up dated our room was on the 2nd floor but after getting out of the lift and following directions we ended up in what only can be described as the basement.... however even though on street level there was no noise. The bedroom was small but the bed and bedding were spotless the bathroom was in need of up dating even a bit of grout in the tiles would of made a difference on the whole not a bad place to stay would stay again..... its not 3* as described for value its o.k ...easy to get to the tube and taxi's are just as cheap to travel by  the tube to the west end would cost 4 of us 16 it only cost us 8 in a taxi....,bb1Liverpool
UR30099171,2009-16-May,The rooms are small compared to other Travelodges it's not very clean and needs decorating. It's very noisy people in the corridor sound like they're in your room and all of the doors require to be slammed to be closed causing more noise. Spend a little more and stay somewhere else.,Cumbrians_7
UR51271406,2009-15-December,This hotel needs a complete rebfurb. Its old tired dirty. The decor in the room left a lot to be desired. The lamps was falling off the wall the paint was peeling. It looked as if the skirting board had been hit with a Hoover and had a bit chunk out of it. The bathroom was tiny but actually quite clean. The bed had the thinnest duvet on it. The staff was completely unhelpful. I had no phone in the room so had to go back to reception to ask for an iron/ironing board and was informed they had non available but might have some back in 1/2 hour - I asked if I could put my name down for one and was told no it was on a first come first served basis. 65 for a double room is a disgusting price for a shabby hotel like this - and no breakfast either - wish I had stayed somewhere else - definitely would not go back,sazbox
UR37770360,2009-15-August,I phoned travelodge to book a cheap overnight stay whilst visiting London to see Oliver in the West End. The location of the hotel suited our needs well as it was only a 20 minute walk to the theatre and as we were watching the midday performance we felt it was easy to walk there and back. The room was disappointing as I have stayed in Travelodge's before and always been satisfied. As mentioned most of the staff were foreign and this gave the impression of rudeness due to the lack of understanding. Our room was very cramped and the twin beds might as well have been a double as the beds were so close together. My bed felt like it was going to collapse each time I rolled over. The day we stayed was a hot day and the ventillation in the room was awful due to the fact that the window would only open about 2 inches. The worst was the doors to the rooms as you had to slam them to shut them even if you tried to shut them quietly they banged. I was kept awake for a lot of the night by the doors banging in the corridor and the air conditioning unit for the cafe/bar. I'd recommend this to someone who wanted to have a cheap stay in London with a good location but would warn them not to expect much. Be warned that the hotel is just inside the congestion charging zone and to use the hotels small dingy carpark you have to drive about 3 metres into the zone which means you have to pay the charge or be stumped with a heavy fine.,tree9_99
UR23460533,2009-11-January,Would not stay there again. Far from city center and attractions. Very small rooms clogged and dirty bathrooms. Poor service. Good breakfast. Try to avoid this hotel.,SanJuanInbox
UR46458446,2009-10-October,Title says it all do not stay here! Dirty smelly and staff couldn't care less.,Elvisthegrey
UR20694551,2008-7-October,Stayed in this hotel for one night before using eurostar. Let me start with the good points: Location Now for the stuff that was not so good: Couldnt sleep due to constant trains noise throughout the night (to be fair they did have a warning on the website) but the noise was tremendously loud. The room was small dirty and dated. The window was single glazed and had no curtains which made the room really cold and the electric radiator was useless. The bathroom was small filthy and very basic. i.e no shampoo's etc. Considering we paid 87 for one night that is not value for money. They provided two small hand towels in the bathroom in a double room. it was like trying to get dry with a napkin. This is the worst excuse for a hotel i have ever witnessed in my life and had i been staying for longer i would have complained or simple found somewhere else to stay.,Namsey
UR17608378,2008-7-July,My husband and I stayed for one night before getting the Eurostar the next morning. All I can say the place was dirty. The lift doors looked they had been cleaned with dirty water. The bar area looked shabby and there was no way I was eating there. Our room was so tiny I kept tripping over things as there wasn't enough room to walk. Room was shabby and wanted a good clean. Wouldn't stay there if I was being paid to.,SkegnessSeashell
UR22466848,2008-5-December,Like another writer we booked a Travelodge because we thought you knew what you were going to get when you did so - simple but adequate bedrooms meticulous cleanliness and a good breakfast on site or next door. Our room was a nice one - but the heater was broken and the secondary glazing wouldn't stay shut letting in a lot of street noise and cool air. The bathroom basin was cracked too. But the public parts of the hotel were what disappointed - inadequate lifts in shabby condition (with 2 out of the 3 out of order during most of our stay); a cold lobby totally inadequate for the number of people who gathered there - it was often jammed with queues from coach parties. (The automatic doors to the street seemed to jam on Open.) Totally inadequate breakfast accommodation which was caused long queues to form in the cold lobby and caused you to have to search for empty chairs and carry them to your table. Be warned - this is not the right hotel if you are looking for a restful haven from the hustle of a weekend in London or a place to get a bit of work done between appointments. A large part of the clientele was made of coach parties of noisy - though not in our experience rowdy - crowds of teenagers. To repeat the room was basically OK and the food provided for breakfast was OK too - but it just wasn't what you'd expect from a Travelodge.,R0ckw00d
UR18654464,2008-5-August,if your young i do not reccomend this hotel. i had paid online for a room and went to check inn and was straightaway accused of fraud. i was being shouted and sworn at front of his other colleauges by the deputy manager then took my bank card to the staff room and checked by contacting the bank and found out it was not fraud and that it really was my card. he then came back to me and gave the card and did not even aplogise. i then asked him what happened he then replied 'come out i'l sort you out' he was threatening to fight me. his colleage then refused to let me use their phone to call the police. i was absoultley disgusted of the way i was being treated.,anoyn
UR19777481,2008-4-September,Like a few others we found the wrong Travelodge in King's Cross first. We were directed to the correct property. When we arrived the lobby was a madhouse. I think a tour bus had just arrived. Check in seemed very chaotic. We were assigned a two twin bed room and requested a double. Unfortunately we were denied. Since it was just one night we decided not to fight it. The room was located on the second floor and directly above a dumpster in the alley behind. There were two old and broken air conditioning units in the room. We knew the hotel didn't have air conditioning but were suprised to see these old broken units. There was no phone or clock in the room. There was a small 13" TV that was supposed to have a clock/alarm feature that didn't work. The bed linens seemed clean. The window opened both at the top and bottom but didn't close completely. Overall the room was very run down and seemed quite dingy. There were three elevators that held two people and luggage comfortably but they were extremely slow. In the morning as people started walking through the hallway the door on the room rattled every time someone walked by. There is a restaurant/bar in the lobby but we did not eat there. For the price in London it was to be expected but if given the choice I would not stay here again.,seedergirl
UR16509353,2008-30-May,Found a great offer on a triple room on the travelodge website and i can see why it's so cheap. Pros: 1) 10 minute walk to Kings Cross underground/St Pancras. 2) the bar looked impressive although i admit i didn't use it. Cons: 1) reception refused to let us leave our bags behind the desk in the morning so we had to carry them round all day (3pm earliest checkin) 2) the elevators and corridor walls are disgusting. 3) the walls in our very small room were dirty. 4) the toilet roll holder had been ripped off the toilet was dirty and the shower head was diconnected. for the price and the fact it was just a bed to sleep on i suppose this did the trick anything else and avoid at all costs,ricomc
UR13946746,2008-29-February,Terrible Hotel rooms were small and clean but noisy. First room we had had a screeching pipe noise every 10 minutes next room on fifth floor was even worse - dirty undecorated - the entire floor looked like it was a completly different hotel that Travel Lodge had forgot about! Final room we had was on third floor better but again small grubby and so noisey really lound doors banging pipes creaking and even the lift made a nosie. Staff were helpful but would not recommend this even for 30 per night!!!,JPG074
UR23085064,2008-29-December,We booked this travelodge as an overnight stay so that we could see the lights for Christmas. We paid 19 per triple room per night. We got what we paid for - basic accommodation in quite a central location. The triple rooms are tiny and not really suitable to accomodate three beds - dread to think how packed it would be with three adults. The decor was very run down the sink had a massive crack in it. Overall very run down. But it was 19 per night it was cleanish the bed was very narrow but fairly comfortable. Wouldn't chose to stay there again wouldn't recommend it and was quite disappointed that it was part of the Travelodge chain. Luckily our kids didn't notice any of this and still had a lovely time in London - so there you go!,travellingmumof3
UR13042167,2008-27-January,This hotel is appalling - do not stay! We were here for one night 3 of us and we had a triple roon. The space between each bed was less than 50cm. There was no room and we were stumbling over each other. The bathroom was horrendous im not a snob in the slightest but when it comes to a hotel i expect decent basics - a clean bed (mine was damp) a decent sized bathroom (this bathroom was so small the door only opened 90 degrees) and good service. We were greeted by a very unhelpful receptionist who couldnt find our booking by our names made me pay 1 to use the internet and then found it under our address. The lifts were fulll of someones take-out wrappings our room ont eh 4th floor was right next to a swing door which was constantly being swung open - you could get no sleep! I paid 2 for a coffee fromt he machine in the reception for there to be no cups in the dispenser. I told the staff receptiionist about this who offered me a watered down coffee from the bar - no refund!! I would not recommend travelodge at all!,pickytravelbags
UR15408015,2008-27-April,i have just returned from a university reunion in London staying just the one night in this hotel as we couldnt get into the kings cross station travelodge. We had 2 triple rooms booked on the 4th floor. 3 of us went to check into our room on one side of the floor and the others on the otherside. To our dismay the room i had the key card to had been occupied and i walked straight in on someone elses room! we then went to find our friends to find they had the same problem however the young lady that was staying in that room on her own came back to the room to find 3 of them sitting on her bed. She was mortified to think that all her stuff was in there and we had a room key! we all went to recepetion to complain to a very un appologetic receptionist. From then on we were worried about the safety of our belongings and on tenderhooks thinking some stranger could walk in on us at anytime! The room was less than basic very cramped strange smell only 2 towels even though its a triple room one very flat pillow each and not even a chair i thought that was standard even for Travelodge's! In the morning checkout was not till 12 noon so we took advantage and tried to have a lie in to only be disturbed twice by to maids trying to clean our room surely they know if we have checked out or not! From about 8am in the morning all you can hear are the awful heavy doors banging from below and above and making the room just shake! All in all i know they are budget hotels but this one is well below travelodge standards and needs some serious attention dont bother staying there!,Extremelyhonest
UR14497970,2008-24-March,I was unable to book the other Travelodge in Kings Cross so booked this place instead. The Royal Scot has always had a bad reputation but I assumed that it had been upgraded was I wrong! It is a total disgrace I didn;t even have a chair in the room or a plug in the snk! The carpet was torn and frayed and the furniture was at least 30 years old. I paid 81 and would have been better off booking a cheap hotel in the streets off Kings Cross. I am amazed that anyone can say they had a good time.,colmil
UR22980140,2008-24-December,Before you book with Travelodge this is what you need to know: your credit card will be charged in advance and you may not see your full amount refunded if you cancel. I booked a week at this location more than a month in advance of my trip. When my travel plans changed I went online to cancel. I tried calling customer support but never was able to get through. When I canceled the reservation online I was refunded my total minus a booking fee of 1.50 which is legit and 20 for wifi access which is not. There was nothing on the booking form to indicate that wifi services would be unrefundable. When I contacted Travelodge by email they said I could use the services on a future trip. Since this is a one time trip to London from the US I doubt very much I'll ever use this service. I'm contesting this now but know before you book that you will be charged in advance that there may be hidden fees and that their customer service is not easily accessible especially if you're not in the UK.,carolgonyc
UR19276922,2008-23-August,I've stayed at this hotel on many occasions before and it has been adequate - you get what you pay for! But this last stay was very disappointing; entrance lobby/porch littered with debris and glass doors smeared and dirty. Lifts - smelly and very hot brass wall panels filthy and litter in corners of lift compartment. Room small with not much space to move around and no storage space for more than 1 bag; fairly clean apart from the bathroom which had black marks in the corners of the wall tiles around the bath. Tea and coffee facilities (mugs tea coffee etc.) but no kettle. Repeated requests to bored receptionists eventually produced one 30 hours later! Customer care doesn't seem to be a priority here! Breakfast; endless queues coffee/tea machines out of order and so on. I don't think the food hygiene training was being followed by the kitchen staff - fresh food was being tipped on top of the stale food in the dishes on the buffet. I would suggest going to one of the several cafe's between the hotel and Kings Cross Station where you will get a freshly cooked English breakfast for less than the hotel charges.,CalBristol
UR14750355,2008-2-April,Staying at this hotel It has really made me realise that you get what you pay for. I paid 29 for one night and 49 each for two further nights and had 3 bad nights sleep. The Beds were terrible - soft like an airbed that is under inflated. They seemed to be old and had no spring left in them. Long overdue for replacement. Reception were helpful and after some persistance let us view other rooms. We looked at 6 other beds in total and picked the best of a very bad bunch but later found that even though it had a bit more life in it than the others it had horrendous roll together. On the first night we were kept awake in the early hours by groups talking in loud voices in the corridors and outside the lifts. I could hear the people in the next room using the loo as I laid in bed trying to sleep!! We slept better on the second night thanks to being so tired only to be woken early by housekeeping knocking on the door even though we put the appropriate sign on the door asking not to be disturbed. On the third morning we were hoping for a bit of a lie in before we went for our train only to be evacuated for a fire alarm about 8am. We were left to stand outside without any commumication from staff. The Hotel room was small - this I accept. The bathroom was miniscule and impracticle. It was acceptably clean. The hotel seemed to have a lot of international teenager/student groups staying. I believe this led to some of the problems we had i.e noise on the corridors and false fire alarms. If a hotel is used mainly by couples and families these issues may not have arisen. In summary I wont be using Travelodge again and will spend a bit more to get a better night sleep. I accept that the room is a budget room and space is a premium. However a bed in reasonable condition is a must.,garlinda1
UR13667821,2008-19-February,I cannot begin to even touch surface on all of the vices of this hotel. Here are the top 10 reasons why you should NOT stay here. 10. Beware if you need 2 rooms. They put us on two different floors at opposite ends of the hotel. I used my pedometer to count the steps- it was 450 each way to our other room! Not on. 9. Rooms are small. There was not enough room to even put our luggage down. 8. The hotel is actually the remnants of an old one. There are no safes in the rooms (although there are instructions on how to use the non-existent ones from the previous hotel). 7. Fittings are old. The bathroom is dirty and not very well kept. There are no phones so beware if you need to talk to reception 6. The staff are horrid. They just don't care about their customers. 5. The room doors are heavy and loud. They must literally make a noise above 80dB when closed. 4. It's located in a VERY grungy and run-down part of town. NOT for tourists. 3. It's about 1km to the tube stop. Not very convenient at all. 2. Our bedsheet had BLOODSTAINS on it. When we informed the reception they didnt do anything. We had to go three times before they took any action. Furthermore one of our beds was BROKEN and needed to be 'inspected' before they could change it. Since we were there for only 2 nights we figured it wouldn't be worth the hassle of changing rooms. 1. What more must I say? Don't stay here!!!!,poseidon_paterson
UR19114894,2008-19-August,Never stayed in a travelodge hotel before but I now know why the other budget hotel chain is called "Premier" and I HAVE stayed with them many times. To be fair I did only pay 19 for one night but it also cost me a whopping 81 for the first night. Could not leave bags at the hotel before and prior the booking which was very inconvenient and poor customer service. They were prepared to let you check in early/out late for an additional 10 which is helpful in view of their very late check in time of 3pm. (It's only 6.50 to leave your bags at King's Cross for 24 hours) There was no literature in the hotel room to advise of hotel services and having treked to the hotel reception for an iron was offered the iron only not the board. Welcome to the 21st century. In addition there was only one set of towels in the room so another trip to the reception was necessary so check before you shower! This is a budget hotel and as far as I could tell this was an ex Thistle hotel but appeared clean enough. 19 was an excellent rate for this hotel but 81 was not. Other budget chains offer far better value!,Sland2000
UR17934751,2008-16-July,I was staying at the Royal Scott for 5nights whilst in London the room was 81 a night for a triple. The Hotel exterior looks pretty grubby and the inside fairs no better i'm afraid. Once checked in we went to our room the room was so small it was actually hard trying to walk in straight with your bags the room was very clean but was kinda grotty there were all these stains on the walls like water or something- I don't know and the Furniture and Fixtures were almost all falling apart. The electricity went in our room three times until we figured out it was the electric kettle- we didn't get a replacement. The room was so small and very stuffy even with the window opened all night it was hard to sleep comfortably on the last night as we were going out the room door wouldn't close properly a key card had to be put in the side to close the now broken lock as it was jutting out to much for the door to close. The hotel is clean but is in need of some serious updating asap once the problems were reported to reception they were addressed to straight away. But I wouldn't really recomened this hotel as I feel it is not worth the price you pay for it. I would however recommend the Travel Lodge- Kings Cross(not Royal Scott) it seems to be an overall better standard of hotel and is nearer to Kings Cross Station.,Max2008Dublin
UR15897412,2008-10-May,I'll start with the good parts: we got a very cheap deal on our triple room the beds were comfy and clean. The general state of the room was a bit tatty - black mould in the corners of the shower; a hole ripped in the hand-towel; a broken pedestal bin; missing parts from the 'converter' that swaps between shower and bath. The staff I have to say were worse than useless. On the second day we had to re-book in... not that this has been mentioned. But anyway our keycard didn't work fair enough. We were on the fifth floor. It took me 4 trips back and forth to reception before one of them actually came up with me (very reluctantly) to 'test' our card - and had to let us in with the master key. No explanation as to why it didn't work merely that we could get it re-programmed again when we came back down... just like the other 3 times... Walls are very very thin the italian students next door woke us up both nights. The curtains don't fit the windows properly meaning that in the bed next to the window you get the sun on your face at a very early hour argh. We ordered pizza from the bar downstairs and it was completely disgusting so something to avoid. I didn't mind the general area but if i had been alone I would have felt quite unsafe.,bekajwp
UR16553531,2008-1-June,I brought my family to London for a two night stay and was a bit worried after reading some of the reviews of this place. For a cheap hotel it is conviently close to Kings Cross tube station which made getting about easy. The bar area was nice although the food wasnt. The room was decent and clean enough for the price we paid but the corridors and lifts were a bit mucky and people were running around at night time which didnt help me get to sleep. All in all though I would recomend this place as long as you dont mind roughing it a bit. The area isnt the best but I wouldnt say it was rough after reading some of the reviews I think some people must be be scared of their own shadow.,SpudManchester
UR11299387,2007-7-December,I knew it was cheap and cheerful but I got more than I bargained for when the "help" helped themselves to my toiletries and hairbrush and who knows what else! I had some lovely long black hairs to contend with on my hairbrush when I got out of the shower(my hair is short and blonde!) and I had to throw out all the stuff that I had left in the room while we were out shopping(lip gloss mascara moisturiser toothbrush etc. etc. I reported it to reception(with the evidence - hairs in a tissue) but the only response I got was that they would speak to housekeeping. When we were checking out there was no resolution as the housekeeper in question was off. I was offered a follow up phone call but really what good is that? To be honest I was so disgusted that I would never contemplate staying in a Travelodge again even if they had offered me a free stay or something. Overall the place was very scruffy and the bar was filthy with tastless beer so I certainly wouldn't recommend it anyway.,chelseagirl2
UR6552130,2007-4-January,It's ok as a couple I'm sure. Rooms are basic (mine was quite shabby) bed kettle tv bathroom. But you are not paying for any frills. However I got hassled by tramp hanging about in the carpark on the way into the hotel. The hotel itself was full of really pissed students yelling all night (on my corridor) which is to be expected I suppose since they do very cheap room deals. I was trying to get some sleep and attempted to contact reception via phone (big fight in my corridor outside my door) to find that you cannot direct dial reception they expect you to go there in person (cost saving measure) and had to use my mobile to ring an 0870 number etc. Only 2 staff on at night undertrained and scared of troublemakers so no help. If I had been with another person it would have been less scary.,EllenUk
UR8253167,2007-29-July,We stayed here for the second 3 nights of a 6 night stay in London. On first impressions the lobby and bar of the hotel looked good. Nothing amazing but your standard Travelodge type hotel. It was clean modern and looked to be well maintained. We checked in and were directed to our room which was on the 2nd floor. We took the very slow smelly and rickety lift up to the 3nd floor and set off down a long corridor. When we found our room we were surprised to find we were back at street level. The road next to the hotel is on a slope so we were on what was really the ground floor of the back part of the building. Bit unsettling to have people walking past your bedroom window peering in as they do so but we weren't planning to spend much time in the room so we could cope with this. The room was surprisingly tatty. I've stayed in lots of Travelodges and they are usually boring but comfortable...you know the kind of thing....matching curtains bedspreads and cushions and boring paintings on the wall but generally clean and modern. This room was very mismatched with old tatty furniture and shabby curtains. It didn't seem very clean but this could have just been that the furnishings and curtains etc were so old. The bathroom was the biggest shock though...a tiny poorly lit room with no window a smell of drains and very dirty mouldy shower curtain. The shower badly needed replacing and barely trickled. The grouting around the tiles was black and above the sink the mirror had been yanked off the wall leaving a huge rectangle of exposed cement. I hated going in the bathroom and would just race to get showered so I could get out of there again! There were a lot of large groups of European school kids there when we stayed and they all seemed to have free reign to run up and down the corridors screaming and banging all day and night which was annoying. I suppose in such a huge hotel you are always going to get some annoying guests but it would be good if the management tried to clamp down on behaviour which ruins everyone elses stay. The immediate area is OK not as dodgy as some people have said. There are a lot of tourists and students around and I never felt unsafe even walking back from Kings Cross station late at night. Although I was with my boyfriend I don't think I would have been too worried on my own either. It's well lit and there always seemed to be people around even late at night. It's about a 10 minute walk to Kings Cross and there are lots of cafes pubs and shops on the way. Kings Cross is obviously a big station with good tube links to the rest of London which meant getting into central London was quick and easy. I would stay there again if I got a really cheap rate but would make sure I got a different room. Judging by other reviews on here we must have got one of the worst rooms. The staff were friendly and helpful and the location is good but if I had to stay in the same room as last time I wouldn't go back in a million years!,Jen1978
UR8247968,2007-28-July,I booked this hotel for one night as I was taking my daughter to the theatre as a 18th birthday treat and travel lodges are generally the same basic comfortable and good value. I read the reviews after booking (I would normally do this first) but I trusted travel lodges. I must admit I was quite worried bringing my daughter to this hotel after reading the reviews she is a very young 18 year old and was already fretting over going on the tube (her fear was because of the previous terror attacks) and I wanted her first visit to London and the theatre to be a memorable experience for the right reasons. We were given a room in the millenium block and it was awful it was on ground level with a view of the side street where anyone can look in I closed the curtains and kept them shut. Wallpaper was peeling off it was dull and could do with brightening up we hated it but decided to make the most of it as we were only sleeping there for one night and would be out for most of the time. We returned from the theatre by tube and the walk to the hotel was not pleasant there were a few drunks along the way and a few dodgy looking people which scared us both and made us feel very vulnarable but we just linked arms and walked a little faster when we arrived back to the hotel a note had been put under the door saying we were being moved to another room due to maintance problems so at 11.00pm we got our things and went to reception where we were given another room and complimentary breakfast in the morning. Our new room was on the 6th floor and I must admit it was a room that I would expect from a travel lodge and 100% better than our orignal room. We enjoyed our stay there but only because of the room change the complementary breakfast was not the best breakfast and I certainly would not have paid 7.50 for it. I would stay there again if I was guaranteed a room like the second one if we had stayed in the millenium room I definetly would not ever book this hotel again.,natantkas
UR10005515,2007-26-September,opted for this hotel because of the location and had an early start the following day. on arriving at the hotel the reception desk staff were terrible in finding my reservation. when i got to the room the air conditioning vent was broken and was leaking down the wall something which the hotel was aware of because buckets had been placed on the floor to collect the water. I asked to be moved to another room and was told that maintenance would need to investigate the problem first. having taken my bags with me to a restaurant for dinner I returned to find the problem had not been dealt with. After complaining again I was told the hotel was fully booked a short argument later with the receptionist (who had to go and ask someone else everytime I asked him a question) and they managed to find a room (miraculously!). This room was in urgent need of redecorating but what made it worse and resulted in me leaving the hotel and finding another hotel in the city was the damp on the walls in the bathroom and the hair left in the bed as though the bed had simply been re-made after the previous guests had left!,999994
UR6612610,2007-17-January,I have stayed in plenty of travelodges and never had the need to complain but this one should be demolished . The staff should all go on a re-training course on GOOD customer service. It was my first visit to the capital and most probably my last after this experience. I have housed my dog in kennels that are cleaner than this hotel and she has been better looked after!!!!!!!!!.How on earth they have the cheek to charge 70 a night is beyond me I would of had a better nights sleep with the tramps that were dossing in the carpark. If you have to go to london you will be better off staying in nicer accomdation on the outskirts and commuting into london and it will be a lot cheaper you have to pay a 15 charge to get out of the the carpark!! Never again.,LESLEY27
UR11634529,2007-17-December,First impression was that the location was good the standard of the hotel pretty standard for a city travelodge. Unfortunately we were kept awake until the early hours and then woken again very early morning (before 6am) by load noises made by the hotels obviously old or faulty water/heating pipes so only had a little undisturbed sleep. Informed reception and was asked to contact the Manager to discuss. Sent an e-mail/rang Manager as wanted to inform them so problem could be rectified but we got NO REPLY at all assume if they could not be bothered to reply to us they probably had not done anything to check or rectify the problem.,honestreviewer2
UR8725519,2007-16-September,Based on a suggestion in a posting through Trip Advisor we booked a room here We needed one room for one night where we could bring a very large puppy that was traveling wtih us. The three best things I can say are: 1) we arrived late and the room we had prepaid for (at a decent rate) was still available; 2) they do allow pets of any size: 3) the bedding appeared clean. Those things being said the rooms are TINY. You can only get on the bed from one side the other side is pushed up against the wall. We had planned to have the pup sleep on the bathroom floor but there was hardly any floor space beneath the toilet let alone extra for a large pup. No assistance at the desk "I'm alone here I can't help you." I had several large pieces of luggage and my big puppy and many oafs were sitting around the lobby who could have chosen to assist me but alas chose not to. Another person appeared at the desk who finally did help me to the room. We asked them to stash the large kennel we were dragging with us and they said they would put it in a storage room. It was virtually in the lobby the next morning when we went to retrieve it; could have easily been stolen. No phone no chairs no amenities whatsoever in the room all in the name of saving the customer money. Breakfast wasn't available until 7 am at 7.95 pounds (pricey for a budget hotel) Rooms facing the street (which we had) were EXTREMELY noisy. We were on the 5th floor and people outside were just screaming all night - sometimes on purpose or so it seemed. Do you need a room in London near the underground in which you can bring a pet? Then this is your hotel. I would not recommend staying here on holiday for any more than one night. It is just not comfortable or easy or fun. But it serves the purpose of a place to flop for a night in London with a pet.,Blurrie
UR8703383,2007-12-September,I spend a few days in London with my teen daughters while travelling Europe on a budget each summer and we usually stay at this hotel. The price is excellent - if you can get the 26 pound special. This year we got a room that had been renovated - new carpet new white quilt covers (not the typical Travelodge blue checks) and white walls. Things were looking up. However on our 6pm arrival there was no power in the room. So I complained and was told it would be fixed in half an hour. We went out for the evening but on our return at 10:30 there was still no power. So I complained again and was told - half an hour. At 11pm I got a little angry complained at reception in a loud voice and sat there until an employee was dispatched to fix the problem! By midnight power was restored. (It was an issue because we needed to charge camera video and phone.) Also if you are returning to this hotel at night from Central London take the number 73 bus (from Victoria Marble Arch and Oxford Circus) two stops after Kings Cross (that's on Pentonville Road). Cross the road and cut down Weston Rise... and you are outside the hotel! It took us three years to find this short-cut.,AlexFamily
UR7587493,2007-11-May,Last time I went to London I stayed at the Farringdon Travelodge which is about 1/4 mile up the road from the Kings Cross Royal Scot Travelodge. As Royal Scot Travelodge is closer to King Cross Tube Station I booked it for a 2 night stay. I think it's fair to say I made an error in judgement. At check-in we were given room 2016 in the 'Millennium Rooms' section of the hotel. The name suggested modernity and grandeur but as this was a Travelodge I didn't have any expectations beyond something at least half-decent. The room was quite a trek from the reception desk and we joked that it was probably quicker to walk to the Farringdon branch. The distance through the labyrinthine corridors and down an eerie stairwell felt like the 1/4 mile we thought we'd save to our tired legs by coming to this hotel. Worse was to come when we went into the room which overlooked a sort of car park/courtyard (but more about that later). First a description of the room: I say 'room' but it felt more like a tomb. An airless smelly oppressive cave deep beneath a mountain of concrete. Worse was to come the first time I went into the bathroom. All the oxygen seemed to have been sucked out of the air and replaced by an unpleasant odour. I lifted the toilet lid and it looked clean enough in fact it was gleaming white. But a closer look revealed something brown lurking at the bottom just out of reach of a toilet brush. This was going to be weird. After a terrific and exhausting night out we made our way back to the hotel anticipating a restful night's sleep and lots of wandering round London the next day. Unfortunately we were woken by an almighty noise outside our window at about 7.00am. Our room overlooked a car park/delivery area and a lorry came to make an early-morning delivery. This lasted for 1/2 hour or so and we couldnt get back to sleep. On our way out later that morning we mentioned it to the receptionist who looked bemused for a moment before assuring us it wouldnt happen the next day. But it did. Same time same almighty noise. My girlfriend went and complained while I tried and failed to get back to sleep. She returned shortly after having been compensated by the receptionist with 2 breakfast vouchers. I use the term 'breakfast' but it was an assortment of charred greasy lumpy bits of stuff. The croissants were stale the juice sour the water had a strange unidentifiable metallic taste. It was supposed to be free but I paid quite a high price with the indigestion that followed. There's a certain grim fascination to be found in places like this but it isn't for the faint of heart (or nose) (or ears). The sheer wrongness of the place compelled me to stay for the entire 2 nights to see how much worse it could get. I at least would have a bizarre tale to tell my friends in the pub: 'You wouldnt believe the place I stayed in!',Dave33Birmingham
UR8687751,2007-10-September,Booked on-line at saver rate but the room we got was in the basement and was very "tired". After complaining we had another room issued and was up to Travelodge standard ! NO chairs in any of the rooms so you had to stand or sit on the bed! Location is convenient for Kings Cross rail station and London underground. Food in cafe is only very average,JayDee1939
UR5924955,2006-7-October,The room was fine (reading earlier reviews I think it must have been refurbished) & overlooked a flat roof at the back of the building so was actually fairly quiet. The reception-bar is also OK (& more than you would normally find in a Travelodge) However the area is really grotty. I walked from Kings Cross at about 10 at night & was really glad to arrive at the door. I managed to book the room for 26 & I think that's about what it's worth.,angwri
UR5921679,2006-6-October,London hotel prices are generally extortionate and so it is great that Travelodge do rooms for 70 per night. However ours was in need of some attention. Fair play to the room attendants it was clean. But there was wallpaper peeling off the carpets were worn the windows mouldy and the air-conditioning didn't work so it was always boiling hot even in October. But I can forgive most things even the less than helpful attitude of the staff. I can't forgive the cockroaches scuttling across the foyer only a matter of feet from the cafe. DISGUSTING. Is it a good deal for the money? Probably. But I've stayed at other Travelodges in London - do yourselves a favour and pick one of the others.,nikki2005
UR6334971,2006-5-December,Stayed here on 4th December 2006 paid the standard tariff of 70 per night. As with the other two Travelodges in the Kings Cross area the noise from the traffic is intrusive but at least you can't hear the trains at this one. Kings Cross isn't the nicest of areas but there are enough ordinary people around to prevent one feeling uncomfortable. Staff were polite on check in. The room was clean enough even though the wallpaper was peeling in places. The problem I had was with the hot water. The electric shower didn't work (I assume it was electric) and the hot water pressure was not strong enough to power the mains water shower. I took a bath after waiting around 20 minutes for the bath to fill a couple of inches. The problem with the water pressure happened both in the night and the morning. The hotel appears to be a partially refurbished old hotel so I couldn't be bothered to complain. I wouldn't stay here again even with the cheaper deals you can usually get if you book at the right time.,Dimeander
UR4824870,2006-31-March,Being a contruction worker and work away from home most of the year i have stopped in a lot of budget hotels in my time. This hotel is the most untidy grubby hotel i have ever stopped in. You could imagine my wife's face when she opened the door to our room after telling her for weeks that i would never take her and the kids (3 and 2yrs) to a dump as she had her doubts as it was only 26 per night. The beds where clean and that was the last of the good points on the room. There was mould in the bathroom on the windows the ceiling. We had a electric fan heater for heating there was holes in walls where pictures should of been and The wallpaper was falling off above the windows. i think i will leave my photos to do the talking as iam getting very mad just thinking about this place. i hope my photos put a picture to simalar reveiws to mine. p.s where the people staying here who gave raving reveiws of this hotel staying there in the 60's as i guess this was the last time it was modernised,tom375
UR5765873,2006-3-September,I worked for a language school and they use this hotel for their students hence as the students' chaperone I was to stay there too. I've seen many rooms in this hotel - both my own and student's. Rooms are both good - it used to be a 4* hotel at least 30 years ago and there are signs of this - and bad - again because it was 4* at least 30 years ago some rooms - especially on the 5th floor is severely in need of gutting out to remove the mould patches flaky paint ceiling cracks and dirt... Some beds are comfy some you would think would be more suited to being hammock rather than bed by definition. My room in the last night anyone can possibly make me stay in that hotel was infested with bed bugs. The staff made an error with the rooms and my single room was finally found after a long "look around" for it. I woke up the next day face and ears all over my body to my toes covered in bed bug bites (confirmed by pharmacist doctor and apologetic travelodge staff). Travelodge staff told me I'd been given a room which was not meant to be used due to the infestion and it was a terrible mistake. I was told they minimise disturbance - i.e. cut costs - by only employing pest control every 3 months. They refunded 60 GBP and 7 GBP for antihistamines and I'm still waiting for a call 6 weeks later from the manager to apologise for their mistake having given the duty manager all my contact details and was promised a call and was told that they're very common in the UK and she had heard of a lot of cases since she had come to England working in Travelodge. Having done some reading on bed bugs they actually migrate to surrounding rooms if they do not feed after a few months so I would suggest that maybe the frequent number of cases is simply that the bed bugs are migrating to other rooms since the rooms are only treated every 3 months. For me apart from being unsightly the itching was unbearable and that evening some of them turned into blisters - though the bites were already pretty horrendous as each bite was a red area around 3cm squared and swollen hard and white in the centre. I went to a doctor and was given stronger antihistamines and steroid cream and no more turned into blisters. They finally calmed down after around 7 days during which I was too itchy and sleep deprived to work (the psychotic effects of literally being eaten alive are severe). 6 weeks later the red patches where the bugs bit are still there and people have asked if it is ecsema - and it's not from itching - I avoided the massive urge to itch and even the bites that I could not reach to itch if i had itched look the same. To summarise I would avoid this hotel at all costs the staff were not very helpful or cooperative - when they messed up the booking tried to accuse the company of not booking enough rooms. they lost 30 packed lunches between 6 and 7am which turned up that afternoon - because the reception staff on the morning shift did not speak english. Many of the rooms are shoddy the service in the restaurant is abysmal (2 hours for quiet lunchtime for a party of 15)... Get a good room at a good rate and you're very lucky with a proper bargain get a terrible room and end up scarred from bites or get a poor room and get a hammock with mould patches...,d40dum
UR5831408,2006-24-September,This hotel was so bad we could not stay and left after 30 minutes! My girlfriend and I were given a room on the 6th floor and it was absolutely disgusting! The bathroom was smelly carpets filthy bed cover carpet wallpaper and curtains torn. We were then moved to a refurbished room on the 1st floor however the room was stifling and the window did not open. There was airconditioning but it made such a loud buzzing noise that it would be impossible to sleep. Stay away - even for 26 per night it is not worth it!,joel_30
UR5702069,2006-23-August,This had to be the worst hotel experience I've ever had. We were booked in for one night and the first room we were given had a distinctly dilapidated feel with paint flaking off the walls and cigarette burns in the carpet and curtains. And it was small...very small. So we trooped back down to reception and got them to move us which they did to a room which was the same size but slightly better appointed. Unfortunately we couldn't open the window properly and in the middle of a summer heatwave with no air-con it was like an oven. So we left the door open and hoped that the air-flow would gradually cool the place down. It didn't. At around 3:00am I'd had enough and left my wife and daughter in the room deciding I'd be better off sleeping in the car! Our visit also coincided with a crowd of Italian kids staying there who were not only noisy but monopolised the one and only set of lifts from the reception to the various floors of the hotel. There was no staircase as an alternative so if you wanted to leave your floor at the wrong time you spent 10 minutes waiting for a lift that wasn't packed to the gunnels with chattering teenagers. We skipped breakfast and fled.,mountkeen
UR4695034,2006-20-March,With rats as your neighbour - NEVER AGAIN!!! Travelodge offers very attractive rates for hotels in central london from as little as 26 if you book on line early in advance. But you will have to pay for it somewhere. I stayed for 2 nights in January 2006 (not consecutively). The first night was ok although the room was old - given the price I paid I couldn't complain more. But there was definitely an attitude probelm among the staff and most of them didn't give a damn about anything. While i was checking in there was another couple panicking in the lobby as water was leaking in their bathroom - it was more like flooding to be precise. However the staff "in-charge" was on the phone and so in the 10 minutes + that I took to check-in nobody did anything and the water continued to flood. I got the impression that "changing rooms" was very common in that hotel and the staff were very used to it. They believe that as long as the room is changed it will be fine - there's nothing to panic or to apologise about. I can confirm this when i stayed for the second night. I chose the same room as it was a quiet room. At about 1am I saw a shadow in my room and then I realised it was a RAT!!!!!!!! It escaped to a hole in between the wall and the floor!!!!!! It was absolutely disguisting!!! I phoned up the reception to report this and requested to change room (bear in mind you cannot phone up the reception from the telephone in your room e.g press 0.... you can only call from you mobile if you have their reception number in advance). It was after 1am and in my pajamas and I was told to collect another key from the reception. No apologies whatsoever... I told the guy that I was in my pajamas and given I had to check out the new room it would be better for him to bring up the key and show me that room first before I decided to accept it. I had to persuade him to do this. When this staff turned up all he was interested in was whether it was a rat or a mouse. He didn't apologise. In addition to that the old-aged radiator/ air cooler (at least 20 years old) doesn't work. The rat room had a new moveable radiator (something i use at home) but the other room which i moved to later hasn't got one- so after moving from the rat room I was very cold for the rest of the night. I have stayed in various Travelodge for 4 times in between Oct 05 to Jan 06. Once I was offered some uncooked food (uncooked sausages) in Worcester Travelodge as the staff was in a rush so that he can watch the X-Factor final; woken up by cleaning staff before 9am in Covent Garden Travelodge although there was a sign outside my door clearly said "Do not Disturb". I thought those are minor but with the rat in Islington Travelodge this left me with no option but to put this on-line to let everyone know. Do you know why for most Travelodges in their offical web site only the external pictures are shown? (i.e. no bedroom pictures?) It is because the condition is appauling. I am not saying it is not clean but they are like hotels that have not had any refurbishment for over 20 years. You would be lucky if you have a new radiator in your room as all the old ones do not work. I chose to stay in Travelodge for the obvious reason because it was cheap to purchase on-line in advance. But after 4 stays and with 3 ridiculous experiences there is no way I would stay another night with Travelodge again. One final note is that I phoned up Travelodge head office trying to find out which Travelodge in London was new (i.e. at least refurbished over the last 2-3 years) so that there's less likely to get a hole in the wall... I was told that Islington was new!!!!!! Can you believe that!!!! Yes the reception and the canteen are but certainly not any of the rooms/ corridor.... Never again,terri123
UR6448777,2006-16-December,Because the front entrance was blocked off for decoration we had to go in by the side. This was scary. As the previous reviewer said there were lots of tramps hanging around the property shouting and drinking. This went on all night long. I saw the police there several times when I looked out my window but still these characters remained on the hotel gounds. The staff didn't seem to care.,Emerentia
UR6445080,2006-15-December,Do not stay at this hotel! Where will I begin? No front entrance as covered with scaffolding so we had to come & go by a side entrance. Very noisy in the rooms looking into this kind of car park area. A very dodgy area and lots of unsavoury characters hanging around making a noise and drinking. We complained to the hotel staff but they took no action. I would never stay in this place again and would advise anyone else against it.,wozzi
UR5731942,2006-1-September,Stayed in the hotel over the bank holiday weekend with my partner. When we eventually arrived (hotel was quite a way from the train station) the three couples in front of us at check in were all sent away to other travelodges in the area due to their bookings being messed up. Not a good sign! When we got served the gentleman serving us told us there were no doubles left as we had booked (three months previously) so I guess our double had been given out to a higher paying customer. We got given a card for a twin room on the 5th Floor only to find there were a couple already 'occupying' our room! After marching back down to reception we were given half of our money back and given a family room instead. The room was fine carpet very dirty so take slippers and the bathroom was TINY but overall fine for a quick stay. During the night the fire alarms went off twice once at midnight and once at 5:45am so not a great first nights sleep but the following nights were uninterupted. Area wasn't as bad as I was told so if you are looking for a cheap night in London this place will do just be prepared to walk to all the main attractions!,kayleighj
UR5289856,2006-1-June,This trip was for myself and a group of friends for our birthday. However it was not a good hotel at all. The windows are restricted air conditioning does not operate bathrooms are really small and no ventilation in the bathrooms. Overall we did not spend the night in the Travelodge. Please think twice it you wish to stay at the Travelodge Kings Cross Royal Scot.,leena1
