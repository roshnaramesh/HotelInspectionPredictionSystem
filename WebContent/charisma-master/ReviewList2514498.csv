UR125846228,2012-9-March,After reading the scathing reviews from our fellows on Tripadvisor I called to cancel my reservation for late February. Again worried about all the issues regarding this hotel I actually wrote down the cancellation confirmation number and name of the reservation agent. Of course on my next AMEX statement is the room charge from the hotel. When I called the accounting department at the hotel to give them my cancellation confirmation number I was told I had to write an email explaining "my error" and why they should refund the charge. I requested and received the hotel manager who basically told me there was nothing she could do. I told her I would be contacting AMEX to resolve the issue and instead take my time providing my scathing review of her hotel WHERE I DID NOT EVEN STAY! I am personally amazed based on the negative reviews at this hotel that it even stays in business.,Luv2SkiTahoe

UR122735433,2012-7-January,Let's get the location thing out of the way: This hotel is an an awesome awesome location: across the street from Madison Square Garden right near 1/2/3 subway line. Stores restaurants Midtown attractions - you're in the center of it all. Don't stay there. This hotel is more than 90 years old and it shows. It's not a charming historical hotel but a huge and badly maintained dump. The room I've stayed at had stains on the walls and the carpet was weird the TV was an old CRT and some of the wiring was carelessly done. Lighting was inadequate room was almost always dark. The bed seemed old as well not very comfortable. The window which overlooked one of the folds of the hotel and not the street was thin enough to allow a lot of noise in which is a problem in the city that never sleeps. The bathtub had a huge ugly stain around the drainage hole and the shower head was uncomfortable. That said I wouldn't call Pennsylvania hotel unsanitary - no bed bugs the bed sheets were clean and so were the towels. Another lackluster aspect was the customer service. Due to unforeseen circumstances my girlfriend needed to book the hotel for me and she has done so with her credit card since I didn't have mine on me. When I checked into a hotel in DC with the same situation they were friendly and just asked me for a 100$ security deposit which I was happy to provide. At Penn they refused to do that claiming it's the hotel policy and they're not to blame it wasn't made clear when I ordered on third party website. The supervisor even had the audacity to answer the question "Where does it say that I have to have a credit card" with a vaguely threatening "You don't wanna go down that road with me". In the end I was only allowed to check in after my girlfriend photographed her cc and drivers license and sent it to them by email (How very secure). I understand that this hotel is usually one of the cheapest in Manhattan but seriously it doesn't worth the 20-40$ a night you'll save if you're a tourist. If you just need a place to stay at cheaply near MSG well it beats staying on the street.,DenisVitchevsky
UR124253151,2012-7-February,Dirty and unkempt. Dust everywhere air con broken (front falling off) and cracked toilet seat. Decieving from the outside and reception. But central and easy access to everywhere either on foot or subway. Would we go back to that hotel - No.,TheHortonsWarrington
UR127425968,2012-7-April,I stayed at the Penn in July 2012 and I had an awful stay. I was happy when my stay ended. The room was filty the shower didn't work properly and it was smelly all over. There was very rude staff at the front desk. Myself working as a hotel manager was treated in a very bad way. The queue upon check-out time was huge and I was waiting to do my check-out for approx 1 hour. When it was my turn three young guests went to the desk and I asked them to go an queue as well as everybody did. The receptionist was shouting at me and insaulting me. She told me that it is her who is deciding who will be next at the dest and who has to wait. There was one manager I suppose it was the GM of the hotel watching all the people queueing and was just standing there. One guest asked him for an information and he sent the guest to queue as well. What a horrible service from the top to the bottom... I will never ever stay there again,nahla1976
UR125715956,2012-6-March,I never go to the trouble of giving bad reviews to hotels restaurants bars etc. However in the case of Hotel Pennsylvania I'm more than willing to make an exception. This place was/is an absolute dump. I understand the appeal of an historic hotel in NYC but I have no tolerance for old ratty linens dirty bathrooms non-working lights missing amenities (i.e. ironing board) and just a general lack of being with the times. The room was $120 for one night which by NYC standards is cheap. Holiday Inn Express was the exact same price and I wish I had gone with them instead of Hotel Pennsylvania. I'm not what anyone would call a frequent traveler so any hotel losing my business is far from an issue for them. However I hope I can influence anyone else that is even considering this place. If you enjoy staying at any hotel with modern amenities and acceptable upkeep/cleanliness DO NOT stay at the Hotel Pennsylvania. Consider yourselves forewarned :),Patrick M
UR124211996,2012-6-February,The lobby of this hotel is beautiful. But you will soon realize that is where the beauty ends. The whole building hasn't been renovated since who knows when. The walls are paper thin. The bathrooms are old tiny and drafty. The carpet looks like it was laid in the 60's. It's peeling back everywhere. The walls are scuffed old and dirty. The location of this hotel is great. It's right across from Madison Square Garden and just a few blocks from Times Square and everything Midtown has to offer. If you are a young person coming into the city for a concert and just need a place to crash this will do the trick. But if you are looking for a comfortable clean hotel where you can stay for a vacation this is NOT it.,lbourg1
UR125583672,2012-4-March,I stayed at this hotel 2 years ago and have never got over it. Having visited NY last month staying in the superb Hotel Park South I felt compelled to write a review. This hotel is atrocious the staff are rude aggressive and totally disorganised. The rooms were disgusting upon arrival we were faced with dirty unmade beds filthy carpets wet used towels heaped on the floor and as for the bathroom dont go there urghh! How they get away with it I dont know the management should be ashamed of themselves. Oh I nearly forgot to add that the Westminster Dog Show being held in Madison Square Gdns hence the hotel was full of dogs and their owners which resulted in dog wee and poo in the reception area corridors and lifts honestly I'm not exaggerating. Do not stay here ever!,Cathy F
UR127250234,2012-4-April,We took a school trip here from the UK Students out in rooms across all floor not together not enough beds some rooms hadn't been cleaned from previous guests.Dogs all over the hotel. Rooms smelt showers disgusting. Tramps and druggies hanging around in and outside of the lobby. Staff slow rude unhelpful and did not resolve issues in fact at one stage one of the "managers" was hiding from us in the back. Some staff I would even describe as agressive. Location didn't make up for the awful hotel and staff. Stay somewhere else.,Lindsay E
UR126948643,2012-30-March,From the beginning Hotel Pennsylvania disqualified itself by (in the rudest possible way) demanding 4 dollars per suitcase for holding them for one hour. (The room wasn't ready so we had to pay extra.) That is more or less the quality of service for this hotel. Rude staff who is absolutely unwilling to help let alone send you a smile seems to be company culture. We don't expect that to change sorry. (And we are positive people who always meet people with a smile. Only one receptionist returned that gesture and did what he could for us. As you will know from other reviews the hotel is quite run down. Rooms are dark brown with insufficient lighting and not in any way renewed for decades. Off course there was neither fan nor air condition in the room. The socalled business lounge contains of two coffee machines two computers of old age and generally old fashioned cafe furniture. The carpet was totally worn down. The two computers was at all times occupied by kids and young people who used them for Facebook for hours. The hotel doesn't seem to care for the travellers using mobile devices as smart phones or iPads. The only way to get your own device online was by cable in the room at USD 11 plus taxes. And we even paid extra for free wifi and a superior room! This had been confirmed twice to our travel agent thus making us choose HP because of the location. Breakfast is served in the socalled business lounge and consists of rolls croissants jam and coffee plus a watery orange cordial. No yogurt no fruit no juice no milk no cheese no meat - nothing but rolls jam thin cordial and coffee. We even got a "special deal" paying 208 per night for a double. Or ... no ... perhaps we didn't. Because when we arrived we were told that the rate differed from day to day ending at 262 dollars per night. Plus taxes of course. And this was late March 2012 implying low season. Wonder how much they're gonna charge you in July? NEVER get anywhere near Hotel Pennsylvania.,SteenKR
UR127165056,2012-3-April,If you don't have allergies you might stand the stale air the tiles & caulking in the bath are cracking and loose There is mold stains all over the tub area including the ceiling. Make certain that you have flip flops to walk around the room as the rugs are very old and you'll probably get a fungal infection from the rug &/or tub area. It's noisy because the walls are so thin you can hear every word others say & I have moderate hearing loss. In addition the street is busy so you get the traffic noise too.,Sheryl C
UR123780688,2012-29-January,We arrived on a pre-paid deal and waited 15 mins at check in to find they had no room for us due to a convention that weekend. After about 5 mins they gave us room 1778. Having trudged down long corridors we were faced with a door with paint flaking off. Inside the room was a decent size but obviously had not been used for a while. Someone had raced up to open a window. Luckily the weather was unseasonably mild for January so we could unplug the heater that would have kept the whole of Manhattan awake all night! Paint was flaking off the walls and ceiling in the bathroom the toilet seat was stained and the toilet got blocked on day 2 and was not dealt with by the cleaners during the day so we had to delay our departure to the theatre to wait to get it fixed. We could have complained and others on our deal did but they lost a whole day of their holiday changing to various other rooms. Staff were not good by UK standards let alone US. It was just good luck that the weather was so good that all we needed was a reasonably clean bed. We have been to worse hotels just can't remember when!!!,Peter W
UR126738330,2012-27-March,I recently attended a conference that took place in the Hotel Pennsylvania. I got a great price ($119) considering the location and figured if the conference was happening there it would be fine. WRONG. The room was really horrible. The rug and bedspread looked as if they hadn't been updated in 25 years and maybe not even washed or shampooed in all that time. The bathroom was ugly but not too scary because the smell of bleach was so strong I knew nothing too bad could survive there. (I got a headache from the fumes though.) The walls were dirty and the room so dark it would have been depressing even if it had been clean. I checked the sheets for bedbugs and they were clean but I was still worried. In the end I survived the two nights without getting bedbugs or any other disease I know of and the location really is fantastic. If you must stay here bring slippers because you won't want your feet touching the floor don't spend any more time in your room than you have to and keep your expectations low. If you pay very little you will get what you pay for!!!!,NancySantaCruz_CA
UR123622098,2012-25-January,DO NOT SYAY HERE - Ever We paid through our Travel agent $430 per night for 3 people. The rooms are disgusting. Please look at the photos.,michele8040
UR126582851,2012-24-March,By far the worst hotel I ever ALMOST stayed in. We checked in in a fairly nice lobby and then proceeded to go to the room. All the doors looked worn and had paint falling off. First clue. There were people pounding on doors Second clue. There was the smell. Third clue. Then the cu-de-grace the room!!!! Where to start? The carpet that hadn't been cleaned maybe ever? The bed that sagged worse than a 20 year old horse? The feeling that bugs were climbing up your back as you stood there? Or the creepy door that led off to some unknown room with an adjoining door without a lock? Safe to say we got out of there pronto. The girl at the front desk was very non chellant about canceling the booking. Like she knew it would happen or has happened many times before. If I could rate this -1 I would.,churdles
UR126489404,2012-22-March,This scam of a hotel took $240 off my credit card without telling me they were going to do it. When I noticed that the money was missing and called they said it was in case I watched any movies. First they told me I would get my moneyback after 5 to 10 days then they said 7 to 10 days. Apparently the desk clerk was supposed to inform me they were taking the money. He did not! The rooms are dingy my sheets were filthy and looked like they hadn't been washed the bed was hard as a board. I will never ever stay here again.,wsheldon518
UR125030497,2012-22-February,When booking a group trip to the hotel Penn I was not put off by the bad reviews on this site as I knew students not want to be 'told off' for being noisy or up late.However there were far more worrying things happening than just nasty rooms. We were met by the Bell Captain on arribal who had all our keys ready which was very appreciated. On inspection of the rooms however we had been allocated 18 twin rooms and 4 single rooms but booked 9 tripples 9 twins and 4 singles. We needed accommodation for 9 extra people! I returned to the reception spoke to the manager to sort this out. She informed me that they were going to put cots in 9 of the twin rooms. This was just not acceptable as once this started to happen it was very evident the rooms were simply not big enough to fit extra beds in and still have floor space. One room looked as it it had one massive bed covering the whole floor. I returned to reception and told them this was not going to work and asked them to find us 9 tripple rooms. The hotel issued us with new rooms for 3 of those allocated on another floor but after inspection they were the same rooms but on a different floor. I returned the keys and asked them to try again. The hotel finally managed to find 2 tripple rooms but had to squeeze the extras into the rooms we had. We still needed to find rooms for 4 students so asked the hotel if they could give us an extra two tripple rooms. They refused and said that beds were being sent up to the rooms we had. One of our lecturers had enough of this situation and gave his own room up for 2 of those students and went to find another hotel to check into. We then convinced the final 2 students to bed share with their friends in the rooms they had as it was just pointless to try and find any other solution to our problem as it was now very late in the evening and students wanted to go to bed. In a nutshell we asked for and paid for 9 tripple rooms we eventually had 2 and the rest had to sleep in a cot or bed share. One member of staff stayed in another hotel. We did not engage with anyone from the hotel after the first evening as it was an absolute waste of our time doing so.,jasonbevan
UR126425940,2012-21-March,I just recently returned from staying at the Hotel Pennsylvania New York. I was concerned about staying here after reading some of the reviews but we met a nice gentleman on the plane who asked where we were staying and when I told him he said "that is a very nice hotel" I asked if he was sure because some of the reviews were a little sketchy. He commented that I shouldn't read reviews. When we arrived I was pleasantly surprised as the lobby area was nice and grand. That wore off pretty quick after it took 45 minutes to check in. Upon checking in we were told that even though we had reserved a King size room there were none available and would be given a double instead. I asked if there would be a price reduction and was told that since I had prepaid there was nothing that could be done about the price. It was late and I was tired so I just let it go. The clerk then said that we could look into changing to a king size room the next day. As we proceeded to get to our room I saw what others had mentioned in their reviews. The hotel has not been updated and the carpet and walls were dingy. As we opened the room I was disappointed. The walls had paint peeling and the bathroom had not been serviced. I called the front desk to mention about the bathroom and the person on the other end of the line seemed bothered. After 1 hour maintance finally took care of one problem. When I requested housekeeping I felt that I was a bother but was told they would be right over. Needless to say they never appeared that night. I was so distrubed that I slept in my clothes. The next day housekeeping did come but my request to change to a king room was once again denied. It was finally on my third night my request to change to a king room (the one I had reserved) was granted. I will say that the king room was in much better shape than the double room we had been staying in. The walls are very thin and you can hear everything. Now the positive thing about the hotel is it's location. It is located in Midtown Manhattan and is right next to the subway. There were always people and police officers around so I always felt safe. Would I stay there again? Probably not.,maddiescoots
UR124979216,2012-21-February,We came home with horrible bed bug bites. The heater didn't work beacuse the outlet didn't work. The bathroom was filthy. The only good thing was the facility for the dogs during Westminister.,KathyL909
UR123374624,2012-20-January,I booked 4 rooms in mid December for 5 days. It was not cheap total was 633 per room. Our rooms were all differant 2 were big (one massive) and 2 very small. All 4 rooms had damp patches on walls and ceilings very bad electrics and stains on carpets and beds. My room had a large stain which smelt of vomit. The windows were very dirty and mine woldnt shut. Not good in December. I had asked for all of our rooms to be next to each other ( had booked tis in August) however although all on 7th floor we were spread all over it. The corridors were dirty peeling paint and damp. No wifi in he rooms also electric sockets right above the sink a small splash of water would have gone in it. Whilst downstairs outside on side entrance for a smoke I was offered sex and drugs by men and women. When I complained to the reception they said dont smoke! I pointed out that rentboys were in the lobby and they said "we get all sorts in here". It was only when I threatened to call the police that someone went over and asked them to leave. They were there the next day. Man at lifts is supposed to check only guests going up in lifts he never once asked to see our card keys. Our floor had several people wandering around at night who were clearly not guests and twice someone tried the handle to my room. This place is a rip off and filthy. Needs shutting down and refurbished from top to bottom. Staff were not rude just ground down. All I heard was people complaining about the state of the place and the lack of security. Someone was robbed in a corridor whilst we were there. There are also homeless people sleeping in the lobby.,Ben G
UR122410974,2012-2-January,There are a lot of hotels in New York so ranking it as the worst would be difficult to do. But I'm sure it would be among the leading candidates. I often travel to NY on business. Based on price and location one of our secretaries booked this hotel for our trip. The rate was low for Manhattan and it was located across the street from our client. So for cost and convenience it was a good choice. But it's not a good choice if: - You don't want to stand in line nearly an hour to check in - You don't want to stand in line nearly an hour to check out - You don't want to stay in soiled room - You don't want a permantly stuck open window during a frigid night - You don't to shower in a pitch black bathroom - You don't want to shave by using the light of your cellphone This hotel has become the butt of several jokes in our office since our trip. We feel like survivors.,TTGA
UR126328696,2012-19-March,I stayed here for a conference. The conference facilities were fine but the hotel rooms were dank and dingy. Broken tiles in bathroom. Not enough blankets. No wake-up service. I met others at the conference that stayed a few blocks away and walked over. I would do the same next time.,PamandSam
UR123292722,2012-19-January,Very expensive but not very clean and staff are very rude to their customers. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. by: Linda Evans Photos: 24,09Evans2009
UR124819337,2012-19-February,Worst hotel I have ever been to! We checked in Knowing this place was not the Hilton but we thought at least the room would be clean. The staff at the front desk were very rude and nasty with us from check in. We then went to our room and noticed that the lock was broken on our door. We called the front desk to ask if we could move to another room but were told that none were available. The manager advised us that they would repair it in the morning. A little later that evening we decided to go to bed I noticed a pubic hair on the sheets. I then moved all of the covers and found a pair of woman's black panties in the bed! The panties put us over the top. We went to the front desk and demanded a refund. Only after they saw the picture on our phone of the panties would they check us out without penalty! Never stay here. It is a filthy hotel. I think the homeless shelter would be better than this dump! I don't think this place deserves 1 star but a 0 is not an option!,Cook4815
UR123253296,2012-18-January,We booked the hotel through their website before traveling to NYC. We were using a card with my name on it but for other reasons I would not be have the card with me when traveling. I called when making the booking to find out if this was okay. If it wasn't I would have booked using a different card. I was told by a young man over the phone that this would not be a problem. When I arrived after waiting in a long time in line I made it to the counter. I was asked for a card and when I said I told the woman at the counter what happend I was called a liar before I even got out what I was trying to say. She refused to even listen. I asked for a manager who I assumed would be upset with the attitude of her employee. After another long wait the manager came over and loudly began arguing before I could even speak. I just put the room on another card and moved on. The hotel was dirty and smelled but I didn't expect much because of the price. My main concern was due to the complete lack of civility from the staff. I hope this issue is addressed immediately this was the worst customer service experience I have ever had.,sean B

UR126220132,2012-17-March,I take a group of students to NYC every year for a conference and we stay at the Hotel Pennsylvania every time. Why? Because our school will only let us stay at the place with the lowest bid and Hotel Penn always has the lowest bid. It is doable. There were no bed bugs on any occasion but the rooms are old and in need of repairs. Our room this year smelled terribly of smoke the AC and fan were broken the bathroom door didn't close and there was jackhammering outside our window from midnight until 2AM every morning. The sheets were clean and the towels looked clean but didn't smell super fresh. If I had a choice to go somewhere else I would but given the situation the Hotel Penn isn't so bad that I won't go back again next year.,Beachkat9
UR123196089,2012-17-January,On the key cards for the rooms The Hotel Pennsylvania which sits on Seventh Avenue and opposite the Penn Station proclaims itself as "The World's Most Popular Hotel" (their capitals). This description wantonly flies in the face of the British Trades Descriptions Act. It is certainly busy a place where visitors will flock because it is in the bargain bucket range of establishments. That does not mean that the place has to be scruffy - which it is - dirty (it is the only hotel in which I have stayed in nearly fifty years of travel where there have been piles of litter in the corridors) and generally unloved and unkepmt. Built in the 1920's and fabled in the hit song by Glenn Miller (Pensylvannia 6-5000 is the hotel's telephone number) it has seen far far better times. As Miss Bette Davis once neatly observed "what A DUMP!" The vast lobby is unwelcoming and austere - as was the woman on the front desk (you wait in a long queue and no apologies are offered or smiles given) who was clearly trying out for the title of Ice Queen of 2012. The corridor on the 15th floor was bestrewn with discarded pizza boxes and beverage holders and a few used tissues. The walls are grubby and smeared with paint marks (is someone actually going to do some decorating?) and my room had chipped and ancient furniture and a bathroom in which you could with some difficulty swing a mouse. The bed linen was clean however and there was a view of the Empire State Building from the window one of the few good things to say about this truly ghastly experience. Returning from a dinner with frinds a homeless man had installed himself on a bench in the lobby and was snoozing with his drink propped between his knees. We only spent one nIght in this sad shadow of a hotel - if someone was able to spend a good few million on it close it down to refurbish from top to bottom and then re-open it after a through restoration project the Penn might just might be worth a visit. As it is it is a clasic monument on how not to run a hotel. What makes one shivver is that the Penn is a historic building a riot of art deco style - but clearly no-one in charge loves it or respects it. It is one step up from a doss house.... and if you want to see what a few dollars will do walk around the block to Eighth Avenue and discover the re-modelled New Yorker which is everything that a tourist's hotel should be - kindly and attentive staff a great little cocktail bar off the lobby clean and modern rooms efficient service. WHAT a difference - the New Yorker was also a child of the 1920's but this has been embraced and cleverly enhanced. Every detail is spot on. And I know which place I'll be going back to!,yorkieman8
UR123150428,2012-16-January,do not stay in this dump it looks nice as u walk in it took an hour n half 2 check in then we was givin a key 2 r room only 2 find someboby else was stayin in it when i went 2 reception i was told i wouldnt get an up grade agen. the room was disgustin and dirty the bath was dirty wot u had 2 stand in 2 have a shower which was broke.the only good thing was the coffee shop thank god new york was so amazin otherwise it would of spoit r trip.,linzi698
UR124689296,2012-16-February,The lobby is deceptive and makes you think the hotel might be okay but it's NOT. Checked into a room that had a used chapstick container and m&m's on the floor. The water was brown when we turned on the shower and would not drain. The paint was peeling off the walls in the room and in the hallways. All the hallways and elevators were filthy and looked like they hadn't seen a vacuum in years. Called the front desk and they were extremely rude interrupted me on the phone and said they 'would send up a bellman to move our room.' No one ever came. After an hour we called the front desk again and got hung up on. FInally we went down to the lobby and the front desk clerk gave us a new room. This room was equally as dingy. The water this time would alternate between scalding and frigid no matter what you sent the temperature at. You couldn't even shower. And to make things worse they tried to charge us twice as much for this room because it was 'PEN 5000.' So if you want a dingy double bed unregulated water temperatures and garbage and front desk staff that yell at you book here. It was so bad we had to find another hotel for the next night. Save yourself don't book here!,Alison C
UR124625772,2012-15-February,This hotel has one thing going for it it is across from Madison Square Garden. Not sure where to start with the negatives... I guess check-in: Huge line which is understandable since we were there for the dog show. But once we finally reached the counter our room was not available we'd need to wait in the line again to check in... want to leave your luggage with them? $4 a bag!!!! Oy! Once we finally got our room it was tiny and really gross: Dirty carpets Dust basically everywhere if you open the historic valet doors you will find enough dust to clog any vacuum cleaner. Furniture was basically falling apart Heat either pumped out too much hot air or was freezing with basically no way to control the temp. Outlets were incredibly loose and often your electronics just fell out of them. Terrible pillows with no extras available. The walls were paper thin. Ice machine was not working on our floor. Ok on to the bathroom: Yuck!!!! Mold everywhere! Peeling paint and huge holes in the walls Huge stains on the marble shower was at about chin level and was so forceful it actually hurt to use it The wind from the forceful shower pulled the curtain in to the shower area so it stuck to you while bathing. This also lead to a huge amount of water on the floor of the bathroom. The temp was impossible to control and often would scald you. The tub stopper was not connected to the chain so impossible to empty the tub. We figured that housekeeping would help with this issue but nope returned to find a tub filled with the same water... Had to jam a hanger in there to unstop! Basically it was nice to be able to walk to the dog show and hang with pups in the lobby. Everything else was awful!,ktmBoston
UR124446806,2012-11-February,I stayed at this hotel for 2 days and was in 3 different rooms the last day of my stay a room attendent was cleaning and dropped my $368.00 ceramic irons the hotel was willing (haha) to pay $50.00 because they seen it on a ebay website for that price. the staff is so rude and they babrely speak english! If your looking to break your bank and be disrespected and violated then this will be the place for you! but like i said CAUTION! THE MAIDS DONT EVEN KNOCK BEFORE ENTERING YOUR ROOM!,Naiymah S
UR122865928,2012-10-January,terrible terrible terrible . if you ever want to see a hotel that simply survives on location this is it . i stayed in this property for so many years i dont even know why ????? the bed sheets smell of guests that have stayed here in the past . the rooms were dirty the bathrooms broken the sofas in the suites had no cushions yuck !!!! the service and staff was disgusting and rude like crazy !!!!!! never again would i want to go back here !!!! never ever !!!!!,SAIMOHAN
UR122382200,2012-1-January,Covered in bites after one night in this hotel. Check-in process was insane I have never waited so long to check in in my life. Sure the location is great for tourist stuff but I wouldn't stay here again. Save some extra pennies and find somewhere else.,Chris_hlf
UR127086307,2012-1-April,This is the worse hotel I've ever been to. It was so bad - that myself and coworkers ended up leaving (paying for our rooms) and checking into the Hampton Inn down the street. It is not sanitary and very creepy. I wasn't concerned about bed bugs but what else could I get from this room. Go down the street to the Hampton Inn and you will be much happier!!,Cakie123
UR117862955,2011-9-September,What can I say? I read the reviews and had my doubts but it was only for 2 nights so I thought I'd take the risk. But I would NEVER go there again! It's okay if you just need a bed to sleep but don't expect anything more. Huge room with tiny bathroom paint chipped everywhere everything outdated. Halls feel more like prison. No wifi internet in the lobby (pay). Waiting line for check-in. My pillow smelled bad... I never even bothered to take pictures. No we enjoyed our 5-day stay at Comfort Inn Theatre District (with only 2 stars) so much more!!!,Kristine0210
UR119111616,2011-9-October,Having stayed here once before in 2006 I was hoping there would have been an improvement in the standard of the rooms but sadly this was not to be. Its a huge hotel (around 1700 rooms) which is very well situated on 7th Avenue handy for Penn Station Macys Empire State Building and many more sights but the grand lobby at odds with state of rooms. Our room this time was clean enough with an adequate bed but had bad natural light and no bedside lighting. Electrics were insecure and with wiring partially exposed; luckily we were an adult couple with no inquisitive kids! A huge TV cabinet dominated the room but there was little closet space for clothes. Its far from being the best value for money in NYC with no complimentary breakfast Wi-Fi or in-room coffee maker. The staff were generally helpful but you sense the owners of the hotel are not interested in anything but making as much money as possible and relying on the largely young clientele to put up with the basic accommodation on offer. I wont be going back a third time.,BeverleyBlue
UR107568144,2011-9-May,I stayed in Hotel Penn for a night and i was glad that it was only a night. The hotel had an impressive lobby and it was just opposite the Penn Station and Madison Square Garden which makes the location ideal. However the rooms are really in need for renovation. The bed feels rough and it is not comfortable to sleep in. The television is not working properly and images are blurred all the time. For the price that i paid for my night stay (USD180) i would strongly recommend to look for another hotel and pay a higher price as Hotel Penn is really not worth wasting your money on.,Bunhun
UR99595027,2011-9-March,This was our second time staying at New Yorks Pennsylvania Hotel 2 years apart each time for one night and nothing has changed. The hotel was built in 1919 and it was surely a fine hotel at its height in its youth. It is a beautiful building from the outside and the lobby is spacious. The elevator doors remind us of the 1920s. But that is where the beauty stops. At the check-in counter we were greeted by an extremely rude Indian clerk. He asked if we were checking out and I told him we were checking in. He replied that check in started at 3pmand even when I told him wed requested early check in he repeated that check in was at 3pm and they had no rooms available before then. He refused to see if he could respect our early check in request. So  after10 minutes he went took his break and my partner spoke to another clerk to see if we could get a room. We did and we checked in at about noon. Once off the elevator you step into the waiting area for the elevators which leads to a dark and gloomy corridor that runs the length of the building from end to end. Along the corridor there are guest rooms and there are several alcoves that lead to other guest rooms. Youll have to read the signs above the entranceways to find your room. These corridors have wall-to-wall carpeting which is some shade of brown (I think) along the edge and some kind of floral design in the centre. If its dirty youll never notice it because the carpet is dark and so is the corridor. We stayed in Room 1182 which was designated as a Penn 5000 room whatever that means because I have no idea what benefits it grants. It was a small room a little bigger than the average interior cruise-ship cabin with too much furniture: an empty mini refrigerator a large 3-drawer dresser a large desk (which was very unstable) with a chair and a bed. The bed was said to be a double bed and it was small and thoroughly uncomfortable. On the ceiling above the table and not far from the bed there was a black spot which I think was mould in a water mark. At certain places on the walls and doors either the paint was peeling off or there were huge gouges in the plaster. There was no attempt to cover or fix it though I did notice that near the door too much paint has been applied and it has run down the wall. The bathroom was small but fully tiled on the walls. The floor of the shower stall looked like it had been repaired badly or painted and the paint was washing away. The shower head leaked continuously in spite of attempts to turn it completely off. On the inside of the door frame near the base of the shower the wood of the frame had worn away or had been broken thus exposing the cement wall inside. In spite of all these inconveniences it is still a good location. It is one block up from Macys (Seventh Avenue and 34th Street) if youre planning a shopping get-away and its in the Fashion District. It is a great place to stay if youre going to an event at Madison Square Gardens or if you wan tot visit the Empire State Building. It is ideal if youre taking an early morning train (which was our reason for staying here) or youre arriving late at night at Pennsylvania Station  its right across Seventh Avenue from the station. It is a great bargain (we paid $US109 for our 1-night stay) for midtown but you can get better prices if you shop around and if you dont mind taking the subway or buses. Other than all those reasons I cannot imagine spending more than 2 nights at this hotel. If my description of our experience at this hotel has made you re-consider staying at New Yorks Pennsylvania Hotel it would probably be worth paying more to stay at a better hotel. [Ive heard 2 opposing stories about the future of this hotel. One is that they are currently undergoing major renovations to upgrade the rooms and services but they obviously missed the 2 rooms we stayed in. The other story says that this hotel is slated for demolition to make way for some new construction but no one has told me what that is. They must done or the other because the hotel is falling apart and that is a shame because it has history and it really is a nice an unique building.],Jake450
UR92312754,2011-9-January,My first trip to New York and I had the misfortune to stay at this hotel. It is very run down and not clean. Whilst checking in was served by a very arrogent and rude receptionist who stated that we had not booked non smoking room. Luckily we had written confirmation. Then getting to my room I found long black hairs on my "clean towels" and on the floor. Room depressing to say the least with most of my electrical sockets partially hanging of the wall. Asked reception to fix this and they did send someone but they only fixed one. The sockets under the table were just bare wires with no casing. I had a very noisy couple in the room next door not the fault of the hotel but nothing was done about it. The only redeeming feature was the restaurant downstairs but later found out it had no connection with the hotel.(Hence the high quality) This hotel was by no means cheap (Christmas period working out at almost 1300 dollars for 4 nights but I wish I had paid more as it has left a bit of a black cloud over what was a great break.,TraceyH40
UR116473288,2011-9-August,I didn't listen to the reviews but the place was pretty bad. Rooms hadn't been fixed up in years peeling paint loud AC that broke while we were there bathroom door wouldn't close and there was a metal thing sticking out of the bed that hurt several of us. Caught my foot and actually bled. The smell was really bad- like grandma's attic. Hotel desk was ridiculously crowded see the attached photo. At least an hour to check in or just get a key even after 10pm. For the $179 price was totally not worth it. There is 1 elevator that takes you down to the luggage room for storage there's even a wait for that and a charge. Only good part was the convenient location across from Penn Station and no bed bugs.,fusansan
UR103402673,2011-9-April,Just to mirror some of the other reviews we also found the Hotel dirty and dark. To begin we tried to check in early but to no avail wanted to leave luggage with bell services but had to bring luggage to the "dungeon" aptly named cold dark and filthy area on bootom floor where they hold your luggage. There was a station next to the check in area labeled Bell Services but I guess that doesn`t apply to luggage holding for guests. Told to come back after 1 there should be something thencame back about 2 and the other 75 people in line must have been told same thinganyway got room 697 in back of hotel down two dark smelly corridors noticing all the large areas on walls with paint literally hanging off the walls(wondering if it`s lead paint) opening the door to the smallest room for price I have ever seen.. Opened up the curtains and viewed a brick wall 30 feet away with no view of anything The curtains were riddled with holes and tears not that any sun was going to find it`s way to the room..Smoke dectector hanging from the ceilingopened no battery(but you can rent a dectector at front desk at check in. There was no receptacle to plug in clock or light on night stand inbetween beds(I later found plug behind mattress of bed doesn`t sound to safe to me. No fitted sheets on bed tossing and turning during sleep is not optioned or you will be wrapped up in ill fitting bedding. I am just 6ft tall and feet hung iff end by ankles meust be a special size New York bed. The bathroom was horrendous paint chipped everywhere took 5 minutes to get hot water for shower shelf above sink and toilet only 5 inches wide everything falls off etc.,bampy524
UR121510532,2011-8-December,We have travelled around many countries and stayed in a variety of accommodation and we were fully expecting the room to be basic. But what we did not expect was the disgusting attitude of the staff which I have never come across in my life. It took over an hour to check in and I was met with a very aggressive man when I told him I was not happy with this. The room was so poor we found it funny that they had the cheek to ask people to pay. The only thing going for it was the location which was good and the cleaners did a good job with what they were working with and that is the only reason it has a score.,Elsawoo

UR92115879,2011-7-January,Took 3 and half hrs to book in.They told us we were not booked in even though we had proof. Absolute idiots work here. All staff incredibly rude - shockingly so. Eventually got to room via nice reception and ok lifts - to the REAL hotel. God awful corridors and terrible doors to rooms- very depressing and dark and full of dust dirty linen and bits of plaster from Walls and electric sockets covered in black soot. The rooms are even more depressing very old and tired plaster naming off Walls cracks everywhere all furniture is very old and every item was broken in some way very old grey linen with one small pillow each (asked 3 times for.more but after 3 days still waiting) the lamps did not work the phone did not work and the hairdryer did not work !! The bedroom was disgustingly dusty. And bits of dirt that I planted in a very obvious place on the carpet was never hoovered up. The maids quite obviously only come inane empty bins and make bed. The bathroom - enter at your own risk. I have never in all my years of travelling stayed in such a filthy bathroom. Ihad to clean the huge amount of dust from ALL and I mean ALL fixtures and fittings. The only good thing about this hotel is the location. Please don't waste your money pay extra and get a clean place.,MaxGloucester9
UR103147705,2011-7-April,I am an airline employee and I travel a lot because of my work and I think that now that I have visit a lot of destinations and seen many hotels I am able to give a professional opinion. I can stongly say that this was the worst I have ever been. In my trip to New york I had 12 people with me and all of them travel agents. We were all shoked from the hotel. First they did not allow us to do a group check-in ( or at least allow one of us to queue) ...nooooooooooo we had to wait for more than 1 hour to check-in and the staff was really really rude. Next thing I know is that the corridors were very very dirty and smelly. The rooms were also old and smelly but at least not that dirty. The location of the hotel was very good but this is the only good thing about it. I have never felt safe during all 3 days there and it turned that my feelings were right ( I will show more about it in below). A lot of people were in and out of the hotel without no control at all (most of them were not staying at the hotel at all). Tha last day in the evening all the others were in their rooms and I was in the lobby working in my laptop ( as in my room the hotel never took the effort to bring a LAN cable for the internet) and once I have finished I went at the elevator. Inside there was a blond guy with glasses dressed with jeans runners and an coloufull adidas shirt and seemed very calm and "safe". I have steped in the elevator and I have pressed (15 my floor) and I have noticed that the guy didnt press any button at all....Once the elevator door closed the guy looked at me and said : "DO YOU THINK THAT YOU ARE SAFE WITH ME IN THIS ELEVATOR ? " I have started shaking and I was not able to reply I only shaked my head as a yes sign..in the meanwhile he still didnt press any button. Next he introduced and wanted to shake my hand ( and I accepted as I didnt know what to do) he said that he was from Suedia and he started to laugh for no reason. Next he said that I could not go to 15-th floor and I should have gone to the top. Than he continued to talk no sense......He was not violent and he never tried to phisically approach me and also didnt seem or smell like he was drunk ( I assume he was just a psyco). Finally the door opened and I went out first and he came after me. Luckily for me he start walking faster than me and he was like 2-3 steps in front of me. I immidiatly run into the elevator again and I saw that he came back after me but lucklily for me the elevator door was closed again and he couldnt make it to come inside. I went downstars and called security and explained even on more details than above what happened. They couldnt care less and the reply I got was that it was just a bad joke from a young turist and than escorted me to the room. It was a happy ending for me ( as I was lucky and brave ).....as nothing serious happened but it was really really frightening. Please take this seriously and pay a bit more for another hotel and be safe. I really hope that you will take my review in consideration.,Hamzaraj
UR107132235,2011-6-May,This hotel was the worst hotel I have ever ALMOST stayed in! My sister and I booked through a VISA rewards points program (which will remain nameless). We understood we were not staying at a four star hotel but we did have a level of confidence that the accommodations would be suitable. We checked in and it went downhill from there. The hallway was musty and dark with chipped paint and carpet that was lifting and dirty. Our room was even worse. The pictures speak for themselves. Both managers on duty were horribly rude and the "executive room" that they tried to move us to had a window that was gaping open and would not close and the a/c unit did not blow air. After three hours of incompetence and rudeness we finally moved to another hotel and enjoyed the rest of our stay. Keep away from this hotel!! The money you save is not worth it!,vaytay
UR99190400,2011-6-March,I am a very avid world traveller who has been to over 40 countries and I have literally stayed at every type of hotel around the world and I can honestly say I have never had such a hellish hotel experience in my life. My experience is as follows: - Arrived at Pennsylvania Hotel at 11 PM tired from a long drive - Waited 45 min in checkout line - Once I got a receptionist she told me that she didn't have my reservation from priceline so I ended up waiting another 20 minutes until her manager supposedly sorted everything else. The woman working at the desk must have been either borderline mentally handicapped on drugs or extremely overworked because she kept asking me for my ID or credit card when it was already on her desk. - Finally get to one of the most disgusting hotel rooms I have ever seen. One of those places where you are afraid of catching herpes just sleeping on the bed - When I got back home I noticed an email from priceline that I had apparently never shown up to the Hotel but that I would be charged because I didn't notify early enough. That was strange considering that I HAD stayed at the hotel. - Then I noticed TWO charges from the hotel!! I had only stayed one night but they had double-charged me - I called the hotel and finally got to a person. That person asked me if I knew a Sandra...something. When I said I didn't I was treated like an idiot. When she told me that a Sandra had booked a room online but paid with my card my heart sunk - I told the woman that the receptionist was incompetent and likely made a mistake - Then this was the response she gave me "Umm no we didn't make a mistake." - I finally hung up after she refused to refund me and called my bank to dispute the charge In conclusion: DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL NO MATTER HOW POOR YOU ARE. YOU ARE BETTER OFF AT A FLOPHOUSE OR AIRPORT HOTEL THAN THIS PLACE DESPITE ITS LOCATION IN THE HEART OF TOWN!!! I mean this hotel has more "terrible ratings" than any other ratings.,nakavi
UR111816606,2011-6-June,Hotel is in an ideal location. Web site very misleading. The room that we stayed in was dingy and dirty with electrics that made you wonder how many fires they have in a year! However the linen was very clean & towels changed daily. After the initial shock of our room not looking anything like the one featured on the web site we realised what little time we spent in the room was not too traumatic. Staff friendly enough. Be prepared for a long check in time as constant queues. I would be inclined to look for another hotel however it didnt spoil our time in new york.,Merlin26
UR115093399,2011-6-July,We stayed two nights at hotel Pennsylvania in New York from the 19th of August untill August 22nd. We had a room on the 16th floor and our roomnumber was 1617a. The room was very basic muffy and the tv wasnt working. The location of this hotel was great! Right across the street from Madison Square Garden and the subway station and five minutes walk away from Times Square. The convenience of these facts makes it worth considering for a second stay in this hotel. But we found out (thanks to the NYC forum) that the hotel is nowadays in terrible condition and will be torn down soon. That is a pity but we are sure we can find a better hotel near Times Square! Have fun in NYC!,Angelique_op_Reis.
UR92024616,2011-6-January,Check-in: Line with 25/30 people. The room: filthy with broken furniture dirty bathroom and clogged toilete. I complained to the front-desk manager the second night about the general cleanliness of the room and asked for early departure (I could not stay there even for a few hours) and he was wery rude and didnt help me but of course that night I moved to another hotel without the money I had paid but happy for leaving that place. It was my 4th time in NYC and I alwayshave found good hotels for good prices. This choice was clearly a mistake.,wanessinha
UR121455521,2011-6-December,On arriving at the hotel at 10.30pm New York time after starting our trip at 11am (GMT) We thought it looked awesome!!! Got keys to room No.777.This was a room for 2 adults and 2 children(11 and 8yrs old.) There was not enough room to swing a cat. There was mouldy walls in bathroom.The ceiling paint was flaking and it smelt mouldy. We then requested another room which we waited for another 30mins. On arrival at the new room(No.310) We opened the door to the very strong smell of cigarettes and a camp bed in the middle of the room. This room was worse than the first room. So we requested another room which was (No.1002A) This room was a very large room with 4no. single beds. Still had flaky paint on the ceilings but it look slightly acceptable. My wife did although mention to the manager about having single beds only to be told" what ever room we had in the hotel was of the same standard. On the first morning while getting ready to leave the room at 8.30am. There was a knock on the room door where a cleaner asked us if we were now going out. As we weren't ready she tutted. Over-all rating of hotel - Very poor with very unhelpful staff. STAY AWAY!!!!!!,Daryl D
UR106992759,2011-5-May,This hotel was apparently built in 1919 and I don't think it has been upgraded since then. I opened my hotel door with the paint peeling off to find the woman from housekeeping sitting at the desk chair watching the very old television. The heat has not worked during my stay here and accordingly to the truly nice woman at the front desk there is no known timeline for repair. The rooms are extremely damp like being in a basement so my mold allergies are just adding to the misery. The regulator in the shower does not work correctly so the water is freezing one second and scalding hot the next. The room carpet and finishings are old and dirty and there were so few electrical outlets that I had to charge my iPad overnight in the bathroom. The only other outlet I could find was built into the lamp and only supported charging my phone. The staff have been very friendly but other than that I cannot wait to check out!,JKCPATraveler
UR118918947,2011-4-October,What an awful hotel! Long queues bad rooms. Our room was actually quite big but that doesn't help when you don't even want to walk on the carpet without your shoes on. It felt like you breathed in fungus somehow the room felt dirty. Bed bug heaven? I'm sure! Also it was so dark and gloomy I kept watching my back and turning to see behind me. It actually felt like I was walking in some housing for poor people and inside the doors people were dealing drugs. I'm NOT saying this is happening but that is the sensation I felt. And you did ask for my opinion! There are so many hotels in NYC you don't want this to ruin your trip to this great city!,marit l
UR91696597,2011-4-January,This might be a good hotel for young people but I've stayed in better hostels than this hotel... The service is very poor and some of my mom's make up products disappeared... The location is great! One block away from Macys and the 34 St! But all the rest is terrible! The pictures at the web site seems that the room is very clear and bright BUT IT IS NOT!!! I do not recommend this hotel and I would not stay there again with family... not a chance!,guigo40
UR116286093,2011-4-August,My colleague and I had to make a last minute business trip to NYC and all of our usual hotels were booked. We ended up having to go to this one. I was dismayed after reading the reviews. The positive part of the stay was that the room didn't have bed bugs -- I did a thorough check before using it. I had a fairly spacious room and it was very clean. Guest services were very efficient. I needed help closing a window and help arrived very quickly after my call. The negatives were: (1) noise - both in the hotel and outside on the street. There was some kind of machine running a loud engine outside most of my first night. The walls are paper thin and there was a family with a crying baby next door. Hallway noise was loud and ongoing for most of the night. (2) Elevators were excruciatingly slow and often full. (3) The very worst was the wait in line at the check-in desk. They had one or two very slow customer service reps and the line always had at least 15-20 people or more. This was true both for check-in and check-out -- worse than at the airport! The customer service rep was very friendly though. I can't recommend this hotel. There are so many wonderful hotels in NYC in the same price range. Look for a nice boutique hotel or one of the more comfortable chains instead.,oteaatea
UR119971725,2011-31-October,I stayed in this hotel for 4 nights and the only good thing about it is the location - right across the street from Madison Square gardens...come on now! I absolutely love NYC if you're looking for a place to hang your hat and just sleep/shower/change than this is your hotel. Do not expect any luxurious because you will not find it here. The bathrooms are an absolute joke (what is wrong with the shower curtain??). I would not stay here again. Happy Travels!,lovemexico33
UR118785720,2011-30-September,Appalling does not tell the story. This is a great location for the most terrible hotel I have ever stayed in in sixty-five years. It just won the Energy Saver Award. No wonder the halls roomscorridors lobby.... all dark and gloomy. There is a sign on each room door boasting the invention "Valet Door" from 1919. That means this hotel has the same doors from 90repeat 90 years ago! Awful staff rude and just plain nasty. The hotel will be torn down and replaced with an office tower which the city approved in 2010. Sometimes we mourn the passing of a tired old lady. This piece of rubble ain't no lady and the faster it is torn down the better.,kittyboymoi
UR119886710,2011-30-October,Recently returned from a trip to NY staying at the Pennsylvania . I knew beforehand that it was a 3 star and that it was an average price. The 4 start hotels seemed a lot more expensive. First impressions were ok very helpful man checked us in and said he would find us a nice room. He found it difficult to see on his comouters which rooms had been cleaned! As we approcahed our room on the 9th floor we were met with a disgusting patterened carpet that was disgiused by dim brown lighting. The room was very small with a carpet that you wouldn't want to walk on in bare feet! The beds were rickety and if you sat on one side they collapsed the sheets were washed but did not fit the bed therefore not tucked in and a furry cover that had obviously not been washed! I am convinced there was evidence of bed bugs and I am sure there were other creatures! The curtains were brown and dismal and hanging on. The windows had not been cleaned in year sand you didn't want to go near them. The paint was coming off the walls there were cracks and water stains. The air conditioning system had so much dust in it that I woke up with breatihng difficulties sore throat and a cold. This cleared as soon as we were outside! But the worst room was the bathroom the bath was unusable its enamel was peeling it was stained no plug and the overflow was missing and there was just a huge hole. The shower and taps were rusted and falling apart. The tiles had not been cleaned and the floor tiles were grimey. We poiltely complained and they moved us without question to floor 17 this room was much better as it was larger however it was still disgustingly unclean. I am not sure what the cleaners do in this hotel! In hindsight we should have moved again but not sure whether it got any better! However the Hotel is well situated in the heart of Manhatten you could walk everywhere and Penn station is on the doorstep. If you really only wanted to sleep in the hotel it was probably bearable. But on no account would I stay there again or reccommend it to anyone!,Becky W
UR114912296,2011-30-June,What an awful experience! My wife and I would not usually write such a bad review if it wasn't justified but our time at the Pennyslvania was a nightmare. After leaving the relatively pleasant reception area the hotel goes downhill very quickly. The corridors are shabby tired and in need of a total revamp. Our room was tiny with a view of a brick wall and was in need of a thorough clean. After our first night we attempted to leave the hotel to discover that the door would not lock from the outside therefore leaving all our valuable at risk. We reported this to reception who promised to send someone straight away. After an hour waiting in the room we reported the problem again only to be told that someone was on their way a further hour later sick of wasting our holiday in New York we packed our bags and arrived at reception to be greeted by a very rude gentleman. He was totally uninterested in the problem and the fact that we were unable to secure our luggage. We demanded the hotel store our luggage whilst we went out and it required us to escalate this problem to the manager who was able to secure us a different room later that same day. Unfortunately prior to leaving the UK we had booked a further stay at the Pennyslvania later in our holiday. On our 2nd arrival we were allocated a room with a broken tap which could not be turned off. After a further room move we were allocated a large but very unclean room... the bathroom was covered in hairs which certainly didn't belong to us and the carpet was filthy and covered in cigarette burns. In summary... Hotel is very TIRED rooms are NOT CLEAN and staff are RUDE (although are probably overun with complaints day in day out). If you can afford just a little more money per night PLEASE stay elsewhere. The great location of this hotel does not begin to outweight the negatives...,wire2009
UR94994640,2011-30-January,i ended making a huge mistake staying at this hotel. i randomly choose any cheap hotel i could find without reading reviews which was a HUGE HUGE error. always read reviews before staying at a hotel. sure the price is cheap the location is great but is it really worth what i experienced NO WAY. the lobby is really nice. when i arrived i was like OH okay fancy fancy i like it. i got my key went up stairs to my room and to my disgust as i was walking down the hallway i get a chill down my spine it felt like i had entered some sort of insane asylum. it was dark old looking broken room numbers straight out of a horror film. i get to my room the bath tub is yellow (i wanted to vomit) the towels were yellow and they smelled like corn chips. i noticed a red stain on the toilet paper. the water for the shower just trickled down no pressure at all. i didn't even want to use the bathroom it was too gross. the sheets were awful on the bed not comfortable AT ALL. the remote control for the tv didn't work so i had to get up and manually change the channels after walking so much feeling lazy and tired def not something i wanted to do. the chair at the vanity was disgusting. the seat was white like someone had some fun on it. overall i couldn't wait to leave the hotel go home take a real shower and feel clean once again. i will never ever make reservations at this hotel it needs to be remodeled ASAP.,linda3053
UR122287542,2011-30-December,I Booked a two night stay for my parents here. It looked nice and it was a great price. It's in a great location and in walk distance to most things. I was so disgusted with the room and how they were treated. The room was filthy. There light blanket that wouldn't cover much or keep you warm. They requested a blanket that never came and extra pillow that also never appeared. The outside and lobby area looks lovely but the rest of this establishment has a lot to be desired. They saw a mouse running in the hallway as they walked to their room. They told the receptionist and her response was "well it is New York what do you expect"? Do not waste your money!!!!!,Yvonne M
UR118910654,2011-3-October,Hotel Pennsylvania on 7th Avenue opposite Penn station is the filthiest hotel I've ever visited. Hotestly I doubt the have cleaned it since it was built long time ago.,LarsLyn
UR106741146,2011-3-May,My Wife and I picked the Hotel Pennsylvannia because of its location. What a mistake! Our first impression as we set our eyes on the hotel was omg. The revolving doors hadn't been cleaned for days the foyer was full of people lying (feet up) on the furniture and the receptionists was ungracious and blunt. We watched so many of those holiday nightmare shows and we always felt that the guests were over fussy but now we understand how they felt. As we made our way to our room we found tissue paper in the lift and a dark patch. Then came our room. There were toe nail clippings on the floor the heater was omitting a strange smell and the bathroom hadn't been cleaned. We made a mistake and should have read the reviews before booking. If you want a good location great hotel but be warned you'll have to sacrifice what you would expect is standard service for any hotel.,Jensen_niki
UR91521900,2011-3-January,This is a filthy hotel that smells really bad! Its very run down and aged. Rooms were a good enough size but falling apart. As I started to unpack two rats ran out from under my bed - i've never screamed so much in my life! I went straight down to the front desk (bags in tow) and asked to change rooms. they were very unhelpful and wouldn't change my room and got pushed to the back of the queue. We moved to a different hotel in the end. Not impressed and not worth a rating! Only thing the hotel has going for it is the location - but i'd rather the location be slightly further away and to have a hotel that is clean and smell free.,jgsfg
UR116224869,2011-3-August,If you are unsure of smaller boutique hotels this one will confirm that you don't always get what you expect. Stayed here first hand and have some pictures to share of the first TWO rooms they put me in (beware of the 6th floor). There were hand prints on the wall (really???) dingy air conditioning unit and mildew in the shower. I was traveling with a colleague who was put on the 13th floor and was happy with his accommodations. I asked the front desk to move me once again to that floor and was of course told there would be an increase in the rate for doing that. I feel that I was taken advantage of and that the hotel lacked customer service in general. Their attitude of "we'll just resell the room when you leave" was not appreciated either. I left after the first night. This hotel needs a major over haul!,XHotelier
UR118759714,2011-29-September,We had two rooms for one night and found the rooms dark accommodation of a very poor standard overpriced and depressing. I am glad it was for only one night but I resent the money spent there. The staff at the admission desk were unfriendly very slow and generally not sympathetic to the travelling tourist. It is not an experience I would wish on others and considering that for a short taxi ride there are a much nicer neighbourhoods there is nothing to recommend it to other than for those catching an early train.,susan D

UR102105740,2011-29-March,location is vey close to time square great shopping and subway. the hotel itself is not impressive at all below average. rooms are small and a little scary i was just waiting for a ghost to wake me on my sleep or something.,mgd1204
UR115984452,2011-29-July,Rude staff some of which can barely speak English. Never ever have I experienced anything near this atrocious level of service. Waited nearly 3 hours to check in on Sunday night. Just two very slow agents on duty?? Room was dirty and smelly. Probably no maintenance for many years. Hallways were like ovens with dirty worn carpets old faded paint everywhere. If you have a car they will charge you $50.00 a night!! They carefully never disclose this on their internet site wonder why as most decent Hotels do. Avoid at all costs  total disgrace.,jdvm1
UR122226115,2011-29-December,I have been to New York many times. I am aware of what to expect in pricing and condition of rooms. I have traveled to USA once a month for a year and a half. Two hotels have been worse that Pennsylvania. One with 7 roaches found in one minute and the other with mossy carpets. Lineups of 45 minutes to check in double beds the size of cots are the best of it. Getting of the elevator brings you to a Stephen King horror set. Painting might have occured 50 years ago. Fear of taking off your shoes in case you catch something. Didn't bother using the shower and waited to get to my next hotel which was great and half the price. The owner of the hotel should be jailed or fined for perpetrating a fraud in my opinion. Serious disapointment and I do not stay at the Ritz nor was I expecting that. You can tell who is checking in and who is coming to the counter to try and change their room. One is smiling and the other is very angry.,David F
UR117406077,2011-29-August,I stayed in this hotel based on the recommendation of my sister. She had obviously stayed in a much better room than I was offered. The first room was to say the least the worst room that I have ever been offered (anywhere). The door was broken and we had to call the caretaken . We decided that the room was not in a suitable state to stay in and we asked for a replacement room.The room smelt and the carpets and curtains were badly worn. As we were staying two nights I thought the second room would be better. Only marginally the bathtub had the enamel paint flaking off and the room was in an overall poor state. There was toothpaste on the towels when we arrived into the second room and we recieved no apology for the inconvience from the management.The standard of these rooms were third world in comfort (and I have stayed in hotels in the third world). The location of this hotel is excellent however if you really need to stay here check in advance that the room has been renovated in the last 10 years otherwise your stay will be as unpleasent as our stay was. This is a busy hotel with guests staying from around the world it was obvious to me that the management has little concern for the comfort of their guests as they see the door revolving with new guests to replace those dissatisified with the standards offered. New York is a wonderful place to visit but be advised of where you stay!!,garrytex
UR119832795,2011-28-October,We booked last minute and the price was ok. We arrived at 9pm and found check in empty and modern  no problem. Stepping out of the lift was like going back in time paint peeling old carpet and plaster falling off the walls. The doors are original 1916 but been fitted with modern card readers stepping thru the door reveals a dated tired room in desperate need of a revamp.The room was small and so were the "double"beds.On the up side we had clean sheets and the beds were made each daythe towels were clean each day and there was always hot water . The location is fantastic and the staff were very helpful. With a lick of paint it could be so much betterbut you do get what you pay for. Last point walls are thin and New york is loud all night1,gary e
UR119802031,2011-27-October,I cannot believe that this place is still allowed to operate. Damp old oppresive....AC flithy could not close window (broken hinge). Outlets hanging from wall. Hot water is hit and miss cleanliness of bathroom is very questionable. The cracked tiles in the shower really added to its ambiance. Never removed my shoes no main light in room - and I had one of the upgraded rooms......had originally 2 nights booked moved out after first night. A lot of foreign toursits staying at the hotel and if this is their first impression of the US - what an awful representation of the US and New York it is making. Considering all the health and safety regulations we have I do wonder how this place has an operating license.,360Marie
UR98201292,2011-27-February,To start off the hotel seemed quite nice. It was opposite MSG (Maddison Square Gardens) and in a fantastic location. Then I went in to the rooms. Smelt of tobacco the bathroom was rotting wallpaper peeling off the walls and freezing. Breakfast was average. This really was the sort if stuff you'd find in a horror film. Only go if you want a cheap one - night stay in NYC. (I was with a school group and it provided nothing that we wanted),HJS2011
UR105835604,2011-27-April,Stayed christmas time with the family hotle itself was not too bad and was as expected for the price- Good location though. In all my times of travelling(30 years +) this is the first hotel where I have had money stolen from my room not only did they (actually "She" it did not take the brains of an archbishop to know who did the theft) go through our bags to find a small amout of moneybut the necky thief took my loose change of about $2 in 1&5 cent copper coins. There are safe deposit boxes if you are willing to wait up to an hour for your cash as the desk tends to ignore you.,ihatethiefs64
UR119755580,2011-26-October,I stayed at Hotel Penn and the location is great! You are across from madison square garden and extremely close to subway access. From the outside the hotel looks nice and fun. The lobby is rather large and nice as well. As soon as you leave the main floor the true colors of the hotel come out. The floors look like a scene from a haunted movie and this hotel really does need to be renovated. The rooms are tiny and the beds are small as well. The floor is dirty and the bathroom is old and can use a remodel. At night time you can hear the sounds of rats and mice in the walls and my friend and i had a hard time sleeping a few of the nights. I definitely recommend staying somewhere else for the price as we then switched hotels eventually to somewhere in lower manhattan and had a WAY better room that was updated.,melerom
UR114777345,2011-26-June,Great location friendly staff but awful rooms. Bed was awful plaster falling off walls dreary rooms smelt awful. One gets what they pay for. Over priced for quality of room.

UR115781473,2011-26-July,Hotel Pennsylvania was Bad News the first night of my Stay on July 21 2011. Upon checking in I asked for an updated Room and the agent said in a grumpy voice it's to late. I took my keys for my Hotel room and went to the room assigned to me . Upon my arrival to my Hotel Room I met the door unlocked and wide open !!!! That was the first Red flag. I was scared and upset and called the Front Desk . I asked for a Manager and spoke to a nice Manager named Mark He changed my room. I felt scared for my life meeting the door of my Hotel Room opened and not Locked . Second Red Flag was day Two July 22 2011 the entire rug on the floor where the TV and the window by the Ac was was soaking wet.. I had to keep my shoes on inside m y room all the time in my room. I told the Maid outside the same day even brought her in the room and showed her . She said they would take care of it. She will tell her Supervisor. It did'nt happen. The night before my departure Saturday Night at 9:30pm is when a man from engineering knocked on my Hotel Room door telling me he was from engineering coming to look at the Ac and th water soaked Moldy rug. . I was not letting any Man from any where come in my room while alone. I told him I was leaving the next day on Sunday and it was no use to come in tonight . Do it when I leave Sunday. Whywould engineering come so so late at night  and I was out shopping all day. I reported this on the second day of my stay and only the night before m y departure engineering comes to look at the situation. An Operator named Rose was Rude when I called to tell the Manager named Mantoo about the Rug being soaked and smelling moldy she hung up on me .She had me on hold for a long time til the Manager finally came to the phone after calling back 4 times and she would'nt answer the phone seeing my room number displayed.... I went downstairs and spoke to Mantoo the Manager. .I told him this was not my first stay but it will definitely be my Last !! I told him of my Terrible stay I was having and why Operators are hanging up on guests. Icing on top of the cake was Sunday July 24 2011 That Morning I went to my Suitcase for my Money and discovered it was gone. I had $400.00 hidden in a shirt and it was Stolen Disappeared !!!!. It was there the afternoon of Saturday when I got some money out of it. It was there every day until Sunday Morning. I called Guest Services told them  they called Security which this man just toook my name and address .That's it !!! No Report was filled out or anything. I spoke to NIcole Small Asst Director of Front Services the Sunday morning before my checking out when I discovered my money stolen. She told me it would be investigated. Let's see what Happens !!! She did not tell me who cleaned my room that day my money was missing she said because of the Union . I had $400.00 stolen from me and She and Security for Hotel Pennsylvania  acted like they did'nt care as long as they got their money for my Hotel stay. I'm letting everyone know that my friends family and Co workers will never stay at the Hotel Pennsylvania when coming to New York. We will tell everyone about this Horrible Ordeal I suffered on my recent Vacation July 21 - 24 2011 at the Pennsylvania Hotel.. There are dishonest people working at the Hotel Pennsylvania in New York and they need to be weeded out.. My money was in my suitcase No one had any reason to search my Suitcase and steal my Money. My Suit Case was my Privacy.. Beware of the Hotel Pennsylvania in New York City at 401 7th ave and 33rd st.. I'm going to tell everyone about my experience. Don't Stay at the Hotel Pennsylavania they search your Suit Cases and Steal Money there !!!!!,Juttie1923
UR117287280,2011-26-August,We went to New York for our honeymoon and were VERY excited about our trip. On arrival at the hotel we were amazed by the location and how perfect it was - The Empire State was just a few blocks away Times Square was a litte further along. Maddison Square Gardens was across the road. Great access to the subway providing access to the whole city. We went to check in were impressed by the reception area; grand and elegant. We asked about an upgrade and were given a King size bed rather than a double. That was about the only good thing about the room! We were staying on the 10th floor - one window overlooked a block of offices the other I don't know as we kept the curtains shut! The carpet was thin and looked dirty. The bathroom had missing tiles and holes in both the sink and bath. The plugs were loose and only one of the four worked. The television remote was missing. The bed however was incredible and despite the constant noise from the city below we slept like babies every evening. My husband said they're in the process of renevating the hotel - they must be staying in the Pent House suites! To be fair you don't go to New York to stay in the hotel so we only really needed a room in order to sleep and freshen up from the day to evening therefore we weren't really in the room long enough from one day to the next. Ultimately you're paying for the loaction. Having said all that I still expected a little more from the room itself. The staff were mixed... there was a lovely lady on the information desk who was more than happy to assist us in finding our way from A to B. The other staff were not as helpful. The little cafe attached to the hotel was very expensive!! Our first morning we went for breakfast and didn't go again. The staff however were lovely and very friendly. All in all it was fine for what we wanted and needed but it isn't somewhere I would recommend to friends and family.,Jillian B
UR105698688,2011-26-April,Travelling with a group of girls New York was the last stop on our trip. Months in advance we had booked two rooms to sleep 3 in each. When we checked in late on the Thursday evening we was informed the hotel did not in fact have two rooms available for us. First issue considering that is what we had booked our rooms and therefore expected what we had paid for. We was finally given a second room consisting of a double bed telling us another bed would be brought to our room. Over two hours later several phone calls and trips to reception my 'cot' arrived. Tired from travelling the thin mattress on a metal frame was hardly the highlight of my trip. The fact my feet hung off the end was bad enough then the phone rings not far off 1am to check i had finally got the bed. Do this hotel not communicate?!?! Next day after a disappointing start to our stay we asked to be transferred in to another more appropriate room. At 2.15pm we was allocated a room with 2 double beds again not what we had booked. We went to the room and left items there including purchased presents and sunglasses. When we returned to the room gone 9pm all items had been removed from the room!!!! We had been checked in to the room but it appeared they had not communicated this to house keeping. We received some items back but not all after being told they was in lost and found!! (This was after several phone calls where i kept being transferred and hung up on.) Surely it was not lost if we had left them in what we thought was our room where our belongings were safe. We was later informed by an individual on the front desk that "If you leave items on the bed or floor than housekeeping dont care and could remove it" Also security told us they often had problems with items going missing....we did not feel safe leaving important items in the room after this. On top of this the hair dryer did not work the enamel was coming off the bath and the walls and ceilings had the paint peeling off it. I dont normally write reviews however i think people should be aware of my experience and looking at other reviews this is not the first time similar things have happened. So whilst it is cheap in comparison to other hotels and the location is good. You could run the risk of not getting what you booked Risk you stuff being taken from your room and staying some where that appears far from clean and well kept.,NB1983

UR109784208,2011-25-May,If you want to safe money in order to be in a great location this hotel is perfect for you. But I can say I wouldn't return to this hotel anymore. When we got there and looked around the lobby (which is nice) we thought "maybe the reviewers on Tripadvisor were too demanding. However... The Penn Station was very convenient and the location was awesome. But the bathroom was creepy the room was disgusting. In the end the rate was too high for what it was offered. I can't say our vacation was disastrous because of our choice. But it could have been much more decent.,onthegotraveler2011
UR115765000,2011-25-July,Stayed here in March 2010 with a trip to New York with college. Everything seems very nice and appealing from outside and the lobby but this is when it stops. All other floors of the hotel and rooms are extremely dated rooms tiny and neglected. On the plus side ideal as in the centre of New York and in easy reach of all the tourist attractions.,TheUKLegend
UR98002207,2011-25-February,My best friend and I came to see the Westminster dog show and were so excited to stay where the dogs stay even though the reviews weren't great. Most noted it was an older hotel with small rooms that was somewhat dingy and in need of updating but that didn't deter us because we wanted to be where the dogs were. Dingy and old I could handle just fine. What I was not prepared for and would not tolerate was that the room was disgusting - the bathroom was dirty there wasn't enough water pressure to take a shower (even though I was pretty skeeved out a shower would have been nice after a 3000 mile trip) and essentially the room was so unappetizing and gross we didn't even want to take our shoes off and kept our luggage on top of the television and the dresser to keep our things from touching the carpet. The room didn't have anything but sheer curtains and was bright all night from the outside light so we didn't sleep either. By 7 am I was making alternative arrangements and we moved out before breakfast. We came back to visit all the dogs in the lobby on our own time and had a perfectly lovely room at the Hilton Garden Inn on W28th for the rest of our stay for less money. Despite it's central location there are simply too many hotel options in this wonderful city to tolerate such appalling conditions. I will say the staff we interacted with were pleasant enough. There I said something nice.,Moonchild59
UR105412708,2011-25-April,I usually do not write reviews but I thought it might be useful to someone who's planning on staying there. I stayed at the Hotel Pennsylvania this weekend with a friend from the UK. As I entered the room to my dismay I noticed the paint was peeling of the walls and the walls were quite dirty. The bed was really small & quite lumpy. I called for 2 extra pillows on the 1st nights stay & I never rec'd them. I would say the service was poor. OVERALL! I would not give a THUMBS UP to this hotel. GOOD LUCK!,kimmykim12
UR109592462,2011-24-May,The hotel looked nice from the outside and in the lobby it was big marbled and lovely. However when we started walking through the corridor to our room with the 70's carpet i thought mmm. But when we got into our room. Budget is not the word! the walls were crumpling the plug sockets hanging off the wall. The tv was something from the 60's. The bathroom was sort of clean although the shower could have done with a good scrub. I know you go to new york to see the sights but this really put a dampner on our holiday. iknow that u tip however outside the hotel we flagged down our taxi got in but then the hotel porter stopped the taxi and wouldnt let us leave until we gave him a tip. It has really put us off going to new york again which is a shame.,lucyjjo85
UR97892473,2011-24-February,Worst hotel in the world. Great location but it is simply rubbish!! It is so old and run down. You really can't believe how bad this place is unless you experience it.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR117173407,2011-24-August,What I liked about the hotel was the location and price. There are bars within stumbling distance and a few blocks away from Times Square. The rate per night was descent. If you're on a budget traveling alone and don't care much this would be cool. Only issue regarding the billing is they charge $4.00 to hold your luggage. Every hotel I have been in has never done this. So this was a shock. The room itself is a bit dingy. The window doesn't prop open. You have to remove the lower half to get outside ventilation. Also the shower is crap at best. It looks old and dirty and the bathtub has significant yellowing. The shower head itself shoots water out pretty hard. So if you need to shower don't turn the knobs up all the way. I got a room with a king size bed. It was nice and comfortable. But there is alot of dust on the outdated appliances including the radiator. The lobby looks really cool. But the elevators and floors are nasty. And the business center is terrible. Internet is slow barely any features on the computer. Doesn't allow you to open PDF files. If you have to use internet pay for the WiFi which is $10/day or go down to Kinko's to print stuff. I would personally recommend spending the extra buck and staying somewhere nice like the Hilton. Only reason I didn't stay at the Hilton was because they didn't have any rooms available. If I spend money to stay somewhere I expect it to be clean comfortable and appealing. Pros: Price location Cons: Cleanliness out of date appliances horrible business center dingy bathroom charge to hold luggage no hospitality room.,LA_Traveller13
UR118510381,2011-23-September,For a three night stay I paid 1050 usd. This included a grotty cell like room. No breakfast no internet A 30min queue just to check in Extremely Rude staff A dirty bathroom Seems this hotel thinks location alone is good anough NEVER AGAIN,divemanMexico
UR119640772,2011-23-October,The only beneficial thing about this hotel is the location. Other than that there's mold on the walls of the bathroom the air conditioning/ heater is broken you have to figure out the hot water on the knob of the shower if not it comes out cold (turn it little by little till you find the hot water or you might miss it) there's flying insects coming out of the drain.... definitely not worth the 230.00 a night. I rather pay 400 a night for a hotel that probably won't give me an infection.,LizABC
UR101311441,2011-23-March,Word to the wise $175 per night is way too much to spend (I don't care if it is Manhattan) on a hotel that is absolutely dirty. Seriously soap costs how much? I expected not the most up to date decor but there is NO excuse for the filth this place should be shut down!!!!! Spend the extra money to stay somewhere decent I couldn't sleep staying at the hotel penn and I was afraid to use the washroom because it was so dirty... wrecked my trip and was a waste.... I am still grossed out about the whole experience....yuck!,cmccombe
UR118444140,2011-22-September,I didn't mind the long check-in line but I did not appreciate the ignorance of the check-in staff. They didn't welcome us to the hotel (because they don't care). They didn't offer to explain the hotel ammenities. I asked for a comment card when checking out and they handed me a blank sheet of computer paper....what???? The room was filthy. There was a dead bug squished on the dirty drapes. The carpet must not have been cleaned in a decade. The bed was uncomfortable. The bathroom sink was missing one of the four legs. I thought it was going to fall onto the floor. The TV had a quarter inch of dirt on the screen. Best of all there are paint chips falling from the ceilings over the beds!!!!! I would NEVER stay here again. They just don't care about their customers.,Kat S
UR120935500,2011-22-November,Mold on the bathroom ceiling. Dark hallways that clearly have not seen the inside of a paint can in years. Dated shabby rooms. For $200 plus per night we could have stayed at the Y and had a better experience. I will say that the maids were nice. The people behind the desk were rude. JUst don't do it!!!,DivaBach
UR109286259,2011-22-May,The line waiting to check in took over an hour. We lost the key card on one occasion and that took another hour to be seen by the front desk. On entering the room the decor is dowdy and appears not to have been refurbished in decades. The room was filthy the TV didn't work and actually had a big hole in the front of it. When we phoned to ask for it to be fixed we were told they were 'very busy'. Nobody showed. The staff appear to have lost all hope. When we asked how to complain at the front desk they said there was no system for that. Spoke to a manager who seemed to suffer complaint fatigue and said he couldn't authorize any cancelation and repayment of the money already paid to the travel company. We checked out anyway as this is the worst hotel I've ever stayed in by a very large margin and it would have been too depressing to spend the rest of our NYC stay in that establishment. It should be closed down. I can't believe travel companies send people there.,sc12258
UR101169487,2011-22-March,This hotel is by far the worst hotel i have ever stayed in. Staff is rude... Rooms and bathrooms are FILTHY. Very dirty dusty moldy. Would never stay again.,footprint123

UR117102101,2011-22-August,Too old  but the localization is very good. We can find very interesting attractions a few steps from the hotel. (Madison Square Garden Macys etc),AndersonLeal
UR119567760,2011-21-October,This hotel is very old so it's been worn down by all New York tourists for about 100 years. The rooms are very big considering that it's New York but it's kinda dark inside & filthy. Location is very good because it's right next to Madison Square Garden and 34th street so there's tons of thing to do plus it's NY so there's no reason to be in your room anyway. Price is average going rate of about $200 a night for 2 full beds but the remember it's not as sparkling clean as you want it to be.,x10white
UR120881228,2011-21-November,Stayed here end of October 2011 - took a long time to check in - the original room we were given was tiny and dark - the bed was a small double and quite wobbly on its legs - the bathroom was not good at all it didn't even have a toilet seat let alone a shower curtain! I returned to reception to ask for a rooom change and was asked to come back tomorrow after mid-day - although this was a major inconvenience in view of the fact that we had limited time in New York I decided that I would. After an even longer wait at reception I was finally given an upgrade to a much better room - it was larger and brighter with a large kingsize bed - however it was not particularly clean and very shabby decor wise to say the least. The entire hotel could do with major redecoration particularly the bathrooms. Having said all that it is in a brilliant location.,Trudi58
UR101037779,2011-21-March,This is the worst hotel I have stayed in ever! The rooms were shocking. The bathroom was grubby bath stained and rusting shower tap hanging off wall. thick mold covering the shower curtain elec socket coming away from wall. The carpets hadn't seen a hover in months. Bed linen stained and coverings were falling apart. The staff were very unhelpful and rude. I have travelled to many countries and this is the worse. Comparable to staying in third world. Only good thing central to everything.,terioo7
UR114620710,2011-21-June,My wife and I stayed in the Penn Hotel a couple weeks ago when we were in NYC for our daughter's college graduation. It was supposed to be a fun time. We arrived and were given a room on the 4th floor. Walking down the hall made you feel like you were in a submarine. The doors have this small insert in them that makes them feel very small. We entered the room where the lights and TV were on. I thought we had been given the wrong room but after calling out loudly no one answered. The next thought was someone laying dead in the bath tub. The carpet was filthy. Stains on it and in need of vacuuming. We called the front desk and they moved us to the 11th floor. A slight improvement as the lights and TV were off when we entered the room but about as bad. I would go out of my way to never stay there again and tell as many people as I know not to either. This is a hotel hell.,hawkeyejohn11
UR119532003,2011-20-October,Staff were helpful and mostly friendly and the bed was comfortable but that was the best that could be said of this hotel. Having paid for what was advertised as a larger room I was surprised to find the room small and dingy. One powerpoint looked like a fire hazzard. They even charged me to leave a bag for 3 hours after my checkout before I left the city. Not recommended.,Jan R
UR109100538,2011-20-May,Last minute business trip and needed a central location. I discovered there is a reason the Hotel Pennsylvania had the only room with conferences and graduations in town. This is the most filthy pit I have ever stayed in. My business associates joked me about bedbugs but I couldn't bring myself to pull back the sheets to check knowing I had no options. I came up with every excuse to stay out of the hotel/room and used the location as a great starting point for early morning runs. When I jogged past some people sleeping under blankets in central park I briefly contemplated the fact that I would be in more sanitary conditions if I slept in the grass. Unfortunately I needed to be able to shower shave and put a suit on. I barely slept for fear of what may be lurking in the darkness. Couple that with the drunk in the next room trying to open the lockoff door at 2 am and this was a horrific experience at a stiff price.,Dabiztravler
UR114582360,2011-20-June,Literally steps away from Penn Station and Madison Sq. Garden. That is the ONLY thing that is good about this hotel! Decent check in area. We stayed there 5 days 4 nights. EVERY TIME we took elevator only 3 were working during our trip. The doors to the rooms looked like they were from an insane asylum! The carpet was thread bare tub had a multitude or cracks no lock on bathroom door and no stopper in sink. We went to People's Court for taping got back to change (since it was 99 degrees outside and we dressed up) got back to room at 3:30 pm housekeeping didn't hesitate to take the tip $$ BUT ROOM WASN'T EVEN CLEAN YET. PLUS go into the bathroom and THERE WAS A FREAKING COCKROACH CRAWLING IN SINK!!!!!!! Called management - no sorry only "I'll move you". Ya think!!! Walking through hallway to elevator (no hallways were air conditioned by the way) to get to new room on 7th floor my daughter tells me OH MY GOD DON'T LOOK UP. Well what's the first thing I do - LOOK UP!! Big mistake - more cockroaches in light fixtures!!!. Went into room new room and shower was non-stop running - NO way am I going to listen to that all night!!!! They put us on the 14th floor where they said it was renovated. Sure bathroom was decent but again the carpet was thread-bare. PLUS we could hear the other occupants in the other rooms talking. Walls aren't thick enough. Thank God it was hot and we were at least able to turn on the air conditioner to drown out their mouths! We had a continental breakfast every morning - 3 dirty tables to choose from inside a small room and coffee juice bagels (to toast in a dirty toaster) and sweet rolls. There is no way that I would ever recommend this hotel!,moresitestosee
UR121931583,2011-20-December,I'm amazed that such a run down dump as this hasn't been shut down. I cannot believe that it cost 100 for a night's stay. The staff were rude. The room was filthy and the whole place felt in the mid stages of decay. The walls in the corridors and rooms were a disgrace the carpets filthy and torn. (I think the sheets and towels were clean but wouldn't vouch for the blanket or bed cover!). An absolute disgrace.,Lisa W
UR116980322,2011-20-August,This hotel is the first thing you hit what getting off a train....it's a way station for people who don't know where they are..I used to walk through the lobby as a shortcut to Herald Square. It "is" almost like sleeping on the street. Yeah the location is great if you wouldn't mind sleeping in Penn Station either cause that's practically what you're doing! There's lot of homeless people who sleep there too. lol I do remember all the dog owners. Ah Only in New York. Guess Bloomberg better step in on this one like Times Square. Clean up the underbelly of the city which is all over NY. Don't be so naive people the whole city stinks.,spectatrice
UR98663997,2011-2-March,The room was disgusting!!! Wouldn't touch anything there without gloves not to talk about walking around in the room with out shoes YUCK!! There was BLACK MOLD on the walls the walls were cracked and were about to peel off the bathroom is nasty! The shower kept leaking the entire time (two days at least) you could not turn off the faucet and couldn't shut the door to the bathroom!!! On top of all that they CHARGED MORE THAN THE PRICE I received when I made the reservations!!!!!!!!! I made the reservations by phone and was told it would be $99 per night (that was the price on their website as well) but when I came to check out they said it was a mistake and that the price is actually $114 a night (not including tax) and they MADE ME PAY that amount!!! I called the manger who BARKED at me and called me a liar!!!!!!!!! Bottom line: DO NOT GO THERE!!!!!! IT IS NOT WORTH IT!!!,shira_11
UR95274710,2011-2-February,On arrival at the hotel there was no queue and we were quickly checked in. However we were not even pointed in the direction of the lifts to get to our hotel rooms so we had to find our own way. We are non-smokers but were placed in a smoking room which smelled vile and the bathroom was unclean - there was makeup smeared on the shower curtain and black grime at the bottom of the bath. We didn't ask to change because we were on the same floor as the rest of our group and had a twin room- both things they seemed to have a challenge finding at check in. We cleaned the bathroom ourselves and sprayed some airfreshener which helped. The bed linen seemed clean and the room was spacious enough. On exploring the area we found that the location of the hotel is excellent. On the second day while we were out somebody came to clean our room. When we got back to the room this person had spilled an unknown substance all over our dressing room table. This had leaked into the drawers below where we were storing our clothes. It had also made some marks in the varnish and our tv remote control was damp. They had removed the clothes from the drawer put them on a chair and put a towel in the drawer (leaving us one towel short). The tv remote did not work after that and was the only way to use the tv. After this incident we hung our 'do not disturb' sign up and left it there for the remainder of our trip.,Paul186518
UR121315547,2011-2-December,My friend and I stayed here on a shopping Trip and booked before reading these reviews. All I can say is that I am not fussy in the least and wasn't planning on spendnig time in the room (hence us going there for shopping) but what I can say is pay an extra $50.00 and stay elsewhere. We stayed on the 3rd floor in room 313 - It's haunted and I don't believe in ghosts. The ceiling was hanging off with paint and plaster The Light switches plug sockets are not safe for any human Carpets and bedding smell of mould Bed bugs on my friends bed The bathroom is beyond vile - rust/dirt/stench Noisy from every angle Zero sleep in 3 days and lived on redbull Try to move rooms and that failed Tried to move hotel and that failed I REPEAT DO NOT STAY - WORSE THAN ANYTHING I'VE EVER STAYED IN!,TAM_SEB
UR102546611,2011-2-April,The only helpful person there was Natasha. Everyone else yelled at us. Rooms are not what they look like. Bathroom leaked water. It's about 10 blocks from time square. The staff ruined my last day there won't stay there again.,sandrar77
UR120789459,2011-19-November,check in took forever hardly anyone speaks perfect english the place is falling apart aside from the lobby which is the only decent part of the hotel. our room was not ready 30 mins after check in time so they had to give us another one that apparently a blind person cleaned bc it was disgusting. used soap left in the shower hair on the floor and toilet seat. blankets had hard crusty parts on them. The only nice people there were the men in the basement who hold your bags before check in. worst hotel ive ever stayed in and i am a poor community college student the location is good thou but not that good,jeffery e
UR109005045,2011-19-May,Upon reading some of your other reviews stating the accomodation was reasonably priced well I for one think it was way OVERPRICED for the state of the place. My first visit to America what a disappointment. Do you not have hotel inspectors checking STANDARDS? Terrible state of disrepair. Has it actually been painted since it was built? Bedroom doors what is that all about? The question of SMOKING was never mentioned to me and I was digusted with the constant smell of this and other unknown aromas....Hall and Bedroom carpets I would'nt dare walk in my bare feet was'nt sure what I would pick up. My family and I consisted of 9 visitors from Canada and Scotland I was totally embarrassed as I had suggested your hotel. Will never recommend to anyone again.,peggysue472
UR118284955,2011-18-September,The Pennsylvania is a dump - and a huge one. Despite its superb location right across Madison Square Penn Station and Macy's around the corner it's a terrifying experience. It starts with long lines for check-in and ends in a skunky small room with scruffy blankets and stains all over the carpet. Not to mention the worn out bathroom. The only positive thing was that our bicycles (rentals) could stay overnight in the storage room as we joined next day the Five Boro Bike Tour. Consider spending a bit more for a decent place in NYC; otherwise for the same money you can book a 4-star hotel in Jersey City (see my other reviews) or Newark all within easy reach of PATH trains.,supergaggle
UR119437163,2011-18-October,I booked my room at this hotel based on the pictures on their website and the price. I was in town for a conference nearby. I was very disappointed. The pictures didn't match the actual rooms at all. The lobby looks immaculate and the location is convenient but that's about it. Check-in on a Thursday night at 10 pm took 20 minutes. There were 3 attendants checking in a long line of people. The attendants were not friendly. They were argumentative with guests who were obviously disappointed with what they got. When I went to the 7th floor and found my room the door was open. When I opened the door I was slightly worried that someone was going to jump out of the shower with a butcher knife. Once I turned on the light I noticed the threadbare dirty carpet. The room itself was depressing. The bathroom dirty. No hair dryer (as promised on website). I stayed in a room with two queen beds. Both beds were rock hard and uncomfortable. The pillows flat and stiff. I stayed in a corner room and every night (I stayed 4 nights) there was a banging sound. I couldn't figure out what it was - luckily I had a white noise app on my iPhone to drown out the horrible sound. I wouldn't stay here again or recommend it to anyone.,Kelly W
UR100567336,2011-18-March,I'm writing this...from inside the hotel. The slow internet connection allowing me to do so not incidentally is costing an absurd $10 per day. This is only the tip of the outrage iceberg: earlier today checking in took nearly an hour. AN HOUR. For the pleasure of picking up my key. The staff was surly unpleasant and disingenuous when they suggested that this was an anomaly: I had in fact stopped by earlier to check in and had given up because the line then was just as interminable. I will also briefly mention that the hotel is in mild disrepair full of dingy carpets and scuffed paint. The lobby even discounting the lines of bedraggled travelers looks like an ode to Soviet Brutalism. These things as such would not be very damning for me because I am not the sort of traveler who needs excessive luxury or hipness in the places he stays. But in conjunction with a nickel-and-dime internet policy and an unprofessional staff that allows their patrons to wait for unreasonable lengths of time this place becomes absolutely inexcusable. Do not let this hotel continue to coast on its location: take your money elsewhere.,AK533
UR115508554,2011-18-July,I was in town for business and I travel to the city pretty frequently. That being said I've stayed at many different hotels in Manhattan. This was by far and away the WORST hotel i have EVER had in the city!!!! I found the staff to be friendly.... well that was after I waited over an hour to check in!!! I was told that SOME of the rooms were renovated well let's just say I wasn't lucky enough to get one of those rooms. My bathroom sink was literally falling off the wall. The paint was repulsive and chipping away from the walls. And the "A/C" is certainly not A/C!!!! Don't be fooled by the pictures on the website this place is unacceptable in my opinion!!!!!!!!!!,lesliejoann
UR97082412,2011-18-February,Hotel Pennsylvania is an old tired lodging.We stayed there for the West Minister Dog Show It is in need of a major upgrade from old and dirty to broken and worn out.The staff was friendly and helpfull.The rumor is that it will be torn down to make way for a large skyscraper. A prime location across from Madison Square Garden it needs to be renovated for the traveling publicas it has great potential for the future.,STEVE131111
UR116919458,2011-18-August,The view in the lobby was wonderful. A person would really think that this would be a great hotel but this is where it all ends. It is just to get you in! When we checked in the first thing they told you is that there is a $50 dollar early check out fee and if you wanted internet service you would have to pay and asked for a credit card. I did not think anything of it because from what I have seen so far everything look great. When we try to go to the elevators there is a gentleman there (like a guard) who stops us and says you cannot bring up you own luggage and that a bell-hop must bring it up via the service elevator. Again I did not think much of that either. So we waited for the bell-hop who begins to take our luggage to our room and we left to go to our rooms. Once out of the elevator everything changes! The smell of old stained wet musty carpet is overwhelming. Walking down the poorly lit hallway with falling plaster falling paint chips everywhere you look doors CHAINED CLOSED doors busted open. The longer I walked the madder I became but it does not end there. Once to our room door which was filthy paint peeling marred we opened the door to a room that has not been renovated for many years! I'm guessing 50yrs! The room had a dark brown carpet that smelled old and musty the carpet does not look as it has been changed in fifty years. The door bolt was literally just hanging on the door by 1 screw. Old bed old tube tv with a broken remote held together by black tape. A hole in the wall where an electrical socket used to be an electrical socket that does not work. Four person room with towels and wash cloths for two people. Old marred and scratched furniture no clock broken hair dryer a view of garbage from our window which has bars on them. Now as I sat there I started thinking why they are charging a $50 dollar early check-out fee why a bell-hop takes your luggage why the lobby was so nice. It is all to get you in and keep you there. When you read this you may think that maybe I am too picky or high maintenance. This is not the case at all. I have stayed in many hotels and motels in my life. This hotel is simply disgusting! I have never stayed in a hotel like this. Please do not stay here. You will really regret them taking your money and making you feel like a fool! Look at the photos from people who have posted them. These pictures cannot convey the disgust of this hotel! IF YOU DO NOT BELIEVE ME PLEASE DO THIS FIRST!. Get at the hotel before check-in time a go to directly to the elevator (DO NOT CHECK IN) and see for yourself. If you like living in a disgusting hotel for a couple of days then go back down stairs and check-in. If you don't go back out the doors a get a cab and ask them where to find a good hotel of if you have a laptop make a right out the doors you came and go to McDonalds which has FREE internet service and look for another hotel. I really hope this helps you. New York is awsome and I hope you have a wonderful time. I think you will!,Andy O
UR104557111,2011-18-April,I hate to say it  but this place is really really BAD!!!!! Waiting on line for a sold out international flight during a high terror alert status is faster more enjoyable than check in at this nightmare hotel. after that hour and a half experience we went to to our room that looked like some one was already there. the bed was not made the tv was blaring the bathroom was a obviously not cleaned  we actually thought we had the wrong room when we called the front desk the reply was "you do realize this is only a 2 star hotel". I still cant figure out how they pulled off that many stars! The only saving grace is that we checked in very late and left very early the next day. I heard that this is the offical hotel for the westminster dog show I just cant imagine anyone letting there dog stay here. Do your homework before coming to NY. Many better hotels at even better prices and locations. In hind sight we both feel very stupid for staying here,zipp1212
UR120693476,2011-17-November,Found this hotel to be an excellent location but in complete need of a refurbishment and a good clean. For the price paid there are much better Manhattan hotels.,daren777
UR108728234,2011-17-May,Where should I start. Took 45 min to check in. When I reached my room there were dirty towels on the floor only one light worked none of the outlets had covers cold water in sink did not work sink did not drain. I told the front desk I was checking out and they stated they had nobody there to clean the room and I would be charged. This place is the worse hotel I have ever been in. Do NOT stay here. Warn your friends family co-workers etc about this place.,worldtraveler1868
UR115434838,2011-17-July,If you can stand not to think of what might be on the floor/bed and only plan on sleeping briefly for a few days..then stay. The location is great especially if you are travelling through penn station staff was more than wonderful when I needed to change dates from a family emergency print out tickets directions.. I HEARD some rooms were updated..For as busy as it was in lobby I hope they hurry and renovate all rooms soon..bad news spreads fast. I would think that hotel owners would want to provide electrical outlet covers and somewhat fresh paint in all rooms if only for appearances. At least create the illusion of a kept hotel if you can't afford to re-do entire room..And dont bother buying the 5000 room it only gets you acess to 24/7 coffee and breakfast? plain bagels and store bought muffins for 15$ I would have bought 3 dunkin donut coffee's and a decent pastry around the block..All of the hotels staff I encountered were awesome..Desk bell hop front door and even managment went out of their way to help.,FitnessProLiane
UR93435227,2011-17-January,I just checked I'n today this hotel looks more appealing from the outside the inside is outdated rooms are small I just found dirty towels bathroom looked dingy paint is chipping on the walls room doors look like jail cells carpets are dirty .. Walls are squalid .no inernet I'n rooms .overall looks like an old welfare prostitution camp and just think I have two night uuggh smh!!,Qiyamah100
UR121833538,2011-17-December,The bath tub did not drain for hours and the corners were gross. There were cracks on the wall everywhere. However it was warm. The employees down stairs did not know New York at all. When asked where the nyairporter bus was located for pickup they had no idea.,Laurie W
UR120681682,2011-16-November,If this site would let me I'd post a picture of the black mold on the ceiling and the hole in the wall. The carpet was ripped and rumpled. Check-in tool 50 minutes and he front desk workers were rude and incompetent.,CCMOH
UR100427360,2011-16-March,Hotel service is non existant. The whole staff is very rude and don't even try to work with you unless you makle a big scene. We had to rquest to be moved to another room. Most of their rooms are very old and dirty. Most of us didn't have hot water in either our bathroom sink or shower. The heaters didnt work properly. the heater has only one setting: High. It cant be lowered so you need to heat up the room and then turn it off later so you dont roast. The paint is peeling off the walls and the walls look like they havent been wiped in like NEVER. I would never recommend anyone stay at this place. I read a lot of reviews before I went and they were all horrible and negative but I thought it was simply their bad luck. However after staying here for a weekend I now know all the reviews are 100% true. DON'T stay at the Hotel Pensylvania,CYNsin
UR113919466,2011-16-June,This is a hotel which needs a major overhaul and rennovation. Its very large and inexpensive but the check in service is horrible no matter what time.Understaffed! There is no bill in your room when you depart so you need to wait another half hour to get a copy upon departure.. Too few people on staff and not well trained. They gave me a smoking room when I requested non smoking. Waited in line (they are extensive) about 30 min to get another room. Be advised its a tourist hotel and cheap and rooms are musty! The only saving grace is its near Penn Central and pretty central. You get what you pay for.,bostongolfers
UR115424835,2011-16-July,I just stayed at the Hotel Pennsilvania and the customer service was not good. My internet wasn't working and it took 3 phone calls to try and get an IT person to my room but they still didn't come up so I had to come down to the lobby to switch rooms The room had bed bugs and I have bites all over my legs And one of my rooms wasn't cleaned at all. I was in the lobby to use my laptop and supposedly I had my plug in an outlet I wasn't allowed to use so one of the employees just unplugged it and told me to find another plug quite rudely,laurawesome
UR93124330,2011-16-January,So the only good thing about this hotel is that it's right across the street from the Penn Station and a few miles from all the main attractions but the service is just absolutely non-existent. All the front desk people were lousy and not service-oriented. Many were on their cell phones in their own little world and they treated us rudely. The one and only friendly staff we encountered in this entire hotel during our week-long stay was the morning luggage man downstairs. He should get a raise! As for the rooms? Worn out and disgusting. The carpet was sticky.,isoblah
UR119297438,2011-14-October,Stayed in Hotel Pennsylvania for 3 nights. Not worth the money. Hotelroom dirty had to quee for 20 min. everytime I wanted to speak with the reception and only internet in the lobby (that had to be paid for). Location of hotel OK but try to find a better and cleaner hotel.,agneta m
UR121741777,2011-14-December,The hotel's location is great but the hotel is just no good. The pros are: the location the fact that it has 12 elevators so you never have to wait for one to arrive. It's also not expensive compared to other hotels in NYC. The cons are: the air conditioning does not work (at least ours didn't) the bathroom is very old and not very well kept the shower is crazy (you can get burned like five times during a 10-minute shower and there's almost no water pressure what so ever) the hotel has like a million rooms so the lobby area is always very very crowded the rooms are very dark and the hotel needs a makeover urgently. It's quite old.,Gabo13
UR118082980,2011-13-September,This was my first visit to NYC hence being opposite to Penn station was great. The room are really small shabby and advisible if you want to crash out for a few hours only. Hotel is too busy one has to wait for long to get a checkin. Staff though courteous cant do much to help you. There are coffee shops restaurants and take away shops all around to keep you busy. Wakling distance from Time Square overall a good place if you plan to be out of hotel for most of your stay. Economical by NYC standards,Vivmodi
UR119272438,2011-13-October,First of all to check in we had to wait almost 30 minutes the front desk is huge but there are only 3 employees. They don't really care about the customers and they're not particularly helpful and friendly. We took the old and dirty elevator to our room on the 10th floor and what a surprise! Dust mildew in the bathroom the toilet is not even clean I don't really wanna describe it We called the front desk and asked for a room move.The person who answered first put me on hold without a word which is very upsetting! When we saw the 2nd room on the 4th floor this one was worse than the first!!! I really thought it was a joke! There was smell of tobacco dirty foot print on the bathroom floor As you can understand we became very upset and they gave us another room on another floor nothing changed I guess nobody cares about sanitary conditions in this hotel. We asked to see the manager but she could not give us something better she was rude with us and told us that if we want something better we have to go somewhere else Guess what we did? Of course we found another hotel near Times Square cheaper and just renovated! (I'm gonna write a comment on this hotel too a good one!) I understand that a hotel is old but I can't take a nasty place like that! Don't go there if you don't wanna sleep with rats!,Celiasp
UR120551653,2011-13-November,We had a group of seven people stay at Hotel Pennsylvania from for two nights We had two rooms book 4 people in one room and 3 people in the other room. We checked it after 27hrs hours of traveling at 1am and of course were exhausted and the lady at the counter had no idea what she was doing. She was completely confused and so were we. It took well over 30mins to check in. She took our passports and had to keep doing the same thing with them because she was distracted and wasn't paying attention as she was partly on the phone while checking us in. It wasnt busy; we were the only ones there so she has no excuse for being incompetent. They rooms we booked were not cleaned so they gave us an extra room. (I dont understand why the room was not ready when we arrived at 1am in the morning there should have been ample time to get it ready). She didn't tell us where to go or what level we were on. We got to the rooms and there was only enough beds for 6 people not 7. We had to check each room all in different levels lugging our luggage around to try and find which room had the extra bed hidden. Eventually we gave up and didn't want to go complain because she was useless. Three of us just slept in the king bed for both nights. The other thing was our window was open so our room was freezing as it was about to snow the next day. We got three keys for one of the rooms and two of them didn't work and the door wouldn't shut properly so this was another inconvenience. I also asked the lady at check in if there would be any charge or on hold money when she took our credit card numbers. She said no. One of the cards got charged $40 and has been returned to her now but I was charged $267.70 and it has not been returned. I called the accountants twice now and no one can tell me why I was charged this amount. It's a very random number when we checked out they said there was no extra charges for extra services. We were very unhappy with our stay at Hotel Pennsylvania and higher standards were expected of the hotel and hope that no one else has to go through what we did.,i_an_outtathaway
UR108051016,2011-13-May,we went for superior roomit was tiny tired and dated reception looked and felt like train station obviously managagement feel they do not need to spend money on improvements. we were on 15th floor at one side so at least there was very little noise. it is easily possible to get better hotels in similar area for same price shopping for those is very very important.,patrick090
UR103971481,2011-13-April,There is nothing special about this hotel. But in a city with astronomical hotel prices the pickings are slim. It's old hasn't had a coat of paint or maintenance in a long time. But I didn't feel unsafe. It is packed with people yet I had the quietest night in NY I've probably ever had. When I've stayed in friend's beautiful million dollar apartments and you hear sirens garbage trucks people walking etc. But my interior room (window looking into an air shaft) was super quiet. Would I stay here again probably not. I'd probably look for another cheap option. Plus there were three double beds in our huge room (per our request). Now that is unusual!,aselco
UR119235512,2011-12-October,Ouch!!! I made a mistake which could only be described as monumental when at short notice and without checking checked into the HotHell Pennicylin-required-vanian. After receiving my key card I made my way to the public restroom before taking the elevator to the Filth floor on knocking at the locked door It was opened and I was greeted by a male prostitute touting for business after decling he left with his "friend" inside I was met by profuse graffitti ironically almost all Homophobic (and racist) in nature. The signs were there. Next I took the elevator to the Filth floor correctly named as the filthy carpet was was covered in white delousing powder upon opening the door things got even worse (yes) not only was the room liberally sprinkled with the same delousin agent it was filled with a noxious substance used for killing roaches. Exit stage left. Two minutes later I'm in the lobby screaming and yelling at the manager (I'm British no shame) result full refund given with no penalty. Thirty minutes later I'm in a superb private residential apartment in The Chelsea Hotel Building on West 23rd Street. Strange thing it cost less than the the hellhotel on 7th.,Chris M
UR92631205,2011-12-January,After waiting in the airport style check in reception for nearly an hour (at 11pm!) we eventually got to our room off a corridor that reaked of cigarette smoke and that looked as though it hadn't been redecorated since the 1960s. There was a fault in the room and we had to ring reception 3 times before the maintenance guy finally came up. BY this time it was after midnight and given we'd flown from France we were wrecked. Pretty poor service. The concierge desk was very helpful - really the only highlight in service for this hotel.,CJH65
UR121653174,2011-12-December,I visited NY 2nd Dec 2011 for 4 nights with family. This hotel had nice glossy pictures on trip advisor and some good somehorrible ones and bad reviews well I travel lots for work and don't pay attention to the reviews much as most places seem to be fine when you get there the line of busienss I am in i book hotels for staff and generally we all feel the same it is fine that the hotels are fine when you get there. THIS HOTEL WAS FAR FROM IT I WILL ADHERE TO TRIP ADVISOR FROM NOW ON!! The lobby seemed ok the Chritmas tree and decorations anyway the staff were nice enough so we made our way to our 3 double bedded superior room out of the lift we came to a corridor dark and dingy the doors had apparently the original valet door stuck to it from the 1920's they curve out and remind me of a jail door my sister commented it looked like something out of an old asylum or something THE DIRT WAS LEFT OVER FROM 1920'S by the look of them anyway on we went to the room. 3 single beds the maid was changing the beds and cleaning! so we waited we could see the matresses stained and very uninviting the clean sheets were threadbare and well stained with what could only be described as various bodily fliuds the outer cover was not changed and on one of the beds there was excrament on that outer cover. The light shades torn the lamps covered in dust the television and cabinet you could plant veg in the dirt the window would not close we asked for someone to come sort it it didnt happen we slept that night sitting up laid on top of the bed on the towels (oh the towels were spotless funny enough) full clothed in coats to keep warm the damp all down one wall was terrible i have returned home with a chest infection after sleeping in that den. Now the highlight THE BATHROOM this was awful ok old you can handle this was filthy the plughole was covered in hair rust mold the paint not just chipped peeling off the bath had been painted white and grey yes I did say the bath it was cracked and jagged we had to put a towel down to stand on to shower. The toilet had been bleached though the seat not cleaned sorry I dont want to see other peoples pubic hair or any other remains. Other people have posted photos I have taken loads and apologies I cannot upload one lady checked in and straight out again as they could not move her a couple were moved 4 times they were there for 5 nights one guy paid $1400 for 3 nights to find remains of a pizza in his bed and when he complained was told if he didn't like it move on I will my two sisters complained after no joy I had the travel company move us i was lucky as i put a lot of business through them some people may not be my sister cried when she saw a couple with small children and a baby trying to move they had been bitten by flees or bugs. We had to stay there 1 night we found a local shop and bought cleaning stuff just so we could try and feel comfortable whilst we were stuck there and did the best we could this was not just 3 sisters moaning other guests stuck there did the same. I DO NOT KNOW WHY THIS HOTEL IS STILL OPEN THESE PEOPLE COMPLAINING ARE NOT A BUNCH OF WHINGERS OR OCD CLEANING FREAKS THIS HOTEL SHOULD BE CLOSED DOWN STRIPPED OUT SCRUBBED AND HAVE A MAJOR REFURBISH THE ROOM IS LIKE SOMETHING YOU WOULD SEE IN A FILM USUALLY INVOLVING A CHEAP FLITHY ROOM THAT WOLD BE USED FOR ILLICIT LIAISONS OH AND THE TAXI DRIVERS FIGHTING OUTSIDE PHYSICALLY PUNCHING EACH OTHER AND IN THE LOBBY WE ACTUALLY FELT UNSAFE. MAKE UP YOUR OWN MIND HOWEVER GENERALLY IT COSTS THE SAME AS ANY OTHER HOTEL SHOP AROUND THE AFFINIA 2 DOORS DOWN WAS SUPERB AND SPOTLESS THE NOVOTEL AT TIME SQUARE AND THE HOLIDAY INN ARE LOVELY.,eva h
UR103785895,2011-12-April,This hotel should be condemned!!!! This place is old dirty filthy and a health hazard!!! The rooms are small and extremely filthy!!!! One person found a pool of blood on the floor when he checked into his room!!! I was amazed that this place could be open and allowing people to stay here!!! The carpet was filthy the walls and doors were dirty and the bathroom was totally disgusting!!! NOT WORTH THE MONEY!!! A TRUE HORROR HOTEL!!! I will never stay here again!!!!!!!!,spounds
UR120480632,2011-11-November,I needed a place to stay for one night just to sleep. I looked at all the reviews good and bad and understood that it was an old place and figured we would take it as it was. We had to stand online for over 20 minutes just to check in. We went up to our room and felt like we were in a horror movie walkign off the elevator. The hallway looked creepy and very un welcoming. We got into our room and it was very dim and there were marks all over the walls. The bathroom light flickered on and was no better. It seemed like it hasn't been updated since it opened. The bathroom door could barely close also and the handle was falling off. The heat and ac did not work since we woke up with the room being ridiculously hot. The bed was so uncomfortable and had a sore back from it. The cleanign lady tried getting in our room around 9:15 am which check out is 12 so there is no reason why they should have been trying to get in. I also found a pair of dusty glasses under the desk which did not belong to my boyfriend or me so it shows how much they don't clean. Would not stay at this hotel again.,Krissy M
UR121610340,2011-11-December,I have travelled around the world and stayed in more hotels than I could possibly count. Many many many cost significantly less than this hotel. Absolutely none approached the absolutely awful conditions of this hotel. We had black mold in the room and the bathroom was so disgusting I was afraid to touch fixtures/walk without socks on the floor. The bedding was disgusting and filth in the bathroom made me use wash cloths to touch everything. A colleague from Austria said "the room was fine as long as you didn't touch anything. Sirens all night outside as well. This hotel survives because there are suckers born every day....absolutely no one who has ever stayed in the hotel once would ever return again. ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING. Filthy smelly disgusting and totally ruined my experience of NYC.,Tracy A
UR103652884,2011-11-April,its not so near from times square so dont get fooled with location map huge hotel  all choas around. it take one hour for check in rooms are old with all old furniture. no service in roosm at all small bed and tv. broken bathroom with old taps  shower dont work times square is minimum 20 min walk from their no free wifi  everything is charged hotel is not worth more than 50 usd a day,Horizon080
UR117919802,2011-10-September,I stayed in this hotel during the Hurricane Irene period. Can you imagine they charged me ~US$20 per minute for making international calls back home to India and Singapore. They are cheats. Will never ever go back to this hotel.,piyushkh
UR120428309,2011-10-November,I went on a short 5 day trip with some friends and we booked the Penn as it had a central location (although went back 3 months later and stayed at Hilton a few blocks away). The lobby of the Hotel is probably the nicest part of it. The room's were outdated infact only one of our lamps worked so it got pretty dark in there. The beds were very uncomfortable and the bathroom was a state. Personally I think it needs a complete rennovation - I would be happy to may more for better quality!,Jayden S
UR92431085,2011-10-January,This place was just AWFUL. The lobby looked fine- like an older hotel but the rooms & hotel interior looked like a crime scene. I really expected to find blood stains & chalk outlines in our "suite". The hallways were FILTHY & the carpet had huge stains on it- which looked like they had just had bottles of bleach poured on them to deal with any mystery DNA on the rug. The room we had was a "suite"- which contained two double sized beds & was the size of any other average hotel room- not a suite by any definition. We got to the room & tried to get booked into another hotel- this place was awful & I was concerned for both safety & hygiene. We had to prop the window open with a water bottle as it would not stay up on its own- the lamp shade had MASSIVE burns on it- which came from either a cigar or a crack pipe- I'm guessing the guests of this establishment are more inclined to have crack pipes on them not cigars. The lamps & TV did not seem to turn on or off on their own- the trick was to plug them in- and unplug them in when you wanted them on. We did not shower in the room- socks were worn at all times- we slept fully dressed. This place looked NOTHING like the rooms on their website. The only positive was that we were only here for one night. That said I'm willing to pay 3 times more & be in a less convenient location to avoid staying at the Pennsylvania. It was really just disgusting- it felt like a crystal palace or a shooting gallery- but NOT a hotel that people without a serious meth habit.,Madubil
UR118828546,2011-1-October,I walked into the lobby and was excited. The lobby is clean large and fancy. As soon as the elevators opened to my floor I could not believe this was the same hotel. Extremely run down filthy torn up and I worried about bed bugs (thankfully there were none.) Our climate control in the room did not work. There was no screen on the windows so make friends with the birdies. Our view was a brick wall. There was dust so deep behind our beds that I spent most of the time in the room blowing my nose from allergy problems. The bathtub would back up and you would be standing in a foot or more of gross water. Towels were never exchanged. Prison toilet. No ventilation in the bathroom so after a shower you nearly die to get out of there. Nothing has been remodeled it looks like.... ever. Terrible sleep. Terrible beds. Terrible noise. I would be okay dealing with all these things if I were playing $40 a night but I was paying more like $250. Ouch. The only thing is place has going for it is the location. Very close to timesquare and all other exciting things in the area. That is about it. I would never ever stay here again. Ever.,deardementia
UR106379941,2011-1-May,I don't normally write reviews but thought it was important to do so for the hotel. The lobby looks not bad but the room was terrible. The carpet is old brown carpet from the 70's. I didn't take my shoes off it looked so dirty. The bathroom was scary stained tub and not clean. The bed was similar to a pop up camping bed. I was not good. We moved the next morning to another hotel so we could shower and feel clean again.,SJW1000
UR98588867,2011-1-March,If you've already made a reservation I warn you don't read these reviews. I went on the trip with my Uni and like everyone else I must say the lobby is very quite deceiving. Upon receiving keys to our first room we made our way up the elevator and to the 14th floor. After walking down about three different halls we came to our designated door opened it and the first thing we saw were scuffs on the wall and peeling paint. We went deeper into the room to find that none of the three beds were made a dusty old mirror had broken and was being propped up by the foot of one bed the heater was set to a boiling temperature dust was floating all around and last but not least the bathroom had a dirty towel with a black stain no less and a broken shower. Needless to say we went right back downstairs to change rooms and as another triple room wasn't available even after the three hours it took for them to allot the one they had promised we were given a room with two double beds. I have to stay this room was a steady improvement upon the first but the bathroom was still in need of maintenance there was a bit of mould and dirt on the curtains and the fridge in the corner also had mould growing inside of it. My biggest issue with the hotel was the staff. Of all the employees that dealt with our situation only ONE was nice enough to at least try and make us feel comfortable and show some respect. Unfortunately by this time and after a 6 hour flight and another 1 hour drive my attitude was sky high. The staff have no manners and showed no respect to any of us talking down to us or at us. If it wasn't for the fact that I was with a large group I would've left this hotel in a minute. It has an excellent location directly across from madison square garden underground is right across the street deli's and cafe's in close distance and probably about 6 blocks from times square. That's it's only saving grace!,tweetypiebabe1
UR121282980,2011-1-December,If it's your first time in New York I advise you to look for a hotel near the Times Square where everything happens. This was the main reason why we've chosen Pennsylvania. The hotel is located in front of (literaly!) Penn Station on the 7th Av. and 10 minutes walking distance from some of the main spots. Regarding the hotel service if you are looking for a pleasant place with a nice service and a neat and comfortable room... forget Pennsylvania! We've paid a little more for a room "Penn 5000" with breakfast included thinking that we would have a bigger room but I can tell you that the only thing big in there was the furniture! Furthermore the breakfast room was a standard room size for what it seemed to me a all floor with only 4 tables... Hotels are expensive in New York but I can guarantee you that this is not a "great value" for its service only for its location!,Rititi
UR63591825,2010-8-May,We had read a lot of terrible reviews beforehand and were kind of afraid... but in the end it wasn't as bad as we expected. You basically get what you pay for: a very basic two-star hotel whose biggest plus-side is it's very central location in between Madison Sq Garden and the Empire State. The room was okay-ish. It was a bit dusty but calling it dirty would go too far. I do think we were in one of the refurbished rooms -- apparantly some other rooms are really bad. The worst was the reception: always very long cues not very helpful staff and you need too pay quite a lot extra to leave your suitcases the last day. We didn't have breakfast in the hotel but went to a great breakfast restaurant just around the block every day.,R_Vosters
UR58095106,2010-8-March,Don't expect service the hotel is in a good location but that is about it - the bathroom vents had so much dust so no air was getting in or out - a real health hazzard. from a traveller New South Wales Australia,downunder007
UR70179610,2010-8-July,Absolutely horrific one hour wait for check in. The staff were rude and inconsiderate and took above 10 minutes to process each party. When we got to our floor we were unable to locate the room and the aimless wandering was made no better by the foul moldy odor emitting from the carpets. When we eventually did locate our room the key would not work nor would the janitor's. When we eventually did get into the room we took one look inhaled the smell noticed the abysmal state of the bathroom and ran out of there. Only plus side; the manager accepted our cancellation without charge. A regular occurrence perhaps?,milo6456
UR52976797,2010-8-January,I'm a member of an air crew who recently HAD to stay at this DUMP!! I totally appreciate that it is 'historic' place BUT: I had 'spit out' chewing gum used makeup remover pads candy wrappers and other garbage under the bed. There was a 'left over' Coke bottle left in the refrigerator - someone else's garbage! The walls are FILTHY in the rooms. They look like someone threw glassfulls of swampwater against the walls. The bathroom had enough hair in it for me to knit another person. The door is probably the original from 1919 - which is when this place was built. (It's the possessor of the "Pennsylvania 6-5000" telephone number that was made famous in a song played by Tommy Dorsey and other Big Bands). EVERYTHING in the rooms is covered with filth. It has a reputation for spreading Bed Bugs! I didn't have any 'bug' problems but I would URGE EVERYONE with ANY sense of Hygiend to AVOID this horrible place! The heat - when you can get it - is either non-existant or the same as being in a Bessemer Blast Furnace. If you call for assistance you'll get several different excuses as to when someone will be there to fix it or you'll get no response at all. If you're used to the surroundings of a dumpster stay here. Location is great and the Lobby is VERY DECEIVING. (It looks like something from the movies - the 1940's movies) As an aircrew member I've seen several DISGUSTING places all over the world. THIS place is #2 on my list of NASTY! STAY AWAY unless you plan to disinfect the entire room (including the bathroom) on your own! HORRIBLE DISGUSTING FILTHY UGLY and any other word that means GARBAGE!!,usblueflyer
UR60749252,2010-8-April,Thus far in my 34 years of life I have yet to stay in a hotel as disgusting and unsanitary as the Hotel Pennsylvania !! They should change the name to the flop house motel .. Dirty  loud  crazy people running the halls day and night ! The rooms were dirty  the beds made noise and were not stable  the sheets had stains and so did the bathroom walls ! The toilet was filthy and had been left without flushing and the tile in the shower was coming up all over the floor !! Thank God we only had one night here but we changed rooms 3 times and they were all disgraceful !!,Grkmellie
UR82388012,2010-7-October,I absolutely HATED this hotel! It was a long wait to check in and when I did get to my floor it was HORRIBLE. I Absolutely hated it. It was like the elevator doors opened to the projects. The paint was chipping away the wallpaper was hanging off the wall the hallway was dark and dingy. I swore I was gonna get mugged! There was bleach stains on the carpets. But it gets better when I enter my room. The room was entirely outdated and grossly filthy. The bed had a sink hole in the middle and the bedding was soiled. After moving from room to room we settled in a room where we had to buy socks to walk around. Luckily we ran into a cleaning lady where she gave us practically all her clean linen off her cart. We made runners out of the towels to walk on. We made sleeping bags out of the sheets she gave us and slept on top of the made up bed linens. We lined the shower floors with the extra bath towels. And we used bottled water to brush our teeth. To sum it up ...... this place is Nasty and disgusting! And the staff actually has the nerve to have an attitude as if we were in a 5 star hotel.,brunetteshair
UR86307183,2010-7-November,I recently stayed in this hotel from Wed 3rd November to Sat 6th November 2010. As my stay was just before the Marathon the rates were a complete rip off for what was offered. This hotel is a dump I booked into the Penn 5000 rooms which claim to be "A hotel within a hotel" with seperate check in - The special check in was not available nor was the Penn 5000 room staffed at any time. The staff at check in were laughing and joking with co-workers in foreign language while serving you - I'm all for enjoying your work but this took it to the extreme. This may explain the issues she had with trying to find my reservation in spite of the fact I handed her the number (which she paid no attention to) I am not expecting a large room in NY but the room was small. When you walked in first there is a stale smell in the room and to say the walls are flithly is an understatement. The bed was so small you could just about fit one adult never mind two. There was only one bedside locker for a double room with two people. The TV was un adjustable and at an angle you could not see it. The A/C did not work properly and I dread to think what the scratching noises I heard were. I did leave a complaint at the front desk but not no response. I finally sent an e-mail to the mail contact while still there asking if anyone was going to bother to respond and deal with my issues. I was not moved rooms but I was however given a complimentary night stay. The only good thing about this hotel is its location right across from Penn Station. Easy access to the airports. All in all $274 a night plus tax - A total rip off.. you might as well just bend over..,Scoopy_1
UR63500881,2010-7-May,I'll bullet point this; AREA - hobos dealers and hoodlims. NOISY QUEUE to check in - over and hour STAFF RUDE walking away when asked a question putting down the phone on people. Swear to god I heard one receptionist charge some foreigners a higher for a room - what cheats.. ROOM: the most rancid disgusting level of hell you could imagine. Cigarette butts on the foot bits of food even! Even FRESH cigarette butts found (from cleaners i expect?) workmen drilling into our wall outside our widow looking in without any warning dark crammed. Smelly sink came off wall and nearly fell on us bath had big black stains on it lights made a hum that drilled into your head. TV remote didn't work TV didn't even work with more fuzz than picture. EXTRAS?: they even charge you if you make a FREE call!! How crazy is this?! We couldn't even phone our airline without being charged. Internet? NO! It's all paid for with your credit card by the minute. (free internet was in McDonalds next door). Ridiculous prices. TO TOP IT OFF: ....BEDBUGS! I had to sleep with my clothes on as I kept getting bitten. Yes that's right and there are plenty of other posts and pictures proving this. I expect the lovely people hanging outside the hotel bring in their homeless crack lady's who haven't washed to sleep in this bed. If I saw a gun imprint in the bed I wouldnt be surprised. I was lucky enough to have a fridge with DUST in the fridge. How the hell does dust survive in a fridge? By God's eyes it was there though. Only in Hotel Penn. PROOF?: i've uploaded videos and pictures. The hotel is so DARK because they want to hide the dust and cobwebs the rust the bits of food on the floor the creepy crawly's crawling into your ears at night. Every day when we saw sunlight we rubbed our eyes outside the hotel and you could see people do this! It was quite funny. I don't care how cheap you can get this for I don't care if you're just using this for a place to stay whilst you are shopping - I SLEPT AT THE AIRPORT AND IT WAS FAR BETTER! Yes a hard floor lights and the airport was so much better (and cheaper) than staying at this rancid place that should be turned into something more useful like a rock or a water fountain. Stranded from volcanic Ash the mayor of NY requested all hotels lower the prices for those stranded. Did this hotel? No. I wouldn't stay here if the hotel paid me. Every night When i swatted myself fully clothed i shivered with the thought i was in this godforsaken place and wondered why the world is so cruel that this place exists on earth. Sleeping felt like like lying in a pool of vomit in the dark with screaming kids and drilling being playing in the background. I don't even have the words to describe the experience of staying here. Tom Hanks in cast away I'm sure would rather stay on his little island stranded if he saw what i saw. There you go no words can describe the horror of this place. It's been a few weeks on and I still have to wash out my eyes with bleach just to get the nightmareish images out of my head. The ripp of merchants of this place took our money and gave us only what the apocalypse could bring. Bless you all if you stay here or if you are you are surely being punished by a higher being or possibly you have committed terrible crimes in a previous life which brings me to my final line - I wish i had so many unpaid parking tickets they put me in a cell which would have been a luxurious break compared to this hole in the ground.,Mashmellows
UR74179519,2010-7-August,It is very out of character for me to book a hotel without thoroughly investigating it- but I found myself on a train into the city for the evening...desperate for accommodations. I found a room available at this place on Expedia and booked it. From the moment I walked up to it to find a homeless person urinating against the outside wall- to the 1 hour waiting line to check in- to the lobby filled with what seemed like hundreds of foreign student backpackers draped everywhere this so called "hotel" was frightening!!!. I tried to find anyone in charge just to see if I could cancel my reservation and it was literally impossible. The hotel is antiquated dirty and creepy. If it was empty- you could walk in and easily think it was an abandoned building it is that neglected. I was so disgusted I walked out and checked into another hotel. There are soooooo many places in NYC to stay. Do not waste a MOMENT thinking of staying here. I would have been better off sleeping on the train I booked this reservation from.,momofsclg
UR82302964,2010-6-October,From the first impression to the last Hotel Pennsylvania was horrible. The doors entering the hotel were greasy & smeared with dirt plus the lobby was dark and filthy. The first "customer service rep" I spoke with was rude and just dismissed me by calling the next customer up while I was in midsentence! I would have left and found another hotel but my friend had prepaid for the room so we stuck it out. We got up to our room and it only got worse. The room was actually a bit larger than other rooms I have seen in NYC but that didn't make up for the fact that it was disgusting. I didn't want to shower or walk around barefoot and setting things on top of the bed cover made me shudder. The carpet was dirty there were hairs in the bathroom (on the floor sink and even found one on a towel) and the bed linens looked dingy. Plus the entire room was old outdated and ugly. The room was too hot & stuffy but we couldn't control the air conditioning or even open the windows because were no screens on them! Also the bed was worse than sleeping on the floor. It was like sleeping on a cardboard piece with a thin blanket. AWFUL!!! The ONLY thing this hotel has going for it is the location. It's right across the street from Madison Square Garden so if you just need a place to stay near there and don't care one bit about the state of the hotel go for it... But still there are plenty of other options within a few blocks that must be better than this!! The next night I stayed at a different hotel that was $195 per night for a queen room that was perfectly lovely (check it out - Hotel New Yorker)... MUCH better than $220 per night for the one double bed in a gross room at Hotel Pennsylvania.,girllovesworld
UR66618834,2010-6-June,Anyone who reviews this hotel and says "Eh its not that bad" is either a homeless person or someone who is comfortable not changing clothes for a month. Simply disgusting. The room smelled like urine. The beds were disgusting looking. The floor which was an old worn-down carpet felt damp. Two of the electric sockets including the one in the bathroom didn't work. The only ice machine that worked was 6 floors away...yes I walked down six flights and checked 6 different machines before i found one working. No ice buckets in room. Suffice to say we arrived at 8:30 PM dropped our bags off and went out for the night came home at 2:30 am and looked at our disgusting room again and decided to leave instead of sleeping in those revolting beds. And just so you know I can stay just about anywhere. Basically lived in a closet sized apartment for 2 years during college where the bathroom was down the hall. I don't expect much from hotels normally because i just want a place to crash. I'd never crash here even if I was roofied.,MDW44
UR74103667,2010-6-August,When we arrived at the hotel we had found that our reservation had been canceled due to the 1800Hotels.com bankruptcy. They were then extremely uncooperative in dealing with the situation. Eventually I paid for a room at a price exceeding the price I had booked for. Saying the room was shabby would be giving it a complement. Upon leaving I asked if they were renovating the rooms. I was told the room had already been renovated.,FormerNYer_CJ
UR60499972,2010-6-April,This is the worst place I have ever seen! Small discusting rooms with old small beds that must never have been replaced in the last century. The bathroom was small and the outlets were cracked and barely held up on the wall. The walls were dirty not even a paint job could help this room. The a/c unit didnt turn on to circulate air and the windows didn't open. The rooms and hallways were dark and scary. I took my teenage daughter and got the hell out of there!! Never stay here if your looking for a decent bed bathroom lighting security peace of mind or a nice trip! The pictures online for this Hotel are nothing like what you will be getting. This place is a rat hole!!!,freespiritFlorida
UR78325283,2010-5-September,If the Democratic or Republican for that matter National Convention is in New York and the city is completely and totally full then you should consider booking the Pennsylvania. This monster of a hotel to big to understand obviously service is what you pay for. But staying cheap can be to expensive.... waited 1 hour and 25 min. to check into hotel lobby is poorly lit and very dingy would ahve felt unsafe had it not been for the 400 other people waiting in line to check in. Are we really so plentyfull? the cheap ones i mean the ones who will sacrifice 1 hour and 25 minuts of our lives to save 50$ on a real hotel.....makes you wonder.... rooms are absolutely horrible dirty smelly and very unpleasent. No curtains tiles falling down in the bathroom toilet seat loose. All in all the only reason to stay here is not to spend any time at the hotel... those savings came at a big price. Never again absolutely never again,uk2dubai
UR82249766,2010-5-October,I'm always trying different Hotels in NYC and have never had to write a review like the following... I stayed here with some colleagues on the weekend of Oct 1st. We had 3 rooms. Let me start by giving you a fair Warning...Stay somewhere else!! This is THE WORST Hotel I've stayed in...EVER! The service is non-existant. I honestly believe everyone that works here Does Not Care. The Rooms were a mess at check in (and I mean a MESS) and no one wanted to do a thing about it. The hallways are dim and dingy. The rooms felt like the projects and I Know Projects! This is a Glorified Housing Project. The Lobby fools you with the dozen Flat Screen TVs and Lounge but the adventure starts in their dirty elevators and continues through the "Shining-like" hallways. Even the coffin-shaped doors to the rooms are filthy and painted a depressing olive green and white over non-sanded patches. The rooms have MOLD are horrendously out-dated the linen is unapproachable and the rugs are musty. The staff is arrogant and cold. There is no upkeep in this hotel. The Board of Health should be notified. The only thing that the Hotel has going for it is the location. It's directly across the street from Madison Square Garden and Macy's and is in close proximity to the Empire State Bldg and Times Square. But heed my Warning... STAY Elsewhere!!! This could possibly be The Source of the Bed Bug Epidemic! Pay the extra 50 to stay Anywhere Else it'll be worth your peace of mind and a good night's sleep.,StarSync
UR86080362,2010-5-November,A freind and I planned a trip to Ny for the first time on Halloween weekend 2010. We arrived at Hotel Pennsylvania Oct 30 around 4 am. Due to the fact that I had performed extensive research on the hotel I had decided to refuse to stay in any rooms or floors that had bad reviews about bed bugs. We were issued a room on the 3rd floor (323A) and as soon as I opened the door I was repulsed by the stained rug and chipping paint on ALL walls. Since it was so late at night I decided to enter the room anyways and see how bad it really was. Unsuprisingly it got worse there were black hand prints on the walls and curtains and the bathroom looked like a crime scene. While I was going to find an alternative I tried to turn on the air and yea you guessed it it didnt work. When I called the front desk for assistance the lady stated "you need to turn it to the right and if not to the left" when I told her that i tired both she told me I needed to read the print on the AC unit and that wouldve been great if it hadnt all been scratched off. I've gone from really bad to great in my life and this hotel is by far the worse room / hotel ive ever seen. I GIVE THIS HOTEL NEGATIVE 45 STARS. My friend swore the hotel is haunted as well. I wouldnt recommend this LOW CLASS MOTEL to anyone. In addition both her and I are still traumatized.,DeSiReEMiami_Florida
UR55232083,2010-5-February,The entrance lobby looked very eloquent but when arriving at the room the floors walls ceilings and bathroom were all quite dirty.,TravisL3
UR89088865,2010-5-December,We have just returned back from a family trip to New York and we booked the holiday back in June for myself and my partner and our 2 grown up children. Upon arrival we thought the hotel looked very classy with a very handsome lobby. we were dealt with very expediently by a very pleasant receptionist who gave us our keys to our room on the 14th floor. This room was horrendous- peeling paint in the bathrooomdusty tops and a very dangerous light switch and very very old furniture.I marched down to reception to complain and was immediately given another room on the 12th floor which we inspected prior to moving our luggage. This was just as bad with a very shabby looking bathroom and grubby furniture and carpets suffice to say we didnt move our luggage.My wife then went down to reception and was again given another room key on the 8th floor which after inspection was much better than the previous two. The rooms are very basic with only an old fashioned TV and radio and with very minimal facilities however at least this room had been refurbished. In my view the whole place needs a serious refurbishment and it is a crying shame that such a handsome looking building has such a grubby interior.The location despite all the downsides is superb and is walking distance to Times squareBroadway and 42nd street and smack facing Madison square garden.My advice to the owners would be to get this place refurbished as soon as possible as it has the potential to be one of New York's finest hotels. Sadly at the moment it is a long way from that which which is a real shame.,Benalcol
UR82098335,2010-4-October,This was the worst Hotel I have ever stayed in. It should be a Motel not a Hotel. Rooms are disgusting theres mold in the rooms smells bad towels were yellowish staff and manager (Jonathan) were horrible. I should of beleived the reviews. NEVER EVER AGAIN!!!! The Board of Heath should shut them down!!!,boston978
UR85964344,2010-4-November,I like so many others stayed and I read the reviews. But I really like the Location. The Desk guy was very helpful but hte room was run down  I had a roach in the shower that was so big I could have rode it down 7th Ave!  No Heat in the room  No towels & when I asked the maid the next morning for some she acted like I was stealing them! No hot water and I was just a poor excuse of a Hotel.....and this place was busy!! they will not fix this problem if people continue to book this place! I stood out side and watched the doorman only take cabs that would had him money!! Only in NY.. you gotta love it,TroyDunbar1
UR57694531,2010-4-March,I was spending 24 hours in New York following a conference in New Haven and though I had been warned by the other reviews I had read here about this hotel i was in a 30 minute queue to check in and found this to be so fustrating and unacceptable because they have a huge check-in desk but never more than one person on it at a time though there appear to be loads of staff loitering around. They even have barriers to manage the queue like at the airport! when I finally did check in the one staff on duty was efficient (so to speak -how long does it take to check someone in?) and was able to find me a room even though it was not check in time but he was not very friendly I felt I had to really push him to give me a room. I have stayed in hotels the world over I am a student so always choose the cheapest hotels i can find and i know what you get for your money -i have been to NYC before so know that for $80 you can get a rather dire room and I was prepared for all of that however I was not prepared to be repeatedly told i had to wait to pay that i couldnt pay yet that i had to come back in the morning to pay etc etc -having seen the speed of service at check in I was not eager to embroil myself in that at check out so once more i had to insist that they take my money which is an annoying thing to do when you basically have no time and do not want to spend it in a hotel lobby. The room once i got it was fine completely as you would expect for such a price. for the room alone i would stay again but because of the rudeness of the staff i think i will pass. It is very central and can be very cheapif you get a good rate and now you know why. On my next trip to New York I will probably not spend any more money but choose somewhere less central. I have stayed in much better hotels if further away before. Stay here only if you REALLY dont mine the incompetency of their systems.,LostTravellator
UR60371249,2010-4-April,All these reviews are right this place is all about location. Be prepared when you go in to be deceived by the lobby. As soon as you get off the elevator you know you made a bad decision. Welcome to a scene from The Shinning. As you proceed down the hallway you'll pass door after door that look like coffins. The room instantly smelled like urine and the cigarette burned comforter was nasty. We took it off the bed immediately. The rooms are small and noisy. You can easily hear your neighbors. On the flip side the staff was nice and friendly. Note: we did not stay in a renovated review.,NYCtravel10
UR91169959,2010-31-December,My daughter and I stayed at this hotel in October. The location is excellent - I will give it that. The lobby is beautiful but wait until you get to your room. I am used to staying at Motel 6 and Super 8's so don't expect a lot of bells and whistles. I do expect a clean secure room. Our first room was a disaster - filthy broken furniture unkept beds and the window wouldn't close any farther than 12 inches. We requested a different room. Our "upgrade" was slightly better - atleast the window was closed. Our beds did not have mattress covers the sheets did not go the full length of the bed (short about 14 inches) the bathroom ceiling was covered with black mold spots the heater cover was completey off and propped up against it the porcelin was peeling from the bath tub with the chips laying in the bottom (probably a full cup of them) and the room was very dated with old broken furniture. We went to the store and bought bleach to clean the surfaces. We didn't shower for two days due to the condition of the bathroom - "spit baths" only. The toilets don't flush well. We really didn't feel safe even though the doors look like submarine doors where they have taken the old doors and welded metal over the glass area. I don't think there was a smoke alarm as I saw a sign when checking out that there were complimentary smoke alarms upon request. Hmmmm ..... It was a good thing we were gone all day and dog tired when we got back in to our room. The taxi's are so reasonably priced that it would be worthwhile to stay at a different location and catch a cab to Time's Square and walk to the different sights from there.,Barb617
UR65784280,2010-30-May,Without doubt the Hotel Pennsylvania is an experience where ones level of expectation and entitlement is SO much higher than the standard of service and most especially accommodation. Rather than any charm from the obvious age lack of attention and investment paid to it the quality and standard of both public areas and rooms is a disgrace to the owners of the hotel and the city in which it is located. Occupying a prime site opposite Penn Station and in a busy part of NYC Hotel Pennsylvania could and should be SO much better but the reality is that it closely resembles 3rd world or old Eastern Europe standards - indeed many hotels I have stayed in in both are significantly better than the Hotel Pennsylvania. With 2 notable exceptions the staff are either low-profile or aggressively rude. Given the choice of accommodation in NYC it's my hope that all potential customers will stay elsewhere and avoid the unsavoury and disappointing experience of 'The World's Most Popular Hotel' ... the Hotel Pennsylvania is just AWFUL !!,bigbeekay
UR59901227,2010-30-March,the worst hotel Icame across so far. all the money have been spent in "the bling bling" lobby. Front desk staff not friendly at all especially if you are a foreigner even if speak good english. Looks like a FACTORY to me...very old dirty and noisy room.... STAY AWAY from the pennsylvania if you've got a minimum of standard !!!,brownsugar97
UR91099113,2010-30-December,I have stayed at and recommended to many the Hotel Pennsylvania in New York City for the primary reason that it is extraordinarily conveniently located for train travellers like me to train into the city walk with my bags directly across the street check in then on checkout day store bags at the hotel do whatever and have a very easy trip in and out of a busy town. I've done this trip now 5 times. In the past the Hotel Pennsylvania has provided a good value even at Christmas time and has had decent if not perfect rooms with good cleanliness good value good service. This trip my first in 4 years there was a marked decline in every aspect of the Hotel's service. The checkin lines normally 8 or 10 people deep were 20 and slower. The bank of 12(!) elevators consistently required waits of 5 to 10 minutes. Coming down 5 or 6 cars would stop completely full before one came with enough room to squeeze on and then would stop at every floor on the way down only to see the desperation on the faces of all the people waiting there for the who-knows-how-many cars it took to find them space. Modern elevator systems can be used to make this better and it's a major hassle when you forego heading down to the street because you're afraid the elevator trip might not be worth it. Our room was on the 11th floor. Our radiator cover fell off every time you got close to it until we jammed a quarter into it to hold it closed. You don't want to see the inside of the radiator at this hotel believe me. The window wasn't shut quite tight so snow was coming into the room. This was obviously not a problem just in our room as plaster was flaking from the ceiling above and water stains on the carpet said the people in 1018 were probably in the same boat. The room appeared not to have been vacuumed except cursorily in the past few weeks. There were odd stains on everything. The desk chair would have been more at home in a crime scene investigation for all the dents stains discolorations and foreign materials it was holding onto. Ask for an extra towel or two to cover this up if you go. There were all of 3 outlets in the room so rather than add a power strip the hotel simply plugged in only those things it could. With no overhead light in the room at all this meant that when you had both lamps plugged in at full blast you had a whopping 80 watts of light in a 10x15 room. Apparently this is part of their redecorating and cleaning strategy if you can't see the crap it might not be there. But with both lights plugged in you couldn't use the cordless phone or an internet connection that both needed to be plugged in to work. You also didn't have anywhere but the bathroom to plug in any phone charger. The bathroom was fine if old. The shower water pressure was appropriate for stripping the varnish off old furniture so any more than a 64th of a turn on either water valve and you were left cringing at the touch of the shower spray. The shower curtain was pretty new and the towels were good. If only we'd had enough to cover the rest of the room with them. The furniture was about a 1980 vintage it appeared and really showing age and wear. Corners were off every piece. Handles were missing on drawers. everything was worn. Beds were screwed to the wall sort of. There was a mini-fridge to store stuff which was nice. There was no free wifi available in the rooms. No plug in Internet unless you unplugged the light or TV. We received a complementary "continental breakfast" with our stay which we initially tried the first day (and went back to verify the second). After a disastrous 10 minute wait to go up from the 11th to the 12th floor on the elevator we wandered around looking for the place. At the lobby they tell you it's in room 1210A. Room 1210 had some surprised asians who did not offer us breakfast. 1210A it turns out is on the other side of the building from 1210. It's also not labeled with any sort of helpful room number. When we entered it was a suite-sized room maybe 15 x 20 filled with about 30 people. Three scattered bar tables were covered with trash. There were no coffee cups and the table that held the 20 gallon tin of orange juice which was giving up its last was covered in napkins and other trash. There was a bin unit that once apparently had bagels bread pastries and the like now had about 12 broken muffins amid a bunch of other trash. The room was dirty overall overcrowded disgusting. The one attendant stood without cleaning and did nothing. We left to go to a restaurant outside. I complained to the front-desk manager the first night about the general cleanliness of the room the continental breakfast and was offered the following compensation: late checkout and a promise that they'd have more food there tomorrow. There were other glitches to the trip since we were there during a snowstorm. Our room was not made up at all after our first night due to a shortage in the maid staff. We called for towels and they brought them. Lines were longer for checkout due to the storm which we would have expected. Until such time as this hotel changes hands and has had a massive refurbishment of the elevator system the rooms and the service staff we will not consider it at any price much less the nearly $300 a night they charge for this great location.,TwoWheelRadio
UR77578311,2010-30-August,I stayed at the hotel for one night. They took my car when I checked in and less than 24 hrs later when I got my car back the front end was smashed in. They claimed it was like that when they got it which it certainly wasn't. The manager dismissed me and could care less. I'm very angry with this Hotel. If anyone ever stays here with a vehicle beware. Maybe they will steal it and say you never had a car.,Crashed86
UR62897173,2010-30-April,We husband and I and couple of friends had spent a fantastic week in New York when we were stranded due to the volcano in Iceland. On Fri. 16 Apr. we were trying using the internet to find a hotel for 3 nights and there was little availability. We clicked to confirm our booking at The Pennsylvania when the site came back to say they had raised the price by 100 US$. profitting from people's desperation! When we arrived at the hotel we queued for at least an hour to check in for our superior non-smoking rooms. On reception there were portable smoke detectors available - that should have warned us. The rooms we were given were on the smoking floor (not as booked). No apology. Trying to find the rooms was not easy as the signing was inadequate and there are so many side corridors. The room doors look like prison cell doors. Once in the room we found that it was disgusting. The sink had two large cracks in it and no plug. The bath was dirty chipped and peeling the carpet was dirty paint was peeling from the walls the TV was ancient with a keyboard in the cabinet whose batteries had rotted. The telephone looked as if it had not been cleaned this century the ceiling had numerous water stains. My husband asked the housekeeper for a sink plug. Four hours later we asked again and a light bulb was brought! Why? I phoned reception and asked to speak to the manager and said that I was not happy with the room and that it was not a superior room. He said that it was and when I said that if it was a superior room I would like to see what an inferior one was like he asked if I did not want a superior one. Yes I did but that was not one. At that point he put the phone down on me. At midnight somebody started vacuuming in the adjoining room - why?! The only good thing about this hotel is the location. Apart from that there is absolutely nothing to recommend it. There are no facilities in the room and the whole place disgusts me. This does not even deserve one star. Keep well away. Are there trading standards/inspectors of hotels in New York?,Lindagreenacre
UR78090448,2010-3-September,Due to the staff''s incompetence we did not get to stay in the hotel. We were informed "Sorry you do not have a booking with us" Then it was "Oh yes you do have a booking but there is a problem with your credit card as we were from Australia and the hotel cann't accept it. So we cancelled and went elsewhere and have now been charged for not turning up. Apparently we have to have a cancellation number. We were not offered this by the staff. They will not reply to our emails now. I have paperwork to prove what happened but as they have their money now they do not care. Would not recommend dealing with them at all.,Zoe045
UR63168044,2010-3-May,This was the worst hotel I have ever been at. The rooms are small and outdated the bathrooms are dirty and small. The walls on the rooms have dirt and grim all over it. We up graded our room which was the Penn 5000 club which gave us a not so better room and continental breakfast which was a bagal and Orange juice. Honestly we got treated better by the homeless guy down the street then they did. Do not stay there unless you want to throw away money.,sideshowbob25
UR57608382,2010-3-March,This is by far the worst hotel I have ever stayed in.. Myself and friend stayed here for 5 days..when we first arrived at our hotel room the first thing to hit us was the smell of damp from the room we actually dropped our bags and headed to the nearest chemist to get an air fresher whilst unpacking we noticed the dingy brown carpets were damp even at that we determined to make the best out of our holiday and put up with the conditions the final straw came when part of the ceiling actually collapsed whilst we were in bed..when we rang reception to complain they asked us to come down to the reception when we explained what had happened we did not even get an apology from the receptionist we were just hadnt another room key there was actually no conversation from the receptionist throughout we were treated like we were bothering them but isnt that their job!!! We were moved to the 11th floor the room still had the same decor but was in a better condition no damp carpets dingy smell or collapsed ceilings!! We travelled from Ireland..throughout the stay I made 4 phonecalls home comprising of a 4 11 10 and 3 minute conservations when we checked out I nearly fainted to find out the charge was over $300 we I objected to this the receptionist was completely rude and kept saying 'its what THEY charge' but did not give me the name of the phone company I was even charged for calls that did not connect..I was charged $24 dollars per call dialled that didnt even connect I had a total of 3 calls like this..I had no other option but to pay there was no room for negotiation with the receiption she was completely abrupt and rude not sympathetic considering my bill for the week was $400 for the room and another $300 for phonecalls complete rip off - when I questioned the rates I was abruptly told the rate are on the phones on the rooms WHICH THEY ARE NOT If I was given a free holiday to stay in this hotel again I WOULD GLADLY DECLINE - NIGHTMARE,Carrie106
UR66344246,2010-3-June,Then this is the hotel for you. It was relatively clean in the broadest definition of the word clean. Not filthy at all but you can tell it's a really really really old hotel. Everything is old in this hotel but the shower was ALWAYS hotter than hot and after a few complaints they fixed the air in our room to be as cold as a morgue:) Basic stuff southerners (like myself) expect in hotel automatically weren't there: wash cloths (had to request); Ice bucket (no such thing) ice didn't work on our floor at all. Go to 8th floor. Nice mattresses???? not so.. Non smoking floor no such thing... Walked through smoke filled hallways off an on during the stay. Like all hotels I never trust the top comforter definitely didn't trust this one. All in all in a pinch I'd stay again. However if I plan to go to city again I'll save more pennies to stay in the city but probably not here.,4kidmom
UR69554946,2010-3-July,Me and my friend were traveling on a tight budget but did not want to stay at a hostel so Hotel Penn was the best for our price range. The best thing about this place is the location it's at the heart of everything! The subway was easily accessible and Penn Station was just next door. It's within walking distances to the Empire State building great shopping and delicious food at Korea Town. If you don't mind walking it's also about a 20 minute walk to Time Square. As my title suggested it was one of the first thing that popped into my mind when I went there. The hotel itself is very old and even though they tried to renovate the lobby to be a bit more modern there was no hiding the cracks in the wall and musky carpet. The decor is very dark and there isn't enough lighting in the halls or in the room. The room itself was small but manageable and even though the bathroom was renovated the bathtub had cracks and pipes were exposed. We didn't feel comfortable taking our shoes off and checked the bed thoroughly before sleeping on it. The most helpful thing the Hotel provided was probably the map they give up with your key card. The staff was not helpful at all with the exception of the pleasant storage boy in the basement which by the way looks like another horror movie set. In fact I think I got more help and smiles from the other patrons of the hotel than from the staff. They were also very slow and there are long check-in lines every day we went by the lobby. Overall since NYC has so much to offer in terms of activities we didn't stay much in the hotel room so it was fine but if you are traveling with a family or like to stay in a comfortable room I would find another hotel.,hellototheworld
UR73652441,2010-3-August,This was terrible. We never even took off our shoes in the room. The bathroom had rush all over it. The a/c was barely working our curtains were falling down and were stained. The mattresses were old and the bedspreads were old. The lobby was very nice but as soon as you got off the elevator you didn't know what hit you. Then they wanted to charge you if you did not give them a 24 hour notice to leave. We paid 267.00 per night and it was horrible. We would leave early and come back as late as we could so we did not have to spend any time there. The location was wonderful and the building was nice. But OMG te rooms were bad. The bathroom in the lobby you had to go downstairs and you were actually afraid for your life. And they were not nice at all. My husband said the mens bathroom was even worst. It looked like bums had been living there toilet seats were raw wood and tile was falling off walls. The first room they put us in the ceiling was falling down. Ths hotel could be a very nice hotel with a little bit of attention and they could spend the money that they spend on all those little maps on key card to upgrade the rooms.,diana1816
UR88565715,2010-29-November,Ok it was Thanksgiving - i.e. very busy and with the location and size of the hotel we were not expecting a particulaly personalised service. However we were not expecting a queue of several dozen people in a long long line to check in (think airport) slowly slowly moving forward because there were only 3 check-in staff working (slowly slowly). This wasn't helped by a reception head / concierge faffing around behind the scenes but not rolling his sleeves up to help out. Upon arrival at the reception desk there was no apology for the delay (which would have been a nice touch) and the service was laconic indifferent and slow. Finally we got to the room (late afternoon) to find that it hadn't been cleaned from the last guests... The hotel is actually very attractive with a large marble lobby a classical somewhat art deco style and enough lifts operating to service the crowds. The room was pokey (par for the course in NY) and tatty. The furniture was circa 1972 (not in an ironic or retro way - ugly stained wood bulky commode and table) the sheets were ripped (but clean) the bedspread was sticky (lovely...) and under no circumstances would I recommend bare feet on the dark brown carpet. Naturally the TV remote control didn't work the mold on the ceiling was unappealing and the bathroom a dingy shade of yellow (possibly a former white in decades past) with fittings that were servicable but unattractive. It was a place to lay your hat (but not a temporary home by any stretch of the imagination). Upon check-out 2 days later we had to face the queue once more in order to buy a 4$ luggage tag for each piece of left luggage for the stock room downstairs (why they couldn't trust the downstairs personnel with this service is beyond me). I left a jacket in the wardrobe (in my hurry to check-out no doubt) but of the jacket there was no longer a sign based on subsequent phone call discussion with the hotel. You do get what you pay for in NY but the hotel didn't come cheap at all - clearly the management just don't care about return bookings - there are enough tourists in line and the location and "iconic" renomm of the hotel keep them coming in. I would be surprised if they get any repeat business - I would rather stay on Penn station's platform 3 than go there again.,TripDrug
UR72892288,2010-29-July,Most visitors to New York will ever know the pedigree this once grand old hotel had. This hotel was one of the original Statler Hotels the prototype for hotels offering consistent levels of standards and service back in the early 1900's. Most guests will think this hotel has very strange doors as they are made of steel and have a bulge on the front of them. These doors were one of Mr. Statler's original inventions known as Serva-doors. There purpose was to open from the outside to allow the hotel valets to return pressed clothing to the guest without disturbing or entering the guest room. But this hotel shows how much the standards of travelers have changed in the past century. The location of the hotel is hard to beat immediately opposite Penn Station which is the heart of Amtrak and commuter trains. Best of all it is easily accessible from all the area's airports via shuttle buses. Getting to this hotel is the most affordable destinations within the City and allows travelers to avoid the high cost of taxis. Considering this hotel has nearly 1500 rooms the hotels lacks a sufficient number of desk agents to handle the waves of customers. I was on line to check-in for nearly twenty minutes at 4:00 PM. The desk agent was fairly personable and being kind and warm to a desk agent makes them much more amenable to special requests. I had not stayed in this hotel for over 30-years and when I told the agent this she said that I would be ugraded since I was a repeat guests and staying just the night. I was impressed with how I was treated at the front desk. When I got to the room all I could think was what kind a room would I have received if I had not been upgraded? There was hardly a trickle of water from cold tap at the sink. I had to plug my computer into the bathroom as the outlet on the desk lamp did not work and there were no other outlerts The kind bed had a mattress that was well past its prime. It was ironic the shower had the same pressure as a car wash yet it took over a minute to try an retrieve a glass of tap water from the sink. I am tall so it was inevitable I would bang my head on the corner of the metal towel shelf protruding from the side wall in the shower. This is one hotel where the more contemporary outward-bent shower curtain rod would help widen the tub area especially since my one should touched the wall and the other stuck to the shower curtain. The bath lines were soft and I was surprised by the range and quality level of the soaps and shampoos in the bathroom. Perhaps this is what they meant by receiving an upgrade. Perhaps the single greatest disappointment as a business travel was the lack of WI-FI in the guest room. If you need this you have to go to the lobby or que up to use the bank of computers in the "business center". Bottom-line this hotel is well suited for tourist just looking to crash while visiting the Big Apple and has all the charm of the dreadful Port Authority Bus Station located several blocks uptown. There is a complete absence of quality and service associated with this once great hotel and it is unfortunate the owners did not keep this hotel current over the decades. Would it have been too much to ask for the faucets work properly? Let the buyer beware...,TraveljohnsonJ
UR54587445,2010-28-January,This hotel is awful! The lobby was full of people crazy and dirty. The halls were filthy and stained. Some room number signs were falling off the wall. My door had lots of holes in it apparently from old locks etc. My room was horrible. The ceiling had black mold growning in places and the paint was falling down. The night stand had something weird sprayed all over it. The doors and walls had major damages like holes dents scrapes stains etc. The toilet had dried urine running down the side and the seat was filthy. The sink looked like it was about to fall over or collapse. The electrical outlet was falling out of place. The desk chair had what looked like a bullet hole in it. I've been warned by out union (airline) to check for bed bugs here!!! Avoid at ALL costs!!!!!,flyboi31
UR81282020,2010-27-September,This New York hotel is the most disgusting time waster experience. If you want to spend over 60 min. wating to get checked in sleep on a bed that does not give any confort of clean and you like unsannitary smells this is the place.,Guhy087
UR88386666,2010-27-November,Rude staff walls and doors havin peelin paint. Walls os thin that when the guest in the next room couhs durin he niht we can hear. Furniture looks like was bought in a yard sale. I am glad I slept or tried to sleep only one niht at the hotel.,sharpmonica
UR65469732,2010-27-May,After 45 minutes waiting in line to check in we were told that Expedia had booked us a room with 2 twin beds not 2 double beds and there were no other rooms available. After some "discussion" and showing them our receipt from Expedia we were given the keys to a room with 2 double beds. We were a spec dubious since our room was on the 13th floor. The keys didn't work. Security brought our new keys to us 1/2 hour later. Then we entered a flithy smelly closet with two double beds. At first we thought we could handle this since it was a one night stay. But the complaints were piling up. Grimy carpet dust all over the furniture smelled like stale smoke cigarette burns in the bedding stuff hanging off the lamp shade no ice bucket no menu for the TV CRUSTY towels and candy wrappers on the floor forgot to mention dirty tub. A lengthy call to Expedia got us a $50 refund and loud complaining got us an upgrade to an extremely large suite that was adequate. It was dusty. One shower's force was a killer but my brother in-law had back pain so that paid off. In the other shower you had to hold the shower handle in your hand. The water temperature would burst to very hot occassionly. This suite did have an ice bucket WOW! Anyway stay away from this place.,Anmayer
UR81093854,2010-26-September,This hotel is NOTHING fancy. It was clean but I wouldn't call it spotless. Old matress and less than desireable furnishings. Outlet in bathroom did not work nor did 2 our of 3 lights in the room itself. My husband booked this hotel. He was going on business and trying to find something cheap. I later decided to tag along so I couldn't complain too much. the lines for check in were terribly long everytime we walked through the lobby. The hotel is in a good location with multiple subways within the block. Seem as though lots of international travelers stay here but that may be anywhere in NYC. Next time I will book the hotel and NOT book this one. If you have already booked don't be too scared. It is livable but would not be my top choice.,lkeh1
UR88257890,2010-26-November,This is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. If you have children and are considering this and looking at other reviews and thinking it can't be that bad well it is. The hotel staff told me that it is going to be closing down and that is why it has not been maintained. We arrived at 10pm and if I had been able to find another hotel I would have. We only stayed in the room till 9am and went to our next hotel where we showered. Don't waste your money on this hotel (dump).,saltyAustralia
UR57193940,2010-26-February,I was suppose to stay in this hotel for one week paying $375 a day. The room was filled with antique furniture the bed was creaking with every move the curtains were weird looking like sommething from the 1940s. The only thing I liked about this hotel was the deep antique tub and that is was across the street from Madison Square Garden. The second day of my stay there was a problem though. I was walking through the hall going for a late nut beer and as I was approaching the elevator a huge rat was crawling against the side of the wall. Then it squeezed underneath the nearest room door. OMG! I was so creeped out. I have NEVER seen a rat before and I NEVER seen a rat that big! I went over to Penn Station had pizza and beer and caught the train on up to Rochester.,KarinS2
UR80968149,2010-25-September,As soon as i stepped in this room i was in shock. I was on the phone calling my travel agent.The first thing that hit me was "This cost us almost 400$ a night"Really??The room was so small with two twin "slabs of concrete" as i like to call them with matching rock hard pillows Dirty dingy sheets.A desk and two kitchen like chairs.The bathroom was very small and very nasty and OMG the view outside the window well it was like something out of CSI New York where at any minute i expected to see a body lying there..The door made me think of a vault or maybe even a coffin lid!! Internet access in the lobby but you have to pay for it.Staff rude and very UNhelpfull.My back and shoulder are still killing me as a result of sleeping on the concerte slab. Added to all this i was on the lookout for bedbugs instead i had ANTS in my bed yep thats right ANTS.Never would i stay here again or recomend it to anyone..Very Disapointed.And at 400$ a night kinda makes me sick to my stomach.Way to over priced... Please go find yourself another place to stay...Robin Stokes.. North Carolina,robin28083
UR68658811,2010-25-June,I have been wanting to stay at this hotel because of its location. I was very disapointed by the state of it. Smelly old with cacking paint and worn out bathrooms. There is nothing to it apart from its location. Even though you only need to sleep there is no feeling of tranquility when you go back to the hotel. The reception look like a Bingo Hall but the staff are friendly. Even though it was clean it is still not right. After seeing the bedroom I was not tempted to have breakfast there. The internet in the lobby is not free most hotels are now offering it free as it is an essential. You can stay at the Holiday Inn express just down the road for the same price range as it is better. Don't be fooled by the flags outside and the location.I will never ever stay there again.,PAULETINO
UR72253706,2010-25-July,Seriously if you can afford not to stay here don't even consider it. I know I know it's comparatively cheap. But everything said about it in the other review is all true. It is truly an awful awful hotel. Dirty smelly noisy long waits to check in the staff don't care if you live or die uncomfortable poky rooms hopelessy outdated. The only two positives are a) the location (but remember you're in New York it's not a huge city most locations will be good) and b) it is cheap (but it certainly isn't good value). So remember if you can afford anything else and you have a shred of self-respect book somewhere else.,kevinthomas
UR65175617,2010-24-May,I read a review from the person from Bristol CT and couldn't have it better! Not only am I also from Bristol CT but had almost same thoughts with the exception of we did get double beds........Walking down the hallway was like walking on the Titanic with the metal doors and the lit numbers on the floor.......the hotel is a great location but check in was a nightmare and they charge you $4 a bag to store them! I have never heard of such a thing......checkout wasn't much better they had a line of peope and only 2 working the desk.....and FYI if you have Valet parking make sure you tell them and hour in advance you need you vehicle or you will pay over fees.....I frequent the city and I would give this hotel a 2 out 10.....My suggestion is pay a little more not to be squeeved out! Oh yea and don't eat at Lindy's for breakfast unless you want to pay $18 for pancakes!,beadwoman21
UR56966941,2010-24-February,Im just back from NYC - do not stay in this hotel. On the first day we walked into our 'superior' room and the most disgusting smell greeted us. We had to go to a chemist and buy an air freshener! Back in the room we notice about 3 square feet of dingy carpet was saturated over by the radiator that never worked (room freezing throughout our stay) and finally the ceiling caved in! A lump fell down and missed my open suitcase by inches and Ive photos of it! I also noticed there was more rust in the bathroom than actual chrome. When we asked to be moved rooms we were told go back down to reception and re-check in. So we had to get dressed pack up out stuff go back down to reception and didnt get an apology or an acknowledgement of what had just happened. The 2nd 'superior' room we moved into was much better on the 11th floor yet the 1st one on the 9th floor was a sh!t heap! The staff were extrememly rude and the only thing that concerns them is getting money off you - I was hugely disappointed and have vowed to NEVER stay here again. I stayed here 5 years ago and it was no problem but this place has seriously gone downhill in every way - rooms staff service etc. Trust me you will be glad you didnt stay here take my advice I learned a very hard and expensive way!,cookie81Ireland
UR90633687,2010-24-December,We arrived by the side enterance our first impression was 'Oh my god' the place stank of cooking and was full of smoke from the takeaway on one side and the restraunt on the other the place looked awful we proceeded to the front desk in the Lobby where our impression changed to one of reliefthe lobby looked lovely with all the christmas lights the staff at the desk were very helpfull (Sheila) was the lady who booked us in and out and on both occassions couldn'y do enough for us. W then proceeded to our room on the 16th floor and had to laugh at the absolute state of the place peeling paint on the walls carpets were old and dirty the green door to our room looked like it was armour plated the corridors looked like something out of the film 'The Shining' we half expected to see a young lad riding his bike REDRUM!!! The rooms were just as bad dirty old and in need of refurbishment the shower was powerfull but the bathroom itself must of been installed when the hotel was built the cleaners changed the towels daily and our bed was changed the first two days but not for the further three days? A word of advice if its somewhere to get your head down for the night then its ok otherwise look elsewhere the place is a mess!!,alison2901
UR80771964,2010-23-September,Stayed here purely to avoid the morning rush hour traffic to Penn Station. Flew in to JFK from Australia via LA. 20+ hrs travelling and arrive to a 2hr wait to check in. Was after 8pm by the time we were checked in and leaving at 6am to get a 7am train to Washington DC. seriously wished we'd waited 3hrs at the airport for the connecting flight had seemed tedious when planning the trip but compared with the reality of Hotel Penn. First room was supposedly on non-smoking floor (per booking request) but seriously stank of smoke as did the whole floor leading to room. Door wouldn't open intitially as lock was jammed then once open would not lock due to jammed lock issue. Tap in bathroom not just dripping running and could not be turned off noisy air con filthy carpets curtains windows and bed linens blown lightbulbs in lamps and overall disgusting. When I called to complain (first time I've ever complained about a room) was told I'd have to go back to reception and ask for another room told us to take our luggage and key back with us. Should have just left but was too tired to deal with finding another hotel so lugged the bags etc down and had to wait nearly 25 mins for the woman who originally checked me to finish with her current "guest" and help me out. She was extremely rude when asked for another room due to issues with the first room. Eventually gave us another room. Better but still pretty revolting noisy and filthy carpets drapes etc. If you do bother to stay make sure it's a really cheap rate if you have to pay regular hotel rates you should stay in a real hotel. Our hotel on return to NY was $10 a night cheaper about 100 times nicer and great location.,welly10187
UR88036768,2010-23-November,Being without an hotel during the marathon week we have been directed there because it seemed to be the only one with some room available. Personnel very unpolite we arrived in the morning before the room was ready and we had to pay for the luggage deposit. The room was horrible smelly and with the carpet all worn out. It would be fine for a 1 star hotel but having paid 300$ (without breakfast) for a room like this... It's incredible how it looks good if you visit their website do not let them fool you!,Sticasale
UR59383541,2010-23-March,stayed in this DUMP 5 nights 'that could be a record' with friends16th-21st of march. i kid you not 4 hours in line to check in. thats after a 10 hour flight. i would safely say the staff never got a training day in their life so rude and totally ignorant its beond words. finally got so called rooms on 3rd floor. i nearly fainted when i looked in. now i stayed in hotels all over the world and put up with all sorts but this place takes the biscuit. its filth every inch of it. i'm sure any american who stayed here is very embarrest. it was my friends first visit to the usa and it was not pleasant to say the least. its to late to send in the leigons of cleaners thats required just tear it down. its not a hotel. i felt cleaner sitting on a bench in central park. as for the safety boxes thats a laugh too you will have a job getting your own money from them because the staff are get this 'to busy'. please guys dont bring your wife or espically kids to this dump. i showered at a friends house in queens every second day. if you like filth and grime you'll fit right in other wise stay in a bin in central park its cleaner i mean that. i love new york city and will be back but not in this dump,bunnyboy46
UR72029627,2010-23-July,The paint was peeling off the walls. Bathroom has mold growing in the tiles and ceilings. The shower head leaked constantly and there was no bathtub. The shower stall was badly rusted. The carpets were dark and filthy. The room was dark and musty. My bed was too low to the ground and the matress was extremly soft and gave me a backache every night!,tbumbrey
UR90528764,2010-23-December,Don't be fooled by the dazzling foyer/lobby. This Hotel could be great but has been run into the ground. There appears to be no attempt at a major refurbishment of even a lick of paint. The brilliant location cannot hide the fact that the building needs serious attention. There were cracks in the bedroom walls wallpaper was peeling the shower room sink was off the wall and dangling by it's legs. The beds and cupboards haven't been moved in months so the floors were filthy. The windows didn't close making the noisy air conditionning/heating redundant. The electrical sockets were alarming to look at or use. The hardworking cleaning staff always did their best to make the room presentable and the bathroom towels were perfection. The Manager of this Hotel needs to seriously consider whether it wants to run a high class hotel or a slum! I won't be booking a room here again.,strooka Posted by an OctopusTravel traveler
UR62261017,2010-23-April,I was one of the unfortunate people stranded in New York with my son and two friends when the Volcano erupted in Iceland. We booked for several nights as we didn't know when we would be leaving. We stayed 1 night and couldn't wait to get out of the place. I first thought I was walking into the ticket office at Central Station no correction Central Station was much nicer. The hotel was old (which I could have lived with) but the room they put us in was awful. The windows were so dirty you couldn't see through them the walls were grubby and in need of a coat of paint the furniture was just a mismatch and the beds were hard The shower was dreadful with missing tiles,ice_dancers
UR56774271,2010-22-February,We stayed at the Hotel Penn as we were entered for the first time at the Westminister dog show. After reading many of the reviews about this hotel I can tell you they are are true. The third floor where were were given a room was creepy and looked liked a asylum as someone else described in another review. The front deck is of no help to anyone they all seem to be zombies is slow motion. I forgot my cell phone in the room and as I am hearing impaired I use it for a alarm. It was located in my pillow case set on vibrate. We called the front desk about an hour after check out and of course there was no phone found in our room. We were told to call the next day again nothing had been found. I don't know why other reviewers suggest this hotel is a good value with crappy rooms. There are other hotels in NYC much cheaper and I bet much nicer.....,Pyrviewsolan
UR53989078,2010-21-January,I was booked into this hotel by my company because of it's location (which is its only positive aspect). There always seemed to be many people in the lobby and at reception but I hardly ever saw anybody on my floor. There where very long dark corridors and I always half expected to see two little girls at the end of one looking back at me as in the movie. The room was big but old and dirty with paint peeling from the ceiling and cracks on the wall. The room had undergone some sort of redecoration because you could see lesser stained areas on the wall where there had previously been paintings or mirrors. The door looked as if someone had tried to get in using a crowbar. When I put on the air-conditioner it made the whole room smell like a fast food joint because of a nearby restaurant. I can safely say it was the worse hotel I have ever stayed in.,ElQuerido
UR56708140,2010-21-February,Paint pealing from the ceiling and walls. Tubs you would NEVER set foot in. Unexplainable stains on the rugs and walls. Filthy restaurant. All I thought about was bed bugs and getting out of there. Um.. nice looking lobby and great location. Don't stay at this hotel. Spend more money and walk!!!!,upterry
UR90420179,2010-21-December,This was supposed to be a "girls weekend" before I have my baby and instead it put the biggest wrench into our vacation. We had an issue with our credit card for incidentals upon arrival (they wanted to run $40 on a card) and couldn't get a hold of my husband I asked if we could just check in pay the hotel room charge in full pay the $40 in cash and have the card info by end of day and they absolutely refused. The check in was at 3pm my girlfriend and I arrived in NY at 6am and had kept ourselves busy by walking around sight seeing in the cold we were very tired by the time we returned especially with me being 7 1/2 months pregnant.!!! I offered to pay them double they refused I offered them whatever they wanted and they said "no" and asked me to stand aside and wait. I asked for the manager who came out and gave me attitude and said that there was nothing she could do and if I went else where we would be denied because we need a credit card. I said "but we just traveled here from Canada where are we going to stay" and she answered "that's not my problem" and then motioned to the clerk to help the next person in line. I refused to leave the front desk and asked what did I need because I wasn't sleeping in the street. She gave me a list of things she would need jumping threw hoops is what she wanted and the only thing missing was that I light myself on fire. I walked over to the seating area and proceeded to call everyone I knew for help. By the time I got a hold of my husband with his credit card information (scanned copies of front and back of cc and of drivers license) that they wanted emailed I was told the manager had left for the day. She left and never said a word to me!! At this point we had been waiting an hour and a half. I asked to speak to whom ever was in charge they made me wait 20min before a man emerged with the same "I'm not going to help you" attitude. I just stood there at the front desk waiting. I told them this was hard on my feet but this fell on deaf ears. They would usher me aside and move on to the next person in line. When we emailed them the info they wanted more when my husband emailed more they said they didn't receive it. I asked to speak to the manager and he just all together stopped coming out from the back (he never stayed at the front desk to help solve this small issue). We were never shown any courtesy manners or respect. We were cast aside ignored and treated badly. We were just so tired and grateful that one person took pity on us at the front desk and helped me until he was finally pulled from the front and made to stop talking to us. We have no idea what we could have done to be treated so badly. The only reason we stayed was because the temperature was freezing all other hotels were booked and I wasn't about to go lugging around my bags in NYC at this hour trying to find somewhere to stay. Just when I was so tired frustrated and about to start crying my husband called me and said he had called the hotel and yelled at the manager to check us in that I've been up for too long and that this isn't good for the baby I'm carrying. I walked over to the front desk for the last time and a young man who wouldn't even look at me signed us in gave me keys and then gave me a receipt and then looked past me to help the next person. No "I'm sorry for the wait" there were no apologies given there were no words exchanged. I felt like I was in the Twilight Zone of the worst hotel experience of my life....and I've traveled! I've done cheap hostels high end luxury hotels in Europe South America Canada different parts of the US and never once in my life has this ever happened. This whole ordeal took almost 4hrs!!!! In the end we ended up having a half hour to get ready and then have to leave for our Broadway show no resting no showering no relaxing before the show as we had planned. It put our whole trip off and we never really recovered from this. I dreadfully regret staying at the Penn and don't recommend it to anyone.,pregnantatthepenn
UR59084994,2010-20-March,So I picked this hotel because it was close to Times Square and across the street from Madison Square Garden and close to Penn Station. When you first walk into the hotel it's very nice and looks fancy but then you go to your room and it's completely different. There was a nightstand and a desk and they were covered in dust. The beds only have flat sheets so if you toss and turn at night the sheets come off the bed oh and there were tears in the sheets and holes in the blanket. I was there for four days and they only vacuumed once and the hair dryer was broken. So yeah..GREAT location but that's about it..,GizemU
UR68075840,2010-20-June,I would never stay in this hotel again. EVER! The rooms are horrible beds are not comfortable and the bathrooms were not good either. The shower felt like it was a fire-truck hose! The towels were small and didn't really dry you up and the door to the room looked scary - like you were being locked up in a safe. The only good thing about it was that it was right across the street from Penn Station and Madison Square Garden but I'm sure there are way better hotels that are also close to these places.,vbravo83
UR71681758,2010-20-July,Hotel Pennsylvania was awful. The check in and check out times took 2 hours each an no matter what time of day there was always a long line and only 1-3 people working the front desk. The website says it is a historic hotel which has been renovated and it is completely untrue. The hotel does not even have a public restroom in the lobby.The hallways and rooms smelled like must the rooms have old dirty brown carpet the walls look like they have never been painted the beds were very small and uncomfortable the bathroom ceiling was full of mold the shower was dirty and the hair dryer even caught on fire. The website said we would receive a free continental breakfast however it failed to mention that this was only true if you were part of the "500 club". We had to pay to check our bags and then we had to bring them down into the creepy basement to drop them off. We tried to complain and were hung up on by the front desk staff and even the manager. They kept telling us to take up our complaints with "Expedia". I would NEVER stay at this hotel again.,Lindsay027
UR81794296,2010-2-October,Not worth your money. Really long lines just to check-in fortunately we were given a room immediately after check-in others still had to wait for theirs. Thanks to the Fil-Am lady at the counter. Our hotel room looks & smells old. The bed was a little too small for both of us and we're just average built..,earthhaven
UR62996588,2010-2-May,This was the worst hotel i have ever stayed in. Even though the check in was quick and the person i was dealing with was very nice i knew i made a mistake choosing this hotel when i saw the hall ways which were dark and dingy. The next thing were the doors which looked like coffins. The walls in the room had cracks the bathroom was ok but whole room had musty smell. The tv was broken no remote called the desk told me someone would be up to help me but 30 minutes later no one came had to go down to main reception desk to ask what happened to my request said someone would be there in a few minutes when they finally showed up they told me i would have to wait till next day to get a remote which to me is unexceptable.finally next day fixed it. Also be aware if you have a cold day and night they have no heat we froze this was in april. they told me it was the spring season so no heat. I could not believ it. The blanket on the bed is so thin never again will i stay there.,irisblue55
UR69487052,2010-2-July,I would strongly recommend against staying in this hotel. I have travelled a lot and slept in all types of hostels boarding houses bed & breakfasts and hotels - this is the worst place I've ever had the misfortune to stay at. The lobby is completely open to the public (overfowing from people just out of Penn Station looking for a place to take a break) the staff is rude check-in takes forever you have to use pre-paid wifi in the lobby (the signal didn't make it to my 3rd floor room). However the most unpleasant part of the stay has to do with the room itself. Windows can not be opened and haven't been washed in years paint is chipped and peeling rusty shower fixtures the dark-brown carpet is scary and there is a strange musty lingering smell that permeates everything. It's worth a visit downstairs to see the safety boxes - if I hadn't been travelling alone I might have seen the humor in it all but one look at the broken safe doors hanging on their hinges made me turn around go back upstairs and hide my computer and passport in a drawer and hope for the best. The highlight of this horroric stay is a walk down the halls. The stained carpet and poor lighting are downright creepy (remember "The Shining"?). There have got to be better places in the city for the money I paid. The location is the ONLY good thiing about it however with the good subway system what's the big deal about being right across the street from Penn Station?,Loli14
UR73453131,2010-2-August,Pictures are certainly deceiving!!!! This was the worst hotel on the planet!! The location was great and even the outside of the building and the lobby were nice but as soon as we stepped off the elevator...hello hostel. No worse than a hostel!! The hallway had a feeling of a mental institution and the floors and walls looked as if it were the murder scene from an episode of CSI NY or SVU!! Talk about scary!! The room was so small we couldn't even unfold the rollaway bed and the bathroom...terrible and tiny!! And the air conditioner was broken- during summertime in NYC!! And to top it all off they charge per bag to store your luggage while most hotels store it complimentary...but not this place! I could go on forever. There are not enough words to describe this place...but "worst place imaginable" definitely sums it up!!,ans02c
UR59020047,2010-19-March,the hotel looked grand from the outside but inside was dropping to bits. rooms n corridors were scuffed old and dirty looking plaster hole 3ft x 2ft on 14th floor rooms were shocking paint coming off the ceilingcracked basin in bathroom and to top it all bath tap came off in my hand. oh and i forgot draught in the room window was stuffed with loo paper my advise dont go there i asked for a upgrade and what i described above was the upgrade!!,groovyma68
UR71544238,2010-19-July,This hotel was sooooo freakin awful that I just HAD to come online to write a review which I never do! Don;t take me worng its in the heart of NYC so very convinient and the price was a steal for us just $98+tax. BUT -- the experience was something to remember making it the worst hotel in the world I've ever stayed in. We waited for an hour to check in which is ok given its busy. then when we got the room first it was very dirty all the bedding on the floor etc. went down changed the room 2nd room was filled with cigarette butts all over. changed it again 3rd room - bedding all on the floor once again - this was after the manager promised its a very nice room. all this happening while my 11 month old waits in the car in 90 degree wather outside after coming back from a 1 week stay at a hospital. you can imagine the agony. anyways the 4th room finally worked with no working tv that they fixed after 3 hours. i was hesitating to lay down on the bed cuz it just didnt seem very clean. the whole floor was very suffocating we could not wait to get out of the room. i am hoping i never need to stay here again.,CoolCrabber2k
UR53884785,2010-19-January,It's old ugly and dirty! Rooms don't have LIGHTS safe refrigerator nothing! They don't have wi-fi (just if you pay A LOT with credicard). At check in you have to give to them your credicard number and they keep it. They don't have breakfast. The rooms are dirty ugly old and REALLY DARK because they just have one lamp no lights! The beds are small! The staff is terrible too they don't even carry your bags. Terrible hotel and it's the same price as Roosevelt and others (a lot better). The ONLY good thing is the location but definitely it's the worst hotel I've ever been in my whole life even hostels are better,patyler
UR75856419,2010-19-August,I have stayed at this hotel several times and each time have either gotton or been upgraded to a decent room. At this hotel decent is used "lightly"! All me and my daughter were expecting was clean linen (had a king bed in which had a half sheet...possibly twin lying crossways of the bed and only covering less than half of the mattress) The bedspread "stunk". and the bathroom was horrible. The sink had cracks in it the old tub had lost much of it's iron coating around the drain. There were no face cloths no pen no paper and missing hardware in the room. The walls were filthy and spots were all over the walls as if someone attempted to "spot paint". If at the very least the room was freshly painted and fresh linen were present it could have been do-able. The bed was extremely hard so do I recommend this hotel "HECK NO'"!! Is there anything positive? Yes the location is awesome!! If you can get a discounted price well under $200 just insist at check in that you recieve a decent room. Afterall there is a certain amount of satisfaction that even the worst hotel owe their guests. If you choose to stay....there are "FEW GOOD ROOMS" you just have to demand one and if you don't get it...DEMAND A REFUND!!! In my case I wasn't able to get anyone on the phone to assist me and after a 14 hr. long drive to the city I was too exhausted to hassel with it. We could not sleep with the bead spread  however used the top sheet and the half sheet to bed down on...Uggg!! The next day I DEMANDED a do-over and received another room at "no charge" however I did incur a $40 per day parking fee. So now you have it!!! IT'S YOUR CHOICE!!!,CChattam
UR64547472,2010-18-May,Facts: took 40 minutes to check in (this place is hugely popular with foreign travelers) the room was miniscule and quite dark you had to find the right spot on the TV remote or you were stuck on one station no bathtub for the shower so the whole room was wet and no room service. The good part is the great location to virtually everything and nice people for the most part (one of the bell people actually yelled at me for not knowing the cross avenue when I asked for directions). If you just want a covenient place to crash it's fine; just don't expect anything more.,ciaobla
UR67850161,2010-18-June,I stayed at Hotel Penn for 1 night because I knew I was working late into the night and didn't want to take a train home at 3AM. I wish I listened to the reviews. My boyfriend and I stayed in the hotel and while we got a wonderful rate the room was just filthy. I could not believe my eyes when I walked in. First of all it was the size of a closet (which did not surprise me) but the bed was so tiny! There was writing on the walls... Paint peeling on the ceiling... dirty shower... hair in the sink... It gave me the creeps just being in there. Walking through the halls I felt like I was in the movie "The Shining." It took me about 30-40 minutes to check in. The staff was very friendly and the lobby is nice. That's pretty much where it ends. Oh and the restaurant that's in the front of the hotel? $18 for a plate of eggs is a bit too much for me and I'm used to NYC prices. Walk to 8th ave and go to the diner there if you end up staying at this hotel! But please don't even bother!!,Delps
UR56435416,2010-18-February,This hotel was part of a trip my wife and I bid on at a charity auction for our local Boys & Girls Club. It was a 2 night stay combined with tickets to see the Rockettes Christmas Spectacular. We arrived at the hotel started getting creeped out by the lack of security as we took the elevator up to our room. The room was just unbelievably gross. People have already described the lack of cleanliness and lack of maintenance. Called down to front desk and was told the hotel was full and there was nothing they could do. I went down to the payphones in the lobby and called Doubletree Guest Suites in Times Square. They were full. I explained that I was a past guest and I needed to be rescued from a disgusting hotel and proceeded to tell them my tale of woe! The clerk said let me see what I can do. She came back on a few moments later and said I was all set and to come on over! I checked out of this flea bag and went over to Doubletree where they gave me a beautiful room at an unbelievably low rate.,Hate2Pay4Parking
UR61815463,2010-18-April,This is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. The staff were terrible the room was filthy and the shower didn't work. The hotel also feels less than secure. Awful experience. I even paid to fly home a day early to avoid another night in this fleapit. If you are visiting NY for a break/holiday staying here will ruin it. There are plenty of better hotels in NY for a similar price.,molliemouse
UR67817647,2010-17-June,What a nightmare. I was forced to stay in this dump for 12 days for a business trip. My finance director prepaid otherwise I wouldn't have made it past check in. In a nutshell my room had blood stains on the carpet the electrical sockets were dangling from a wire the shower head was an exposed pipe The telivision had rabbit ear antenas and did not get any recption and the hotel was absolutely filthy- not to mention the cockroach infestation and the bedbugs. The staff are virtually useless and frankly I feel sorry for them as the 2 hour long line ( literally) is person after person complaining and screaming. The location is convenient although not a particularly fantastic part of NY. Its directly across the street from Madison Square Garden with access to public transport including commuter rails to Long Island and New Jersey. A close proximity to times square- not something I was interested in. However if that's what your into May I suggest ANY OTHER HOTEL IN MIDTOWN!!,johnandjaime

UR64309457,2010-16-May,The staff is nice and responsive to questions but you get what you pay for here. The area is a tourist trap the rooms are tiny and ours smelled like sewer. The "free breakfast" was nothing more than stale bagels and the internet is unreliable. This hotel is not horrible or dirty but you definitely get what you pay for.,elizabethaberk
UR58707235,2010-16-March,We stayed in Hotel Pennsylvania for 4 nights in March. Was standing in check in que for 30 minutes just to meet rude receptionist. Was given twin room on 3rd floor. The room was tiny and there was damp on the wall with small two single beds. Went downstairs to change a room. Was given bigger room but still not up to good standard. Room was cold bathroom needed refurbisment. Doors looked like from prison cells and carpet was dirty. Although we had non smoking room we could smell cigarrets from next room. Hotel is far too big with unfriendly staff. I would never ever stay in this hotel again or recommend this hotel to anyone.,25London
UR75474977,2010-16-August,This hotel is VERY 1940 my bath was 1960's. The Carpet in my room needed to be replaced along time ago but facilites were clean. The fith floor ice machine was broken and I have to travel to the floor above or below to get ice. Lobby is pretty ...staff is welcoming. :),travel_light58
UR87130085,2010-15-November,the most dirty and awful hotel I have never been in. I would never repeat the experience for sure. It is worth to look for an hotel not so close to the center but clean and tidy; even for sleeping. I would never recommended it to anyone.,pichon_10
UR58628795,2010-15-March,This was the second time we stayed there and both nights woken up by loud kids. They know they got you because it is cheap for the city. We waited in line over an hour to check in and they had 2 sometimes 3 people working the desk. There was no New York hustle going on there. The bathroom tub was peeling apart the tub plug fixture hanging.There was a rubber stopper on the edge of the tub just in case you would want to take a bath. Black mold on the ceiling. One of the legs holding up the sink was lying on the floor behind the toilet. The hair dryer did not work and had to call for another one. The mirror was just about hanging on you could see the inside wall. There was the old steam radiator in the bathroom had to be original. It was all rusty and rust stains on the floor beneath it. I'm use to the hotel asking "how was your stay?" not here. They either don't care or don't have time for a long list. We paid $4 to have our bag held after check out so we can still spend the day in the city.That was convienient however when my husband went over to a table to fill out the ticket a worker came by and rudely said he should not be writing there. It was a laminate table you have got to be kidding! As if it was going to make a difference. Let me show you the bathroom. We put up with the appearance you get what you pay for. But I will not be back because you were rude and that has more of a lasting impression on me.,leolabird
UR75356246,2010-15-August,The person who says this is the grimmest hotel ever is right. I checked in today to the Hotel Penn and 45 minutes later checked out - just as soon as I could find another hotel in the city. Not only was the hotel dirty and old fashioned it also felt highly unsafe and I would caution anyone considering staying there. The main things I found were: - the hotel bore absolutely no resemblance to its website - the Hotel Pennsylvannia entrance listed on the website was derelict and boarded up - The interior is not like any hotel I have ever seen and it looked like a mix between a train station and casino entrance. I walked around the block several times before i walked in convinced that this couldn't be the hotel before the sinking sense of dread kicked in and I realised that I wasn't in the wrong place. - There were dodgy intimidating looking people hanging around in the corridors and there are patrolling armed guards which make it feel more like a hotel in Lagos rather than NYC. - My room (the Penn 5000 upgraded room at $50+taxes extra/night) was dirty antiquated and unsafe. If this was a premium room then I dread to think what other horrors I could have walked into. There was a metal door a heating unit that looked as if it was a death trap (NB any reception that has a notice saying 'smoke detectors are available from reception upon request' is highly worrying) and clearly no health or safety checks had been done recently throughout the hotel. The bathroom shower in my room was leaking and couldnt be switched off upon arrival and everything in the room was sticky and dirty including the bed and a rather manky yellow sitting chair. All of the furniture was antiquated and it was certainly not a place I could work in - even in a room with an ethernet cable that formed one of several frayed and dangerous looking cables. When I explained the situation all 3 people I spoke to who worked in the hotel expressed similar concerns and understood my reasons for wishing to check out immediately and receive a full refund. Infact 2 members of staff stated that they 'often had people who were unhappy with their rooms' 'the hotel is 90 years old and most of the rooms should be scrapped and built again they are so bad'. The only plus point I could say is that all of the staff members were very friendly and helpful. They dealt with a difficult situation very well (I couldnt hide my upset at finding myself in this situation) and tried their best to be helpful - I only wish the hotel they are working in wasn't such a hell hole.,BoutiqueBabe76
UR61629673,2010-15-April,It is in a great location but the hotel room itself is horrible. if your there for more than one night that is not the hotel you will want to stay in. The hotel room offers nothing inside except a clock. The window is propped open and doesn't even have a screen on it to keep the bugs out. Bugs were in the room and the paint was chipped off the wall. This hotel needs to be remodeled. In the heart of downtown manhattan i was at lost for WORDS.,trucolors68
UR79517825,2010-14-September,i booked two roms for my wife and family we checked in to room on 8th floor on Monday 6th septemberwent to reception immediately to tell them that no way anyone could live in that roompaint plaster was falling of walls mould grown on walls alsocarpet was a discgrace and bathroom was a health hazard  guy at reception gave us another room on 11th floor which had been "modernised" we went to 14th floor and opened room door to find the room exact same as room on 8th floor it was appallingwe knew it was a two star but realistically the two rooms we saw were barely one star.We returned to reception and asked for an upgrade and we were told we could be upgraded to Penn 5000 for an extra 25 u.s dollars per night per room we opted for this as a last resortthe Penn 5000 lounge gave us free24 hour internet accessbreakfastwe went to room 1129 and to be honest it was lucky to be a two starit had the same peeling paintonly difference was a flat screen tvlarger fridge and a connection for ipod that never workedwe reluctantly unpacked and went ight seeingwhen we came back to room there was a massive cockroach in bathroom crawling on our toothbrushes and toilietriescouldnt sleep for the 1960's air con unit as it was so noisywent to penn 5000 lounge next morning for breakfast and it was a medium size room with a couple trays of pastrysan urn full of orange juiceno tea bagstwo broken coffee machines and no staff member for assistancedespite requests for tea bags nothing was ever donewhen i checked out on Monday 13th Sept 2010 i got a bill in excess of 400 US dollars for upgrade for both roomsi argued the point with them but they were nothing but an arrogant bunch and were only interested in your cash and couldnt care about your stay.please please do not book a stay at this hotel stay well clear if Manhattan had an a***hole this would surely be it.,scotfalconer
UR83442936,2010-14-October,Large hotel in a great location. Cheap compared to others easy walk to Times Square. But... a realy bad feel in the hotel corridors and rooms. The rooms felt dirty and unclean and OLD. If you just want location with absolutely no frills then go ahead.,vikkijg
UR64147135,2010-14-May,The room was small and very careless. The roof have stains and the bathroom was dirty. I have to shower with my flip-flops!!!. DONT STAY IN THIS HOTEL.,Sofiaebox
UR58574423,2010-14-March,The location of this hotel is the only positive thing I can think of. The lobby was nice that's about it for the inside. We arrived during the Westminster Kennel Club dog show across the street at Madison Square Garden my wife and I were one of the lucky ones it took around an hour for us to be checked in others 2 hours plus. There were only 4 clerks on duty but there appeared to be about 6-8 unattended stations this was due to bad planning on the part of management when you are expecting a large number of check-ins you need the staff to take care of the customers. The clerk was friendly but rather stressed. (BTW most of the guests were checking in with their dogs no problem with me they were beautiful well behaved animals and I am a dog person.) As we made our way to the room we walked through long dingy corridors and found our room plaster and paint were peeling in the bathroom the shower didn't work...it did have a bath though. The bed room was also in need of a paint job a little paint can do a lot to freshen up the atmosphere. The bed was ok. When we turned on the heating it made a terrible racket so we left it off. The TV worked but there was no program guide in our room to identify the channels so you had to flip through them all to find ABC CBS etc. The hotel is in desperate need of modernization it has probably been decades since it was last renovated. It's basically a tired old hotel. To top it off it was freezing and snowy in the city can't blame that on the hotel.,LarryLarnaca
UR70892296,2010-14-July,This hotel is a tip could've cried when we got to our room after a hours wait in a queue to check in the bathroom smelt of urine (had got under the flooring) there was a hole in the bath the bath had been painted in what looked like gloss paint! The carpets were sticky and dirty the paintwork was all peelong and had never been rubbed down just painted over and over over the years you could cup your hands and run along the skirting coming up with handfuls of accumulated filth. The Air-Con was hanging off the wall and made a banging sound 24/7 The furniture was from the 1970's the bed was as hard as nails but overall the place was filthy we changed rooms and the second one was just the same. we rung around other hotels but as it was 4th of July week everything was booked so we were stuck!! I always thought the Americans were picky but they did not seem to mind the squalour of this place although it is centrally located close to all sightseeing and attractions I would not recommend it to anyone I'm not posh by any means but this place was squalid you had to wear shoes in the rooms as the floors were sticky don't even look under or behind the beds you'd be sick they smelt horrid damp and of urine the bedlinnen had cigarette burns in it. Dont be fooled by the website pictures the rooms are nothing like it shows when we complaine dthey did not bat an eyelid and told us all the rooms were the same and if we wanted to check out we'd get a full refund off our holiday company you could tell they dealt with these complaints all the time I took 100's of photo's of New York but not one of the interior of this hotel as it was so disgusting and such a let down. I travelled there with my Niece as a surprise for her 16th Birthday and this place was absymal and such a let down to what was supposed to be a great week. I would never stay there again.,tinag1968
UR53494239,2010-14-January,i've been in several hotels and hostels but never seen such a bad hotel. it's dirty ugly and old. We don't recomend it for honey moon or if you like to spend some quality time with your husband/wife. The lavatory was broken and untached from the wall the ar condicioning didn't work and sounds like an air plane turbine. Only one sheet in bed with no blanket garbage in the corredor floor and all guests seems to be homeless. Go to Empire Hotel like I did.,JosefaPortugal
UR75165309,2010-14-August,Have you ever read or seen Stephen king's The Shining? If you have then you'll know what i mean when i say this hotel's corridors remind me of the film...long dark and creepy. They're also extremely dirty and musty-smelling with huge chunks of plaster falling off the wall and just left in the corridors!!. the rooms are no better....dark dusty (they do hoover the rooms - in fact most nights they still seemed to be doing so at 10.30 pm when we arrived back after a day's sightseeing!) but they don't do edges/skirting boards and there was at least a year's worth of dust and grime in our room at edges/corners. The plumbing is out of date and tempermental (the shower was pretty good - although we had no hot water one night) and the wiring the same (everything hanging off the walls) a/c worked (just) but was so full of dirt and grime that i shudder to think what it was chucking out for us to breathe. Paper thin walls meant we were able to hear conversations late at night in adjoining rooms.... Clientele...? Hmmm...reminded me of a youth hostel. On the plus side....staff on the whole were extremely friendly and willing to help (when we complained of our 'room' (hovel!) and were moved to a slightly better one) the room we eventually got was large (two rooms knocked into one i think) and fairly cool (as it was reaching 35 degrees during the day) and the beds fairly comfortable (bedding/towels were laundered but not to my standard!! it was difficult to find a towel that didn't have a stain on it) and the location was amazing. Times Sq. ten mins walk tube just over the road... Would i go back or recommend it to another family?? NO!,fussy015
UR53396470,2010-13-January,Without a doubt the most disgustingly filthiest place I have ever stayed!!!!!!!!! The room had the most uncomfortable king size bed(mattress at least 30yrs old??) that took up the entire room.(since the room was only about 12x12). the "closet" bathroom had globs of mildewed caulk all around the shower that was rusting and chipping away. the toilet leaked from the bottom and the heater had one setting "suffocate" .The carpet was cheap indoor/ outdoor carpet that may have been vaccumed a few years ago.? The walls were in serious need of repair and a fresh coat of paint. they needed to be scraped since there were "things" stuck to the wall. My wife and I woke up the next morning after tossing and turning all night and CHECKED OUT!!!! only after recieving an attitude from the manager?!! The pics on computer and the Lobby are very decieving. GO ELSEWHERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,liazard-king
UR55854566,2010-13-February,Poor service dirty rooms. The only reason to contemplate staying at this hotel is the location. It's close to a range of sites and the railway station.,Wonboyn
UR89774458,2010-13-December,Overpriced even during the holiday season. Asked for sheets for pullout and extra towels (yes they knew there were 3 in the room) at 11:50p.m. Called front desk at 12:30 to inquire and was told to wait a little longer. Finally delivered at 1:30a.m. Brown water came out of the tub faucet. Desperately needs a paint job. Positive is convenience of hotel to subway.,travel4fun20171
UR70663902,2010-12-July,I stayed here five years ago and had lukewarm feelings about the hotel then. For a recent trip I decided to try the Hotel Pennsylvania again because of its location and price. I was sorely disappointed. Where to begin with what was wrong? First there was an HOUR wait just to check in. Once we got to the room the place skidded downhill. The baseboards corners of the carpeted room and air conditioning vent looked like they hadn't been dusted in ten years (dead bugs and caked up dirt). The bedspread (in a non-smoking room) had cigarette burns and the bed was lumpy and uncomfortable. In the bathroom which appeared not to have been updated since 1930 the porcelain on the tub was half flaked away and there was no vent. The beside lamp had a burned out lightbulb and the batteries were missing from the keyboard connected to the television. The seal had broken on the bottom half of the window making the entire thing fogged up and there were random wires sticking out of the wall that looked like a fire waiting to happen. I was awakened at 4am by someone repeatedly attempting to enter with a keycard until I told them through the door they had the wrong room and they moved along. On the upside for me the air conditioning worked and worked well. A couple that got in the elevator with me said they had now been in TWO rooms where it was broken and had just gone out and purchased a fan.,nic_leb
UR63840964,2010-11-May,this is the worst experience i've ever had staying at ANY hotel. the sevice was the worst. when i called for a hair conditioner the response was "we don't serve that on the tenth floor" hahah besides us paying 300 dollars for a freaking room. it took over an hour to check in and when it was my turn they were extremely rude. i've never had such an experience. the rooms were old dirty smelly and creepy. i don't know how else to describe it. besides the location this hotel has NOTHING going on for them. it is way overprized for what you get. not to mention the next spot of new age bubonic plague outburst - the restrooms in the lobby. GROSS!,amle
UR74712809,2010-11-August,Hotel Penn was probably the worst hotel that I've stayed in when I was travelling in the States for 5 months. First of all be wary of the staff manning the booth (that sells opera tickets/day trips etc.) which is located near the entrance. Initially the guy tried to con and 'force' us to buy the opera tickets which i later realised could be purchased at a cheaper price if you do not mind queueing up for the half priced tickets in NYC. Besides that on the last day when we were leaving the hotel as we were running late for our flight from NYC back to GA we asked him about the available options to get to the airport from the hotel. He psyched us to buy the bus tickets which were priced at about $15/person and told us that the bus was leaving in a matter of minutes. We decided to choose the bus option instead of taking the taxi as he lied to us that it would be double the price per person if we were to take the taxi instead! After paying for the bus tickets we immediately ran out to the bus stop to wait for the bus. After about 5 minutes of futile waiting we returned to the booth where he was only to find that the bus had already left without us. It made us wonder if he already knew that we would not be able to board the bus on time but still insisted that we bought the tickets so that he could get a commission from the sale. We wanted a refund but he strongly denied our request. And since we were in a rush for time we left the hotel quickly to baord a taxi thereafter realising that it was definitely cheaper to take the taxi to LGA airport instead of taking the bus! Besides the booth the hotel experience was bad. The room that we stayed in was located at the far end from the lift and the a/c was not functioning properly in the room thus it felt as if we were in an oven during the 2 nights we spent there. Also the room was very squeezy for 4 (girls) of us. The toilet was small and it wasn't very clean either. On the other hand the other room that my friends stayed in were nearly twice the size of ours (despite paying the same price) so it really depends on your luck if you ever choose to book a room with Hotel Penn. Nevertheless the only good thing about the hotel would be its location as it is almost impossible to find such a price for the rooms at such an ideal location!,thechubber
UR78992618,2010-10-September,Lobby looked promising but room was very shabby and bathroom was very bad! Couldn't use shower coz too powerful and scarey! Bath water was green! New York itself more than made up for it and couldn't have chosen better location but this hotel is in serious need of a revamp and maintenence check! Not for romantic stay bt with friends just for sleep is ok if you're not too fussy! x,taylorc19
UR82907392,2010-10-October,Arrived at 11am at the desk and the African lady at the desk said we cannot check in at this time and to come after 3pm and if we need to keep the bags they will charge US$4.- per bag. So we went out with all our bags and came again at 4pm. This time the cleark was so good she said sorry for the morning incident. The room was cold and the heater was not working. Shower tap cannot close properly.(need a hammer to close it) There were two bags of garbage near my door and it was still there when I got up in the next morning.,digaUsa
UR58245897,2010-10-March,stayed there for 5 nights in march. lobby was fine but was disgusted when we got to the room. it was small dark dirty the window wouldn't open the air vent in the bathroom was broken. had to ask for a room change immediately was moved to a bigger room at no extra expense. this was cleaner and bigger but very old fashioned and badly needs to be updated. staff were not very helpful at any stage. location was great. wouldn't recommend it to any friends and wouldn't stay there again if i return to new york.,lee911
UR53117294,2010-10-January,Great location close to Times Square Penn Station etc but our room was small dark and needed updating. The bathroom didn't feel clean hairs on the floor and in the sink. The man at the front desk was sarcastic and quite rude when our room key failed to work making it feel as if it was our fault.,LJTBristol
UR55644633,2010-10-February,It's been a couple of day's since I've been back so thank God no bed bugs....but I wouldn't put it past this hotel. Bathtub was filthy floors filthy staff (maid service) unprofessional at best....they had no problem standing outside our door for over an hour gossiping and screaming while we were trying to get a little peace and quiet. they also did not understand 'late checkout'....i don't know how many times we told them and we continually disturbed. Lights broken out in hallway filth on the carpet.,linzatorte
UR89506208,2010-10-December,Although this hotel is a brilliant location the rooms are awful! The bathrroms in particular were bad with a constant leaking tap peeling paster stained bath etc! The windows are also very bad at blocking all the noise from madison sq gardens so bring ear plugs!,LondonTeddy85
UR74611331,2010-10-August,After being on a train for 13 hours we recieved the most horrible customer service you could get I had reservations for 6 months and they turned my trip into a nightmare at 2am then gave me the worst looking room I have ever stayed in Not somewhere I would recommend and for the quality its over priced!,CHERYLM25901
UR85553646,2010-1-November,It was a terrible experience. We expected a lot from this hotel since it is quite expensive. We found a dirty room with hairs on the bed and on the floor the floor was sticky very little light broken closet paint on ceiling and on walls fell in pieces cracks everywhere broken framedoors. One day the houskeeper did not clean the room and they let sheets over the bed and we had to do their work. The beds are small and the sheets even more so when you turn you uncover the other person. There was no hair dryer heating did not work. Is a hotel in which there are many young people and schools groups and at nights you can heard screams laughter and people running. Finally when we went to complain to all this the lady at reception was not at all sympathetic or understanding just the opposite she told us that why we were explaining all that things to her if she could not do anything! Nothing similar about what appears in the pictures on the web. Neither the rooms nor the service are good. There are better and cheapest hotels around.,nammoc
UR66106243,2010-1-June,When viewing photos for this hotel the room I booked looked pretty decent. My boyfriend and I got there and saw a luxurious looking lobby but when we got to our floor it felt as if we had entered a completely different hotel if not MOTEL. Our room looked very shoddy and here's what I have to complain about it: 1) half the lights in the room weren't working 2) couldn't turn off the TV (the remote didn't work the TV buttons didn't work...) 3) the outlets weren't working 4) there were holes in the blanket 5) the room wasn't cleaned whatsoever (used towel still hanging on the rack) 6) ceiling looked like it was going to collapse at any moment and the list goes on!!! Seriously spending close to $200 on a so-called "renowned" hotel that looks like crap on the interior is just really frustrating. Going to a motel this sort of thing might be expected but definitely not in a hotel that ranks 3-4 stars. Some motels I've gone to in the past have looked nicer than this one!!! Anyway we went downstairs to complain and they upgraded us to the Penn 5000 suite or something...well...it was a tad bit more spacious came with a flat screen TV everything worked fine EXCEPT that there was yet another used towel hanging on the bathroom door. Also there was a half used bottle of mouthwash which says to me that again the room was not cleaned. Even when we complained to the lobbyist she shook her head and said "ughhh I don't get why this keeps happening!!!",caprica113
UR52324260,2010-1-January,We stayed here for 2 nights after 4 nights in another hotel in the heart of Times Square we didn't take much time researching the hotel as we had been in to the reception and it seemed to be ok...good location good facilities etc...what a mistake we made!! We arrived at 8am and as it was too early to check in they charged us $4 per bag to store our bags!!! I think this is terrible I have travelled the world and have never been charged for this service we were also charged again when we checked out on our last day as we had a few hours to wait before leaving for the airport. When we went back that afternoon to check in we waited in a queue for 45 mins!!!! There was plenty of counters but only 2 staff working when we eventually did check in the staff were not very interested or polite. We took the lift to the room and I was shocked when the doors opened...it was the most gloomiest dullest hotel I have been in. The room we had was huge but the bed did not seem like a double and was rock solid. Me and my husband could just about both fit in...it was definitely not a double. The sheets were horrible and smelt I slept on my own blanket. Yes you don't spend much time in the hotel room in NYC but it's not good when you're dreading having to go back to the hotel room at all! When we were checking out it took another 40 mins and again the employee was very abrupt and unhelpful. All I can say is I'm glad we only had 2 nights there and not our full trip. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone!!!! DO NOT STAY HERE!!,jemma546
UR48834113,2009-9-November,As I sit here writing this review I'm taking a breathing treatment because of all the mold and mildew problems with this hotel. Just stay away from it if you can!! I have stayed here quite a number of times (all against my will) because of my job. Sure the location is decent but there are other hotels around the area that are much nicer than this one. You might pay a little more but it will be clean. There is mold everywhere not just the rooms. It's in the hallways too. And everytime I have stayed there they are always paintning the hallways. I think they are trying to cover up the smell of the mold. The halls look like they're from the movie the Shining and the rooms look like they haven't been thoroughly cleaned since 1950! I'm surprised that the Health Department of New York hasn't shut it down! They must be paying somebody off! When you check in the line is always long because they only have 2 people working the desk and thats it! For a hotel that has over 1700 rooms you'd think they'd have more staff at the check in counter. Please NYC please shut down this horrible hotel!!,Dukecat
UR23411893,2009-9-January,We stayed for 5 days and reading all the other reviews I must say this hotel has 2 faces. The quality differs per floor and room very much. On arrival they offered us a horrible worn out dirty room (4th floor) (I thought that a corpse had been hidden under the bed for a month or so!!). We wisely refused to move in and insisted on a solution. That took some time but one of the receptionist made good effort and offerd us an excecutive room on 12th floor and that was reasonable. We had to pay an adittional $25 a day but as an extra breakfast coffe and tea a fridge and internet acces (free) was included not a bad deal. I cannot understand how such big differences are possible in one hotel. And we were not the only couple with this problem. We were with 4 couples together and without any doubt they were offered the same lousy dirty [--] rooms at first also (and of course they refused as well). They also got upgraded after complaining. Strange place Hotel Penn!,Oscar2009
UR29601584,2009-8-May,I booked this property due to its' location across from Penn Station. I booked onloine and chose the Penn 5000 club option. Their website is very misleading. The room I got was so small there was barely room for my suit case. i HAVE BEEN IN SOME RAT HOLES BUT NOT AT THE PRICE I PAID FOR THIS! The King size bed smelled musky. The floor AC unit had a constant rattle (engineering never showed up to fix it). The bathroom had a very small shower only. The bare white walls showed numerous scuff marks. My friends in New York laughed about the hotel with the "I know" response to this property. I paid extra for the club amenties. I got very little in return. I would stay away this property. I would tell my worst enemy not to stay here. Word is the owners want to tear it down. I see why!,Scott6942
UR23382246,2009-8-January,Having just flown into New York from London and being tired we arrived at the hotel. Checking in took over an hour as the queue was long and there were only three people on the check in desk. We got to our room and it was very basic and cleaned to a minimal standard the corridors in the hotel looked like something from a horror movie! The light was missing a cover and was buzzing the housekeeper let herself into our room not realising we were in she appologised and I asked her if all the rooms were like this. She told me that the hotel also scared her when she was on her own. Our window did not close properly and maintainence failed to sort it for us. Staff weren't particularly friendly and definitely not a hotel that we would recommend to anyone or use again! If you can afford to pay more then do it!,BurnleyLancashire_UK
UR40060054,2009-7-September,During my stay at the Penn.hotel I've complained about my room for the first time ever. I have been in shabby hotels before but this was really unacceptable! During my first night I got bitten by bedbugs that's wasn't fun at all.... Early in the morning I went to the front desk and the man at the desk didn't seem to be impressed by my complaint he didn't even seem to do anything with it. I got another room dough the first was spacious I now got a room without any daylight only one small lamp. As the first room was very filthy many layers of dust dirty hairs in the badroom and many stains and other dirt around the place. The next room was as filthy as the first even dirthy towels... In the evening I got anohter unpleasant surprise a huge spot on the sheet groose!! So even if you don't have much of a budget avoid this place! Even for this price it should be cleaner! But NYC is great!,Corina82
UR24328597,2009-7-February,I booked this through Alpharooms (never again) their website is misleading to say the least-yes this is a budget Hotel but what is the excuse for dirty rooms and dire customer service. I have never had such a dreadful experience as I had to check out and find myself an alternative. Alpharooms were most unhelpful as all they could offer was in an entirely different location I was more than willing to upgrade but this didn;t do the trick either.,LadyMP
UR50819876,2009-7-December,This hotel has a beautiful lobby but aside from that... It's TERRIBLE. When I arrived after a 7hr flightmy room was not ready so I had to check in my bags and wait 2hrs. Mind you it was about 4pm. When I got upstairs to my room I was actually a little scared. The room was dingy and smelled moldy. The paint was coming off the wall.The towels had yellow stains on them.The windows lookedlike the hadn't been cleaned in years. The walls are paper thin.The light by the entrance didnt work so I had to depend on the dim desk light. The carpet was nasty and the tv has about 15 channels. This hotel is by far the nastiest hotel ever. Now on too the service... The maid just bust in the room several times without knocking and even with the PRIVACY sign on the door. Thank God I had the littlelatch thing on. Then I go to use the computer and find out it's $1 for every 5min. and $.75 to print. The people at the desk are rude adn have no answers for anything. I would not stay here.,tjporter
UR34024430,2009-6-July,If you are used to clean new hotels then this hotel is NOT for you. We stayed at the newly renovated section of the hotel and the rooms/hallways were still rather shabby and run down. We supposedly had a larger room with two double beds and a small washroom. Actually the room was quite cramped but manageable. The hotel felt more like a hostel than a hotel but after one day we sort of got used to it. The staff were pleasant enough. One thing that I thought was strange was how dark the hallways were - it was if all the bulbs were on a dimmer switch. The location was ideal and ultimately this is what you are paying for. My main concern were bed bugs which luckily did not appear. The fitness room was on the 19'th floor however the elevator only went up to the 18'th. From there you had to walk up a shabby set of stairs (kind of creepy) to the gym which had decent enough fitness machines. Ultimately you get what you pay for (150 per night) and if you want a nicer hotel you can either spend an extra 100 dollars per night or stay in Newport New Jersey at the beautiful Westin Hotel for the same price and take the 10 minute Path train ride into and out of NYC.,VacationMeister
UR36800262,2009-5-August,if you arrive on a weekend at night be prepared to wait more than one hour in line for check in. Then deal with unfriendly personal to get a room. (we needed to switch rooms three times because they gave us a smoking room or the toilet wouldn't work. The person behind the counter expressed annoyance to have to deal with this. after one and a half hour we had an acceptable room.) There is really obnoxious personal behind the front desk. The rooms are greasy in our room the mattress was falling apart and the room was very dusty. The restaurant (Lindy's located in the hotel) serves VERY high priced low quality food and drinks. That is not New York City! That's just a tourist rip off!!! Altogether staying at this hotel left a unnecessary bad memory with a else joyful stay in the City.,mrtravel31415
UR27442101,2009-5-April,I stayed with a friend for 5 nights in this brilliantly located hotel. The decor is old and the rooms are quite small. The windows were filthy. On the 4 night of our stay our room was broken into while we slept - our phones and bags were taken. This was bad enough but the lack of care and attention we received from management and staff the next morning was incredible - they trid to convince us we left the door open! We then had to walk to the police station - they didnt even offer us a cab. We spent a few hours at the station and then the police came back to the hotel. Apparently this is a regular occurance! Funnily enough the bags showed up that evening with the wallets empty of course. Apparently staff found them on teh back stairs even though security had told us they had walked the stairs that morning!!!! There was definetly something suspicious about the way it was dealt with and i certainly will not return to that hotel. I couldnt reccommend it any less - not for the security consious anyway!,anidon
UR33891780,2009-4-July,seems like they never clean anything lots of dust on everything stained towels bugs crawling out of shower drain superloud a/c plain disgusting as far ar quality of the rooms. The staff seemed a bit unmotivated. The only thing that speaks for this hotel is its location directly across from Madison Square Garden and about 2 blocks from Empire State Building. Penn Station is also right there.,qtqt17
UR50646249,2009-4-December,After a 20 hour flight to have to camp in the lobby for 2 hours to get attended to by one of the 2 people on service for 40 waiting guests. Thje lobby looks wonderfull but this is only a scam hiding the fact that this hotel is run down and poorly maintained with incredibly bad service and cracked and peeling paint in the rooms. The TV was faulty and when i tried to complain there was no one to talk to. This hotel has a captive audience with some of the airlines and therefore YOU are not inportant to them but as room fillers.,edtal
UR24064781,2009-31-January,I went to this hotel for my 40th birthday and I have to say it is the worst hotel I've ever stayed in. I never want to go back. The room was old dated yellow net curtains stains on the floors. Disgusting foul and depressing. The staff were rude and arrogant. Although cheap do not stay there if you go to New York for the first time and have great expectations. Nothing more to say only YUCK!,JaneyhBedfordshire
UR50349343,2009-30-November,After reading the other reviews on here i was a little worried about staying at hotel penn. but i can say in all honesty its really not that bad sure its old but the room we had was clean and the shower was hot and after 20 hours on a plane you need a good shower! its a great location so close to eveythingits nothing flash but it does the job. i would stay there again and lets be onest who goes to nyc to spend all day in a hotel room............,bigmawn
UR29112620,2009-30-April,this place was a total dump. from the second we walked in the lobby was filthy and the staff unprofessional and poorly trained. Our room was extremely hot and had no fan or AC. There was no fridge to keep our drinks cold. The walls were bare white and dirty with old nails hanging where a picture was supposed to hang. The hallway leading to our hotel was poorly lit and just gross. Basically the whole hotel was covered in dustbunnys and needs to be renivated and cleaned. They need more staff and room service aswell. All they care about is raking in your money. There was random trash crumpled up papers and tons of dust balls in the hall ways and throughout the entire hotel. When we asked to speak to a manager on the way out of our ONE night stay the clerk went to get her and then disappeared. Then we asked another clerk to see a manager and they finally got her. She was rude and did not give us any type of refund or compensation and continued to tell us that New York was an expensive place etc. Overall just do not go there. dirty and overpriced,ColbyHarris
UR52097392,2009-29-December,All you can really say about this hotel (which prides itself on being one of the oldest in NYC) is that it is central and within striking distance of major tourist attractions. The facilities have been franchised out and the Diner off the front lobby is overpriced (The Tick Tock or Starlight a couple of blocks away are better). There also plenty of local delis where you can get breakfast or sandwiches made up. The rooms and hallways are well past their sell by date and pretty gloomy - we were all struck by its resemblance to the backdrop of The Shining and half expected to bump into Jack Nicholson doing his psychopath impersonation every time we took the lift. Thankfully we didn't come to NY to stay in a hotel and preferred to eat and drink elsewhere mainly because we wanted to but also because you have no choice.,Mike058
UR26974626,2009-28-March,This huge hotel is in a great location right opposite Madison Square Gardens and around the corner from Macy's. If our room was anything to go by the room pictured above must be in a hotel around the corner. Our room was dark dingy not very appealing and in dire need of upgrading. However as you are in New York you don't spend too much time in your room anyway so we just made the best of it. We found New Yorkers very friendly people and had a great holiday unfortunately the staff in this hotel are the rudest I have come across. Particularly one lady who checked us in and clearly couldn't care less about the customers. I don't think I would stay here again even though its a great location. Note: we were 3 female friends on a shopping trip who booked and paid for a triple room... myself and one friend had to share a double bed as the company I booked it with classifies this as a triple room- worth clarifying with your provider if you are booking the same.,missfruity
UR33363837,2009-28-June,We stayed at this hotel for four miserable nights. The only reason we did not check out immediately is because we had pre paid and no longer had the additional funds for another hotel. We have stayed in many hotels around the world this is deffinately the worst ever. The rooms were dirty and the furniture broken. The staff were amongst the most rude I have ever come across paticularly at reception. Thank god we know how good America and the American people are because this gave such a bad impression.,Magic2002
UR36051168,2009-28-July,I stayed here because I was assigned to the hotel through a pricing website and didnt have an option to change it. The hotel was in a nice location and easy to get to. The lobby was very nice but we waited in line for over 10 minutes to check in and there was no reason for that when 5 people were working at the desk. I still have no idea what took the man so long to check us in once it was our turn!! The room was small but fine. It was VERY simple and not up to date at all. The bed linens were probably 10 years old and im sure the carpetting and drapes were older than that. The room was clean just not homey. The bathroom was clean but falling a part. Tiles were missing on the walls the shower just had a gross dinginess to it with awful water pressure and the cold water knob on the sink was stuck until we had to struggle for 10 minutes to force it loose. We requested more towels and never received them until we stopped a housekeeper in the hallway and the concierge gave us incorrect information about a location we were trying to get to. The hotel is fine if you are looking for a basic no frills nothing fancy place for under $150. But I would not personally stay there again unless it was a last resort.,princessjocie
UR50174300,2009-27-November,I'd read the reviews on this site and approached our trip with a fair degree of concern. However I had a mixed experience and wanted to try and write a balanced review. As most reviews (good and bad) seem to agree you can't do much better for location. Checking in wasn't the horror I expected it was pretty standard. I did see a big queue at reception once during our 5 days. I think if your unlucky enough to arrive at the same time as a lot of other people then you'll have to wait otherwise not a problem. BAD STUFF: The room we were given was as poor as some of the reviews have suggested. Spartan dated decor. Flaking plaster film of dirt all over the bathroom from the open window. It clearly hadn't been cleaned or occupied in some time. Probably the worst room I've ever been given and believe me I've stayed in some toilets in my time. GOOD STUFF: I went to reception explained the situation and that I'd like to be moved. I was given the key card to another another room and asked to inspect to make sure I was satisfied before they moved us. The room I was offered was fine clean and reasonably well appointed. Nothing fancy but perfectly acceptable as a base for our purposes. In summary this hotel clearly does have some poor rooms but it also has some reasonably decent ones too. If you get one of those then it's a good place to stay at a reasonable price in the centre of town. If you get a bad one make sure you get moved. Oh and agree with the person who liked the guys in the baggage room. Great guys!,shed55
UR26944803,2009-27-March,I stayed here for 4 nights with 4 other friends. Unfortunately we forgot to check the reviews on TripAdvisor before we went. Big mistake. We got a good rate and booked the hotel because not only was it reasonable the location was great too. It is right opposite Madison Square Gardens and within walking distance of lots of the main stores. We enjoyed a Knicks game and to be fair did not spend a lot of time in the hotel. However.....3 of us were in a top-floor room and despite it being very dated it was ok. The shower wasn't great but as we spent most of our time out we did not really have an issue with this. 2 of our other friends were not so lucky. They requested a smoking room and were put in a room a few floors below us. On the first night we got a hysterical phonecall. Getting ready to go out our friends had suddenly seen a rodent. They claimed it was a rat but could have been a mouse. They did not hang around to find out. They called Reception and demanded to be moved. After convincing Reception that they needed a new room a member of staff was sent up. Bizarrely with a plunger. He did nothing to help and as our friends were being moved out of their room another member of staff was showing a new couple of guests in to move into the room! They then moved to another room. And the following night.....found more rats/mice (they weren't sure which but definitely rodents) in their room again. It seriously affected their experience of the holiday as they spent most of the time at Hotel Penn scared and worried that they might find more vermin in their rooms. As well as the constant packing and unpacking. The hotel's attitude was even worse. Our friends had to argue persistently to even get a reduction on their rate despite what they experienced. All of the rooms that we saw in the hotel had big gaps underneath the doors where we understand the vermin would run in....we saw many rooms where people had actually rolled up towels and stuffed them under the door. This hotel was disgusting. I am just glad we did not spend a lot of time there. I would never stay there again. The staff could have been more helpful/sympathetic yet they just acted as if seeing a mouse or rat in your room was an everyday occurance. Despite the good location I won't be staying there again. Ironically when we got back we checked the TripAdvisor website and saw lots of other reviews which had suffered the same experience as us. Moral of the story: check reviews before you go! I am surprised this hotel has not closed down.,rachelopps
UR30803253,2009-26-May,Our Hotel Pennsylvania experience started when we arrived at 7:00 p.m. on a holiday weekend. While we waited online for approximately 1 hour to check in (which we were told is relatively short) in a lobby with no air conditioning I needed to use the restroom. The concierge sent me to a basement area straight out of a slasher movie without telling me that you needed a room key to access the restroom itself. My husband got a temporary key while I took my turn in line and upon return from the restroom told me that it was filthy. Once we got our room key we walked down a hallway with doors that looked like prison cells and entered our tiny and poorly maintained room that clearly had not gotten a paint job a tub scrubbing or any other maintenance since the hotel was built a century ago. The air conditioning wasnt working so we called maintenance who pulled out the most clogged filter Ive ever seen and said that the AC should be working by the time we came back from dinner. It wasnt and we had to switch rooms at 11:00 at night. The 2nd rooms AC wasnt working either by the way. A miserable experience from beginning to end.,NeverAgainNewYork
UR38861642,2009-26-August,I made my trip arrangements trough a travel agent and had no choice concerning the hotel since it was a great deal and prices were really a bargain. After reading the reviews we were terrified and almost decided to cancel the reservations and get another hotel even if we had to pay for high fees for that. But then we decided to relax and give it a try if it was that terrible we would simply walk away and find another place to stay. We arrived around 1pm and there were only 3 guests waiting in the line for check in. I thought we had a great beginning since all reviews told about the huge lines. But when I walked up to the rude attendant he yelled at me saying he had no rooms available for an early check-in. I tryed to explain that we didn't want an early check-in we just wanted to do all the check-in procedures and leave our luggage while we waited and had a meal somewhere in the nearby. Impossible to communicate with the old schmuck we gave up and decided to wait until the check-in time. When we got back to the lobby at around 3 pm the line was huge! After waiting more than 1 hour when it was my turn I told the attendant (this time was a nice one) I wanted a refurbished room. He told me he would see what he had to offer us and I emphasized that it had to be either a refurbished room or a spacious room since we requested a TPL. He was really nice and told me he had a good room for us and despite not being a renovated room he was sure we would like it. And he also told us we could come back and talk to him if we were not satisfied with the room. While we were walking down the hall (on 2nd floor) we were really scared: it's the creepiest place I've ever been to the smell of mold was disgusting and the carpet and walls looked really shabby. But when we got to our room I can tell you: it wasn't bad at all. It was a huge room with two double beds plenty of place walk-in closet with iron and ironboard and the bathroom was one of the renovated ones. We were really relieved the room was perfect for what we needed and also clean (no smell of mold). A/C was working properly beds were ok water pressure and temperature fine everything was just fine. So I wrote this huge review just to tell you the following: 1. The hotel is creepy old and service is terrible. BUT you might be lucky if you ask for a good room in the front desk by the check-in time. Don't forget to be polite you get what you give; 2. Location is great can't beat for this price in Manhattan; 3. Don't expect anything you are used to have in "standard" hotels it will certainly be worse in the Penn. But remember that in Manhattan the Penn's really a cheap place so you will get cheap service and a cheap hotel.,Mari_BR_SP
UR47698262,2009-25-October,The website is VERY misleading. I chose this hotel for convienence to the train station and that is all it was convienient. Upon entering the lobby you get the feeling that it is competive with other NYC hotels. But it is not. With 30 minutes in line for check in they could have had many more people working the front desk. Our room was on the 16th floor. Upon arrival to the floor is was the most dismal and eerie hallway. Apparently not ALL the rooms are renovated as advertised. We opened the door to flip on the light switch and found no lights....had to walk around in the dark to find a light and when we turned it on....wow....what an awful place to stay!! I immediately called down to have my room changed and was told that they were booked for the night....after the front desk just informed me that they were not full. When i questioned this I was told...my room type was booked for the night. 2 double beds. Talk about absolute bare bones. NOTHING on the walls no pictures NO mirror. It was just like a dorm room with not one ammenity. The bathroom was very old and the window stayed cracked at 2 inches. There were not enough towels to accomodate us so i called down for more towels and did not get what i had asked for. We were not in the room when they arrived and came back to find them thrown on the bed. The hallway was very noisy The next day we were charged to have our luggage held in the cellar. After $340 for the room that was terrible you think they could have held our luggage for nothing. The luggage man informed us that the hotel was like a book that should never be judged from its cover. ALOT of misinformation from the website to the staff. Absolutely would NEVER stay in this hotel again for any reason.,ilovenycAnnapolis_Md
UR30687900,2009-25-May,This place should be close imediatly for renovation it is a shame as the location is very good. The hotrel it is disgusting dirth old and very bad care and is possible to hear everything from the rooms near. NO PRIVACY No Internet No Safety deposit box No Service in Room or front desk. How can this being call a Hotel ? I coming from Brasil Rio and have my own B&B in Rio them more I see Hotels more sure I am that I have a great place. The Hotels are rip of people and not worried with anyone. The location do not bit my confort to sleep. So never again and dont reccomend even to a not friend .,MartaRIO
UR26828007,2009-25-March,Just returned from this hotel I stayed there one night and requested one of there REFURBISHED ROOMS with full working bathroom when I booked on the internet When i got to the desk the woman in charge would have made a good concentration camp commandant for the nazis so off hand about everything and said you booked a standard room and thats what your getting. so I said I would like to speak to the duty manager and he wasnt much better .I had stated on my booking form if the room wasnt to my liking I wanted to cancel and when I told the manager this and showed him my copy with it all in black and white he went all sweetness and like and gave me a room on the 11th floor which was quite nice I returned to the hotel three dayslater as I had been out of town and requested the same room this time the desk clerk????? was asian and again he had the same attitude as the first woman .saying who told you that you request a room you have the room that you are given so again I asked for the duty manager which the asian guy didnt like .anyway the room that I had before was occupied but I asked for another room on the 11th floor and again the room was quite nice with everything in full working order. Then when I went to check out 4 days later the guy on the desk said DO YOU OWE THIS HOTEL ANY MONEY .so yet again I asked for the manager and told him how BLOODY rude is staff were and they should all be sent to a charm school for a few months I told the manger that US the publice were keeping them in work and they think that they can treat you like dirt well DONT stand for it if your not satisfied with the room keep on looking at different ones until you find one that satisfies you after all we PAY enough to stay in these places and stand up to the staff dont let them walk all over you. Remember you are paying there wages and without us they wouldnt have jobs. VERY STRANGE HOW THEY ALL HAVE THIS ATTITUDE PROBLEM IN NEW YORK  I find the hotel ok for the money its not the hotel its the STAFF,fulovideas
UR23882168,2009-25-January,I stayed at this hotel 12 years ago and had a great experience sadly I can't say the same now. The lobby looks great but once you step out of the lift it is depressing and beyond disgusting. The 1st room was dark couldn't walk around the bed for the size of the room and the amount of furniture. We were offered another room which was dirty beyond words. The level of dust on the door closing mechanism was unreal the carpets thread bare paint was flaking off walls and ceiling; electrical socket hanging off the wall furniture vandalised and a general sense that the room hadn't been thoroughly cleaned in months. We couldn't stay in that room due to the levels of dust and my husband is asthmatic (triggered by dust mites) we complained and the hotel manageress was downright rude and entirely unhelpful in every respect. My husband explained that the holiday was for our wedding anniversary and we expected a clean room - her reply "This isn't the hotel for a special occasion!" and the criticism of the lack of hygiene and basic cleanliness entlrely unfazed her. To be honest I don't know for what purpose you would stay at this hotel unless it was to wallow in a deep clinical depression or consider taking your own life. DO NOT FALL FOR THE WEBSITE AND THE REFURBISHMENT CLAIMS - THEY ARE BLATANT LIES! If we could find the NYC department responsible for tourism we would be reporting this hotel and showing them the photographic evidence we have. Sadly as our hotel was paid via an agent who was inaccessible to us at the time we felt we had no choice but to get on a flight back to the UK as we had no budget to find another hotel. Sadly tainted my previous wonderful experience of NY. I hope no-one else has to experience the condition of this hotel and the rudeness of the manageress!,Demoralised
UR50000898,2009-24-November,Ok i saw a lot of good and bad reviews on this site about this hotel. Many people saying "I dont know why people leave bad reviews" Well i have EVERY RIGHT TO LEAVE THE WORST REVIEW FOR THE WORST HOTEL ON EARTH - FACT! I stayed int his hotel with a group for a conference back in March. It looked amazing and so did the website and pictures. Well the best thing about the hotel is the LOCATION! right outside madison square gardens empire state and Macys so you in the heart of the big apple! Great huh? Well dont get your hopes up! The wonderful start. The que to check in took 1 hour. Yes 1 hour. 2 people serving 100's of guests = 1 hour. Not well staffed or managed + rude staff not very friendly for a hotel in the big apple. I have traveled most of the world and have never came across a hotel like this! I am not the fussy person who says oh the door handle was faded or the water was to hot!!!!! The interior of the corridors of the hotel was so old fashioned and run-down it looked like an old hospital from the 50's! Just out of a horror movie. That is the start. Our room was NOT for 3 people as i was sharing with 2 girls. They had to sleep together in one bed as they would not transfer us to a triple bedded room. Lucky i was not sharing with 2 boys!!!!! When asking to transfer room they would simply NOT!!! VERY RUDE STAFF!!!!!! Although half the hotel was empty!!!!! The room had STAINS ON THE FLOOR BED WALLS AND BASICALLY ANYWHERE ELSE YOU CAN TOUCH!!!!!! Bed sheets were stained & ripped!!! Lights in the room were broken central heating broken!! TV BROKEN!!!!!! The beautiful view you ask?? USA STYLE AMERICAN PRISON BARS!!! Not joking! Why this was the case i do not know. NO body would jump out the window because the room was in a middle of no where courtyard (a small flat land in middle of the hotel with no place to go or jump. So i see no need + the amount of litter thrown there was SHOCKING! The room had about 10% daylight the rest of the time it was very dark and cold. Bathroom where do i begin mirror was cracked mold and dirt ont he tiles and to finish it off the toilet seat was broken + the shower was VERY tempermental shooting hot and cold water in turn????? This is not the standard for American hotels and think it should be shut down. This has standards for a hostel. I am a genuine customer who stayed here and would never stay again. Please please e-mail me for about 30 pictures of the condition of my room. It was dreadful. This was not a way to start a conference in NYC. The most fun i had was out and about and dreadded the walk back to the hotel every night. I was shocked and appauled with the condition and since then sent several letters of complaint to the hotel which i have had no reply. You have been warned. Do not make the same mistake i made!!!!! & for 90 a night i do expect a LOT FOR MONEY!!! 90 a night is not cheap for a 1 star hotel!!!!!! This should not even have a star it should be classed as a HOSTEL! In Europe for example Prague a 5 star hotel i stayed in cost me only 70 a night and that was 5 star. Pictures and website is 100% MISLEADING THAT IS NOT WHAT I GOT NOR ANYONE ELSE ON MY GROUP GOT. We are going back this March to NYC for the conference and have stayed well clear from this hotel.,Dubai-Mafia
UR35633671,2009-24-July,Me and my boyfriend stayed here for three nights. From the photos on the hotels website it looked like a nice hotell but this was totally misguiding! Nice lobby and location but a crappy room so to speak. My boyfriend planned to propose to me in this wonderful hotell (!) but luckily he changed his plans when he got to see it. I would never stay here again inspite of the great location! Bedroom lamp was plugged in from the bathroom so we couldn't close the door without having the other sit in the dark! Well my best tip is to find another place to stay!!!,NorgeNorway_Oslo2
UR38710443,2009-24-August,We arrived on a Saturday with friends from oversees. The check in line was ridiculously long. We paid extra for the "Penn 5000" club amenities. That was suppose to include a separate check in desk. Forget it that place was never open the entire 4 days we stayed there. The rooms are NOT as they appear on their website. They are much smaller. The room we booked was supposed to have a comfortable chair. Not so. The room was dirty. The walls carpet bedspread (complete with cigarette burns) drapes all dirty. The bathroom had cracked and missing tiles and an old radiator that leaked constantly. When we complained to the RUDE front desk agent about the lack of comfortable chair and dirty room he told us we had to wait until after 4:00 pm to see if there would be another room available. The "Penn 5000" amenities also included a free breakfast. That was suppose to be for those guests with special access with their room cards. Forget it. Anyone could (and did) just walk right in and have breakfast. When we finally did get our room changed the room key card didn't work right. Between us and our friends we had to get our key cards rekeyed at least 4 times. And that meant standing in that ridiculously long line at check in every time. Don't pay extra for the "Penn 5000" club. You don't get anything extra for it. The business center and fitness center were both minimal. The only good thing going for this hotel is the location. Walking distance to everything.,grampaSanDiego
UR32885126,2009-22-June,Don't let the lobby (or the amount of time spent in line to check-in) fool you. The rooms are nasty! Period! Our room had carpet stains that resembled a body outline at a crime scene. We expected to see something scurry across the floor at any moment. When we went to turn on the air conditioner 100 years of dust and debris flew out of it and it started shaking violently. The noise it was making was SO loud that the front desk operator could not hear me when I called for maintenance. One hour after I called for the repair a hotel employee arrived. At this point we were ready to just check out because we had additionally realized that no electrical outlets worked the toilet had something in it that would NOT flush the shower wall looked as if the previous guests had taken a sledge hammer to it the sink faucet fell in my hand while I was trying to wash the dust from the air conditioner off my hands and the room just plain ole smelled dreadful. All in all it was the worst hotel experience of my life from check in to check out. Oh and don't even get me started on the fact that they assured me that my credit card would not be charged (since we checked in/out in the same hour practically) --- only to find out much to my dismay that they did in fact charge me for 3 nights. It was an act of congress to get a hotel manager to assist me (2 days later) in getting the charges reversed. I can't for the life of me understand how Hotel Pennsylvania is still in business. Save your money and your sanity...stay somewhere else. (a park bench in Central Park would have been a better choice),lovestotravel91964
UR49718224,2009-21-November,This was my wife & I's 10th ANNIVERSARY. We live in QUEENS NEW YORK and I decided that we spend the nght in Manhatton and have dinner at an great restaurant. My wife works not far from the hotel so she got there before me. When I finally reached the hotel room after parking the car (VALET-PARKING $40.OO FOR 24-HOURS) my wife was sitting on the bed rocking back and forth and I could smell the very strong odor of bleach. I looked around the room and found: Used toilet paper sticking out from under the bed a dirty refrIgerater dirt and dust in very corner and on everthing bleach marked rug and the most nasty thing of all "THE TOILET HAD FECES YOU COULD SEE AROUND THE LIP OF THE BOWL". This room could not have been cleaned or inspected by anyone in "GOD KNOWS' how long. When I went to the phone to call the manager it had a thick coat of dirt on it and I had to use my hankerchief to pick it up. I asked the manager to come up to see the room (#1094) and the only thing he said was someone would be up to give us a key to a new room. It was late so we moved into the room (#1210) which was still small and dingy also having a bleached stained rug no view but I thought we could make it though the night . We got out of there as fast as we could to get fresh air and dinner. (WHICH WAS EXCELLENT-LUGO'S CAFFE) Upon returning to the room and attempting to get some rest (the room was not suited for romance) I kept hearing these noises. By the time I figured out what it was my wife had fallen to sleep but I couldn't. (ROOM # 1210 WAS IN BACK OF THE ELEVATOR SHAFT) Everytime one of them went up or down I would hear it. I thought we had checked into the " HOLLYWOOD HOTEL'' which is a ride in DISNEYLAND & DISNEYWORLD called the "TOWER OF TERROR'. Early in the morning I went down to the front desk and told the morning manger about the horrible stay (Carmen was her name) and she took half off of the price of the room and said that we could stay in the room after the normal check out. (Yeah right) Before she cut the price the room was $234.00 with tax. We should have gotten all the of our money back (INCLUDING THE PARKING MONEY) Why? Because this was worst than my three trips to VIETNAM and living in the jungle there and it screwed up our 10TH ANNIVERSARY. Oh by the way on the internet The lobby picutures are pretty accurate but the rooms FORGET ABOUT!! IN 200yrs. the rooms have taken a beating. In one night my wife and I took one. We cannot afford to do this again for awhile. I'll have to make this up to her later. The hotel has a lot of rooms in it but as CLINT EASTWOOD said in the movie "DO YOU FEEL LUCKY. (Our Stay was last week NOV. 13 2009 (FRIDAY THE 13TH> YOU THINK?) Sorry I'm late with the review but I am trying to forget this but I won't.,wildcat1012
UR28506750,2009-21-April,You walk into the hotel and the lobby is beautiful. Me being very cheap felt like I just found the best place in all of NY but then i saw the line which stretched pass the black tape to the point where workers were out putting up new tape. Ok this bugged me a bit but it wasn't all too bad. After about 45 minutes of waiting we got to the desk. I just discovered the problem - everyone working there had a collective IQ of about 50. Now I'm very tolerant but after fifteen minutes of trying to communicate with the woman at the desk I gave up and made my colleague do it. He too had to work with her for a solid fifteen minutes. Once we got our keys i wanted to go to the room and lay down a bit because my feet were killing me from standing in one place and it was late and I had practice at noon at Lincoln center. I was frightened by the room. It was small dirty and smelled. There was a hole in the wall with shards of glass an empty box of beer a shoe and lots of loose insulation. The walls were covered in what felt like grime. The bed was not soft and one was broken. The fridge did not cool - rather it heated. It warmed the room to a good 90 degrees and it heated the drink i bought to where it hurt when i touched it. I even had some cookies which were melted. The sink broke twice and i had to fix it because the service guy never showed the 3 times we called. The shower had no pressure and at one point just stopped flowing. The toilet didn't flush after 11pm and the tv would randomly turn on and off during the night making for a wonderful night's rest. Then the worst thing the morning of practice i woke up with red bites all over me. Great. Bugs in the beds. My two other colleagues had red marks as well and with that we immediately checked out (which also took about an hour),Jeffwoelfel
UR43184034,2009-20-September,Simply put I had rather sleep in the gutter than ever return here. I came home with bed bugs. For most of the staff English is not yet a second language. The lobby is always crowed with pushy airline personnel. I waited in line for nearly three hours (combined) to check in/out. This place should be closed for sanitary reasons. It has a documented history of bed bugs and other unacceptable "features." DO NOT BE A FOOL.: NEVER EVER STAY HERE!!!!!!!!!,MP8
UR39618282,2009-2-September,The only good thing about ths hotel is the location. The lobby is inviting displaying a grandeur which reflects its name. We were allocated room 411 which had fungus on the walls the showerroom was broken tiles and dilapidated. The toilet once flushed wouldn't stop running and we had to call maintenance five minutes into the stay. The clothes wardrobe was a bare-bricked hole in the wall with a louvre door. When we complained to the duty manager he was most unhelpful and suggested we book out - so we did. Object lesson - examine the rooms before you register with this group as its not what you see on the brochure. McShuggles Scotland,mcshuggles
UR45643966,2009-2-October,Yes the hotel is in a great location but it is filthy. I checked out at least 23 rooms and they were all dirty. I told the manager he should get rid of all his cleaning staff I would rather sleep on the street. I have travelled all over the World and have never come across such a dirty place. I would not stay here again if they paid me,taffyDavies
UR48361390,2009-2-November,This is possibly the worst hotel my family has had the misfortune to stay in anywhere in Europe or the US. We moved out the first night to the Holiday Inn not too far away on Lafayette. It was a bit more expensive but at least the rooms were clean and the bathrooms weren't rotten. I mean even the plughole had rusted away. If you like rust dirt blistered paint and that old 'Beirut' look fine. If you don't avoid like the plague. Their website is so outrageously removed from reality it's untrue. In the UK they'd be sued under the Trade Descriptions Act. It's a shame because the building is magnificent and the location fantastic.,denmate1960
UR33714667,2009-2-July,I stayed at the Penn on business. My first warning sign was the way too low prioce for New York / Manhatten! I worked for an idiot boss who was the poster child for penny wise pound foolish. This hotel had zero redeeming qualities. As a result little work if any got accomplished due to poor and embarrassing conditions of the hotel. The only thing positive I can write is that the location is convenient to all the major transportation and the convention center. Other than that you will be far better off camping in Central Park. Filthy would be the one word I use to describe this hotel - stay away. Folks there are no bargains in Manhatten. I don't care if you get a $20/nt rate you WILL get what you pay for in Manhatten. ~Safe and Pleasant Travels to All,SwissMr
UR23205400,2009-2-January,This is A BUDGET HOTEL in NYC. The only thing seperating this hotel from a hostel or a boarding house is that you do not have shared baths. It will be about $45.00 to get a cab from LGA to this hotel. When you pull up and enter you are being "hood-winked" or "bamboozeled" The lobby is beautiful. There is a large check in area there were even fresh flowers when we checked in. Since we arrived so early we were not able to check in but we were told to go to the ground floor and they would store our bags. Very sketchy looking area where they keep your bags. I had to go into DEEP prayer before I agreed to keep them down there. When we returned to check in the hotel was packed! I took this as a good sign; thinking that the hotel was popular and that a lot of people knew this was the place to stay. I WAS WRONG. The elevator was nice and clean with a flat screen tv. The minute you step off of the elevator you feel like you are in a different hotel. I felt like I went from a Hampton to Bates Motel. The air was not working in the hallways. It was dark musty smelling and HOT. There are holes in the walls missing wall paper FILTHY carpet. So I got to my room and I opened the door and just stood there. I told my friends to walk out cause I was not staying there. We went back to the front desk and as I waited I heard the couple behind me complaining about the same thing. When I got to the receiptionist I demanded the room that was on the internet. He gave me some random excuse for why I could not get that room but he did give me another room. Although this room was better than the first it was not what I wanted. We took a shower in our flip flops. The next morning I called my father and he asked me what the view was. So I got up (barefooted) and went to the window and stepped in a puddle of water (water went above my foot). The air-conditionar (a window unit) had leaked all night and all the water had accumulated in a dirty water puddle. So I got my friends up and went downstairs AGAIN and requested another room. We were switched again and the room was clean it just looked very worn and old. We still took showers with our flip flops. I have been to better hotels and mybe that is why I was not impressed with this. I did like that it was walking distance to many of the sights of the City. Other than that I will never return.,southernsurprise
UR36468726,2009-2-August,I booked this hotel because I was attending a show that was being held there. It started to fall apart as soon as we arrived. I was the 34th person in line to check-in and there were at least that many behind me - the line went all the way to the door! They only had 2 agents at the front desk so I called the hotel and asked for a manager and told them about the line to see if there was anybody else that could come help out the front desk. Her exact quote to me (in an extremely rude tone) was "who do you suggest we get to help out". I explained to her that I worked in the hotel industry and when there was a line at our hotel other departments jumped in to check people in and out. She then said that "this is a union hotel and we don't do that". So 45 minutes later we finally get checked-in! Check-in time at this hotel is 3:00pm and we arrived at this hotel at 3:15pm so there is no excuse for having such a short-staffed front desk. A hotel knows how many check-ins they are going to have that day! Now on to the rooms - I have never seen such a nasty hotel. I will post pictures after we get home. Paint peeling off the doors and I am not joking the hallways and doors make it look like a crack-house! The room does look like the pictures on the website as far as the decor but those pictures must have been taken 20 years ago because the room was nasty. There was even this huge hole in the wall next to the a/c and various stains on the walls. And in 2009 have you ever heard of a hotel with no wireless internet in the rooms? This hotel is dirty offers no services and has bad customer service. We loved the location since we took Amtrak up and had a toddler with us so we took a walk and looked for another hotel. The AFFINA is a block over and they were sold out so I didn't see the rooms. We ended up about 4 blocks away at the DOUBLETREE CHELSEA. It's only a 5 min walk and I highly recommend going there - our rate at the Doubletree was only $25 more than the Hotel Penn - well worth it. Brand new rooms clean wireless internet in the room room service ice machines and the people here are so nice! All the stuff you expect from a hotel! When I went to check-out (it was about 6:00pm at this time) the line was still there making me think that this may be a normal thing for this hotel. Like I said before RUN AWAY! You can see the AFFINA hotel from the Hotel Penn and the DOUBLETREE CHELSEA is a quick walk away (and we did it with suitcases a stroller and a 1 1/2 year old).,amberhariton
UR30264371,2009-19-May,I came to NYC with a friend for a long fun weekend. It was my first trip to the city. We had researched hotels online and finally settled on Hotel Pennsylvania. We chose it for the price and location plus we felt like it would be fun to stay in an older New York hotel. The pictures we viewed online showed a grand lobby and clean rooms. We arrived at the hotel and after waiting almost an hour to check in we finally were able to go upstairs to our room. The line to check in was insanely long and very slow moving. But we thought that was a reflection on what a great place it must be because surely it wouldn't be that busy if it weren't a nice place. We found out differently once we reached our room. There were so many things wrong with that room I'm not sure where to start. 1. The carpeting was very old and worn. There were multiple stains and it wrapped up over the baseboards around the edges of the room rather than being tacked down. 2. The tv cabinet was broken. It only had one door that was hanging slightly cock-eyed. The other door was missing. None of the drawers would close completely. 3. All of the furniture in the room was very worn and old and had bare spots where the finish had been worn off. 4. The cable for the television came from behind the cabinet and ran across the middle of the floor to a spot under the window right by an exposed water pipe. 5. None of the outlets in the room worked which we found out when we tried to plug in our cellphones to recharge them after a long trip. 6. The window was open and we had a very hard time getting it shut. We were told that we would be facing the Empire State Building. We WERE facing the Empire State Building but we couldn't see it because of the large brick building about 20 feet outside our window that extended up so far we could barely see the sky. 7. The faucet on the sink came off when we tried to use it. 8. The bathtub had a large hole in the side of it on the inside of the tub. Looked like it had been hit with a sledgehammer. 9. The toilet would barely flush. 10. Every corner in the room had the paint peeling off or worn off. 11. There was no deadbolt on the door. 12. When we turned on the air conditioner it sounded like a jet plane was landing in the room. We immediately called the front desk and requested to change rooms. We were told that engineering would have to check our a/c before they could move us. After a 45 min wait is when we discovered all the other things such as the outlets not working so we called and requested a manager. My friend spoke to Cynthia who informed her that we could come to the front desk and check out and get a refund. We couldn't get our bags together quickly enough to get out of that room. Once downstairs it took about 20 minutes to get someone to help us get checked out. My friend had paid for the room on her debit card and she requested something in writing showing that the full amount was going to be refunded. She called her bank and the charge had already gone through. She was given a piece of letterhead with an arrival and departure date but no amounts on it. When she asked for something with an amount on it she was told they were unable to do that. After informing the front desk person that we would not leave without such a paper he finally gave her a copy of a screenshot on his computer showing the amount. Supposedly the amount would be credited to her account within 24 hours. Almost 48 hours later it still hadn't been done so another call had to be made to a manager named Mark. Mark immediately called her bank and got the funds put back into her account. I know that this is a very lengthy review but I wanted other travelers to know that they shouldn't be fooled by pictures online or some of the other reviews that are out there. As I said before this was my first trip to NYC and I was very disappointed by how it started out. I was not expecting a 5 star hotel with 100s of amenities especially for the price we were paying. But I did expect a clean comfortable room that didn't make me fear for my health. Fortunately we were able to find another hotel but we were not lucky enough to find one in Manhattan like we wanted. I will post this review on every website including Hotel Pennsylvania's.,trav1288
UR23685174,2009-19-January,After a 25 hour flight from Australia we arrived in NYC late at night and were really tired. The staff were rude and didn't have any enthusiasm. The lobby was full and we had to wait for a long time to check in. The room we entered was extremely average. The bathroom was old and tired and so was the paint on the walls. The bed linen could definately do with an update. The internet in the lobby was quite expensive which was a shame. The service at the desk was very slow when we needed more towels so we had to ask a few times before someone came up. The only good thing was the locationthe room was cleaned daily and the lift was fast. We later went on to stay at the hotel elysees which was FANTASTIC so check it out if you are looking for a beautiful location great staff and a french home away from home.,PinkBlush
UR30242035,2009-18-May,This is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in and at the same time the most expensive I have ever stayed in. Not a good combination..... The staff is rude the place is worn out the rooms are dirty and the queue for checking in/out is huge. Try and go to the toilets in the reception area. It's like stepping straight in the heart of the Bronx. Truly unbelievable.,Brian_Rivera
UR49408926,2009-17-November,First: Checkin. Waited for over 1/2 hour to be told that I had to come back in 2 hours. Second time two hours later I waited for another hour in the line because there were only 2 employees checking people in. The first room they gave me had not yet been cleaned from previous guests. The second room was extremely small. Second: The Room. Ok so we were told that the lower level room were not worth staying in and that the "good" rooms were on the 11th and 12th floors. The first room they gave us was on the 11th floor. The hallways smelled musty and moldy with a hint of stale cigarrettes. Since they hadn't even cleaned the room yet the next room they gave us was on the 12th floor. The room was so small we could barely walk around the bed. The bathroom was outdated with old early 1900's black and white tiles the sink was about to fall off the wall and the tub looked like it hadn't been cleaned... ever. The room was also so hot that I felt like I was in an oven. We cranked up the "A/c" and went to explore the city with the friends we traveled with. When we got back to the room several hours later the room was like the inner santum of hell. Called and asked for someone to come look at the A/c. When the gentleman arrived we were told that the building doesn't have A/c only heat. We had to open the window (no screens) and try to get air in the room. Third: Maid Service. We were in this hotel for 2 nights. During that time the maids walked into my room without knocking so they could clean. Not once but TWICE! When I mentioned it to the front desk the gentleman behind the counter just shrugged. Lastly: The Staff. The staff at this hotel does not seem to care about anything. The only acception was one gentleman working at the Tours desk in the hotel lobby. He was friendly and helpful when I asked about transportation and the locations of places we wanted to visit. The only good point of this hotel is that it is local to everything in Midtown Manhattan. However there is no way I would ever stay at this hotel again. If you plan to go then good luck to you.,Lonil001
UR34982819,2009-17-July,Location was good. You walk in to the Reception and all looks fine. Rude woman at desk. Collect key to room up in grotty lift. Couldn't believe the room. Rusty air conditioning unit broken electrical socket plates and grimy bathroom. Our stay was shortly after the twin towers disaster. It looks as if little has improved since our stay. The date above is entered only because the review will not load otherwise. It is not the actual dates.,ArchitectAylesbury
UR32497372,2009-16-June,Being from Pennsylvania my mother and I make frequent trips into NYC for shopping and leisure. We have stayed many places and always are willing to try new hotels. Hotel Pennsylvania was possibly the worst we have ever encountered. First of all after spending the day in NYC we were eager to check in and get some rest. We stood in the check-in line for approx. 40 mins. So of course our experience did not begin well. After checking in we made our way to our room which ended up being a smoking room even though we had requested a non-smoking room. We asked for a room change which was fine. The air conditioning in our room was malfunctioning and continued a loud vibrating noise when turned on. So of course we were not able to sleep and had to turn it off. The next morning the water pressure in the shower was overpowering. It almost hurt definitely not a pleasant wake up. Finally after heading downstairs to check out we were told for them to keep our luggage while he spent the day in NYC we would have to go stand in the never ending check-in line to obtain luggage tags (they couldn't just get them for us) which by the way cost $4 a bag. Never in any of our stays in NYC have we had to pay a hotel (in which we were staying!) to hold our luggage. We also were responsible for taking our luggage to the holding room in the basement. Not exactly convenient. We are not picky people and for the most part can easily go with the flow. However we were extremely disappointed since Hotel PA is fairly well-known. Also we have stayed in hotels for 1/2 the price of Hotel PA and received hospitality and accomodation far superior to Hotel PA. One good thing...the location.,hw1103
UR23602152,2009-16-January,When we arrived at the hotel we thought what a great location everything you want is around you walked into the hotel lobby that was great also check in was easy and friendly then the nightmare begins after stepping out of the elevator i thought i was on the set of the shining (Stephen King Movie). The hotel looked not just old and in need of decoration but was a very unclean smell everywhere. We got to our room on the fifth floor and it was even worse the smell was terrible so obviously we complained and we carried cases back to reception i think they forget that some people had been on an 8 hour flight plus airports more like 12 hours to be messing around with dirty rooms we were given another room this time on the 10th floor and told we have upgraded you to a superior room - this was a little better as in bigger room but the smell of dirty carpets and general uncleanliness as the skirtings looked as if they had never been cleaned or painted since the hotel opened in 1936 but we were tired so we asked if they could send up some extra pillows to the room after 1 hour they never arrived so we rang down again they apologised and said they would send them up right away - that night they never arrived at all. As we were only staying 3 nights we decided to accept a bad decision to stay at this hotel. After staying in New York last year at the Jolly Madison Towers we were deeply disappointed with Hotel Pennsylvania and i hope you will remember this review in case you book because the pictures they portray on their site look nothing like the room you will be given i am sure.,Midiman111
UR37822219,2009-16-August,We stayed here as it was fairly cheap (well cheap for New York!) and was ideally located for Penn Station as well as Times Square & The Empire State Building. Upon arrival though it became apparent as to why it was cheaper than other alternatives. Firstly the foyer was bedlam! There were hundreds of people milling around and it was difficult to get anywhere near the check in. Once we did get to check in we were greeted by an incredibly rude receptionist who decided she didn't want to check us in and wandered off in a strop. After then waiting for a further 30 mins to check in we were finally dealt with (again in a fairly surly manner) & eventually got to our room. To say the room was dated would be an understatement and the hotel itself was scruffy in general. The amenities in the room were poor to be honest but as we were only in New York for 3 days we didn't spend much time there anyway. The room was quite noisy the bed needed throwing out 15 years before we got to it! And the bathroom was as old fashioned as it gets. When we left the room to see the sights we would regularily pass the cleaning staff who were a welcome change from the idiots on reception. They always greeted us with a smile & exchanged pleasantries. The coffee shop in the foyer was great & resonably priced. The same however could not be said for the onsite restaurant. Considering the USA bangs on about how great their food is this was possibly the worst restaurant on the planet! For 2 two course meals one glass of milk & a couple of Cokes we were charged $80+!!! They served Smash as "creamed potatoes" & the waitress took it upon herself to add her 18% tip to the bill anyway! It was terrible. Overall it's brilliantly located & Cheap for New York prices but I'm afraid that's all it has going for it.,Juicytravels
UR49288475,2009-15-November,The location of this hotel is perfect and that's about all that is perfect about it! If you have ever wanted to have the experiance of being in a movie then this hotel is for you! i turned the corner and was waiting for a red ball to come bouncing down the hall with 2 little creepy girls riding a bike or something! i think steven king filmed the shining here! my wife and i could have sworn we heard REDRUMREDRUM echoing through the halls! the room was about the size of a closet a desk (with a chair that was pretty much touching the bed chipped dirty walls scuffed all over a carpet that was paper thin and brown(we think it may have been white back in 1945) Decent price yes but come on! now i am not picky at all but this one really got me angry. When we checked in all was cool until the very nice man say's..you need credit card for $40 hold for any "charges" you may have( phone calls i guess) i didn't have a credit card and offered to pay cash for the deposit. He was very annoyed and kept insisting we use a credit card so it would be easier at check out. After explaining 12 times that we did not have a credit card he reluctanly took cash and "threw" it in the register and we were all set. No biggie he kindly reminded me to return the following day to retrive my $40 i said i would( who wouldn't get their money back) anyway my wife and i went to the metallica concert had a blast and returned to the room and had a good night's sleep. The next morning when we went to check out it started out fine we walked up handed the guy our room key and he did his thing. My wife mentioned that we had to get our car that the valet had parked the night before that's when all hell broke loose. My wife looks at the valet ticket and it say's $40 for parking! ummm what?? there was no mention of any "parking fee" before hand at any point! so where is this coming from? my wife went to the bell captain guy and i stood there waiting for my "deposit" that i had paid the night before the very annoying and rude guy who checked me out just ignored me and said "next guest please" i said umm excuse me but i left a deposit last night and i was told i was to pick it up today. The guy say's "you need your car right"? i said yeah and? he then tells me that $40 i left the night before was for parking! oh hell no are you kidding me? now we know why they wanted a credit card so they could charge for parking and who know's what else. The guy yells out really loud..."security" call security huh? for what? i had only asked to speak to a manager. So we leave to go get our car. Now the bell hop ask's where is your recipt? we are confused again and he say's ok well $40! another $40? i don't think so pal! he say's without your recipt that you stayed here and payed the $40 you will have to pay another $40! yeah right! we go back inside to get our recipt and the guy who just checked us out 10 minutes earlier claims he has no idea who i am and that he did not check me out! uh yeah you did jerf off! he screams again security! call security please! what the [--]?? we could not believe what was going on he tried to say he did not check me out and had never seen me before! what a nightmare. Since when does a hotel charge you for parking in their hotel when you are staying in their hotel? baffling to say the least! so in closing STAY REAL CLEAR OF THIS RAT HOLE! they are scam artist in every sense of the word! STAY AWAY FROM HOTEL PA!!!!!,steelersfan58
UR37739399,2009-15-August,New York was a destination i had wanted to go for many years so when my parents booked the trip in 2002 they wanted the experience to be one to remember!!!! And it was just that........ The location was perfect right across the road from Madison Sq Gardens adn within easy access of subways etc. After arriving on an long early morning flight all we wanted to do was freshen up and then sleep before beginning our holiday properly. After being greeted by a very rude receptionist we were taken to our rooms. The corridor made you feel you were in a old style gangster film (we were later told this floor had not be refurbished yet). After unpacking we decided to shower and sleep the sight in the bathroom quickly changed our minds. Mould and damp greeted us in the bathroom. The bottom of the showercurtain was black with mould and the room smelt musty. We decided just to call it a night the temp of the room kept fluctuating from ice cold to red hot making sleeping unbearable and if that was not bad enough we awoken at 5 in the morn by my youngest sister screaming their was something crawling in her bed. With my mum trying to calm her we checked her bed to find a HUGE coakroach!!! Yes a coakroach (we saw many other on our trip mainly in the corridors) netherless she refused to sleep in there afterwards. Lovely location but cant say much for the hotel,Travellin-Tottie
UR41533931,2009-14-September,My partner and I went to New York last year we booked a 4 night stay at the Pennsylvania. It was the first time we had been to New York so needless to say we were very very excited. We arrived at the hotel in the afternoon and as we walked in I instantly thought wow what a hotel it looked beautiful! We went straight to check in and we were seen very quickly which I was pleased with as when I read reviews I thought there would be a long wait. Everything was going well until we got to our room it was smalldark and dingy nothing like what we had seen on the website. The air conditioning made a noise which was annoying but luckily we could get past that but the room was so out dated and looked like it needed a good scrub. We had noticed our toilet was leaking and there was a puddle covering the bathroom floor so the next morning we went to the front desk to let someone know so they could fix it when we got back that evening it still hadn't been done again the next morning we went down and asked again about the toilet and still nothing was done all day every morning we repeated the same thing! The staff were not at all helpful they didnt really care which was disappointing. The day before we were due to go home me and my partner were sitting on the bed sorting out our itinerary for the day when I looked down and got the shock of my life there was a giant cockroach crawling up my leg that was the final straw we packed our stuff and went down to reception and demanded a new room we were reluctantly given a new room which to be honest wasn't much better than the first one but we dealt with it just because we were going home the next day From the outside and the lobby the hotel looks lovely but the rooms were horrible the staff were horrible and I would never stay there again. I was very disappointed overall if the staff had been friendlier and helpful and we didnt get a cockroach in the room we could have dealt with it as being in New York you don't tend to spend alot of time in the room anyway but we were just completely ignored. As i said the only good thing about this hotel is the location madison square garden opposite and everything is literally round the corner,MissyFanus
UR46775282,2009-13-October,Central to Penn Station Macys Koreatown but otherwise this part of midtown is a cultural desert. Times Square is relatively close. Hotel and lobby looks fine from outside. Rooms are a disappointment - small dim basic. I think they re-carpeted but the furnishings were old and the paint peeling. OK for a place to crash and shower but considering the price tag >$200 per night don't expect to much.,MarkHCapeTown
UR51173377,2009-13-December,since returning ive found some real horror stories about this hotel and i can well believe them. Our room wasn't as bad as some pictures on the internet. Our room was quite small the paint was flaking from the walls. The furniture was OK although only one person could watch the tv at a time because of its positioning. The central heater had a towel rammed in it - presume to stop a leak. The gorridor smelt of damp. The reception staff were very unfriendly the nicest staff were the bag drop people although we ad to pay for the experience - pay to leave our bags after check out ? Perhaps the wost hotel ever - probably not but its up there.... dont do it - find somewhere else.....,sim0n_and_lisa
UR26077216,2009-12-March,It started off waiting for ages to be checked in the girls behind reception were so rude and ignorant. The rooms were a disgrace paint coming off walls window would not open carpet dirty looking if this hotel was in ireland it would be closed down. To be honest we have better cow sheds in ireland. The cafe or whatever it is down in lobby (lindy's) was a rip off. Also be aware not to use prepaid callcards in the hotel rooms you will be charged and will receive a fine big bill. They did it to me i no all about it a total rip off. I hated the hotel and there were 4 others with me they also hated it. We all loved new york and will go back next year but not to the pennsylvania hotel. No way. . .,bernieo78
UR34561509,2009-12-July,We picked this hotel for its close location to Penn Station booking through the internet despite the numerous bad reviews in the hope that it wouldn't all be doom and gloom! On browsing the hotel website we decided to go for the Club 5000 option which gave us extra comfort and other complimentary items. We arrived at hotel early afternoon 3rd July expecting to see long queues in reception lobby. To our surprise there were only a few guests waiting to check-in and there was only a wait of about 10 minutes. We were allocated a room on the 11th floor which upon entering looked decidedly small for 2 adults and not what was described on the website. We initially thought that the room wasn't a Club 5000 but it was confirmed to us the following morning that it was! We also wanted to know about "complimentary" items described on website Club 5000 pages that we didn't have in our room. We were told that we would have to pay extra for those items! I thought that "complimentary" meant free with hotel compliments.......not likely at this hotel! If you wanted to have the complimentary breakfast your room key had to be updated but you weren't informed about this when checking-in. Sound-proofing between rooms leaves a lot to be desired especially at night when you are trying to sleep and a couple down the corridor are in are in the throes ecstacy....not that we were complaining mind you!! Our allocated room was away from front of hotel so there wasn't too much noise from the streets and we were able to get good nights' sleep. The Club 5000 lounge was something to be believed! It was just a small room on the 12 th floor - that was in need of decoration - with a few tables and chairs a TV and a couple of computer terminals. A small breakfast table was set up in a corner for the continental breakfast. Although the bedroom was very small it was relatively clean with fresh towels daily bathroom had been slightly updated with new sink and plumbing and the maid service was very efficient. The room size is not what you are led to believe on the website. It looks like a king-size bed had been put into a single room and that left no space for any chairs apart from computer chair. We found the hotel staff to be very friendly and helpful despite the fact that the hotel was exceptionally busy. Internet access is available in rooms at $10 per 24 hours. The hotel has a fantastic location for all New York's tourist attractions and gives you a basic level of accommodation. Be careful if you are thinking of booking Club 5000.......it's not what you are led to believe! The website is a bit misleading! Apart from that we had a very enjoyable 5 day stay.,Nuttyal
UR23481114,2009-12-January,OK ill get straight to the point. The bad things; 1. The line to check in was terrible (about 200 people) & only 2 staff on the desk. A joke considering it was christmas holidays. 2. Staff were rude (but you would expect that from people in NYC) 3. Beds were like concrete. You wouldnt of been able to drill a hole through it as ith was that hard. I would have slept better out on the sidewalk in -5 degrees. 4. Too bloody noisy. The walls were as thin as tissue paper & can hear every bit of noise from on the street or from the people next door. (even if ur on the 19th floor). 5. definantly not worth $290 a night. That was a joke! The good things; 1.Location was fantastic 2.The showers were good & the toilets actually flushed properly unlike most hotels in the US.,Sexytraveller2
UR27883229,2009-12-April,We stayed at this hotel because of the location and price but found out that no price is worth the horror we encountered . The lobby was beautiful and for a moment we entertained some hope but then we saw the long lobby line and five service stations with only one attendant present. While waiting in line I saw a sign that said that portable smoking dectors were available but did not quite understand why they were being offered and dared to think the best. After an interminably long wait we finally got our keys and went up to our room. The hallways were shabby and dirty and the doors all looked like they neede to be changed. My mouth fell open when I saw the sparsley decorated dull and dingy room and I felt dirty just standing inside it. I tseemed like someone had taken out all the furniture and just left the bare disgusting necessities. The shelf holding the TV was falling apart the refridgerator had a big hole in the back of it and did not work the bath looke dgreasy and the toilet did not flush at the end of the night. At around 10:30 pm one of the staff tried opening our door with a key without knocking and replied that she was just checking the rooms when I questioned her unannounced entry. We stayed in the city until we could no longer walk just to be able to stay away from that disgusting place then left by 8:30 the next morning even though we had a 12 pm flight. The location was great but not worth the disgusting interior.,princessdeb
UR48984192,2009-11-November,The poor reviews are true and deserved. This isn't a hotel as such I've stayed in better hostels and the experience of staying here is quite simply bizarre; from the weird roped off line system at reception to the presence of big burly security men checking your room key as you get onto the elevator - I guess that didn't bode too well. The lobby is huge impersonal and chaotic. As I walked around in a peculiar daze i wondered if everyone else was hating it as much as I was. I felt like I'd been transported straight back into 1980s New York think Michael Jackson's 'BAD' - an era the rest of the city has long left behind. The room was worse; dirty dank and depressing... i won't go on the other reviews and user photos sum it up.,dandizette
UR29791221,2009-11-May,Do not be deceived by the website. This hotel was aweful. Looks like never renovated. Thought we were entering an Alfred Hitchcock movie. Moved to 4 different rooms. Wanted to relocate but child was there with a school group so really had to stay. Bought flip flops for shower.,NewYorkGirlTrip
UR34453247,2009-11-July,I think part of the hotell is refurnished and we where staying in the old part and that is why the revieuws are so different. Our room was very spacious but dirty. The bathroom was not clean and dust was piled up in the corners and on top of for example the closets (had to check how thorough they cleaned). The TV had just a vieuw channels working the hairdryer didn't work but this was fixed quickly. We where not much in the hotel and where aware of the poor quality thanks to the revieuws so we weren't dissapointment and we gor a good price. But for full price you can get much better for your money. (booked hotel 373 on fifth avenue for the same price as this hotel),salsaddictNorway
UR46442624,2009-10-October,I needed to make a quick business trip to NYC and chose the Hotel Pennsylvania because of the location across from Penn Station. While on the surface it looks like a full-service hotel don't expect much. Check-in on a Tuesday with only four people ahead of me in line was a 25 -minute wait. My room was dismal - very dark (no lighting except for a dim bedside lamp) and unrenovated with a cramped bathroom with cracked walls and peeling paint. There was a refrigerator which I did appreciate. The internet access (not wireless) was not working but calls to get help were met with answering machines and no returned calls so I was forced to walk elsewhere for internet access to get some work done. The lobby is clean and gives the appearance of an updated bustling hotel and I did feel safe there. Location is the best thing this hotel has to offer but if you are looking for even a decent room and amenities look elsewhere. For the same rates you can do better even in NYC.,japansports
UR45610803,2009-1-October,This hotel must be close for sanitary reasons. I was bitten by bed bugs all over my body and apparently it is not the first time it happens... The room was dirty and smelly and the service is terrible. It is true that it is well located but I'd rather stay in a well located metro station than in this hotel for sure it'd be cleaner and safer.,ESCSpain
UR29154071,2009-1-May,The pros: 1)the location can't be beat. close to theatre district chelsea penn station. 2) the price (I paid 60 per night on Last minute travel) can't be beat. If I paid 85 or more I might be pissed 3) The beds are comfortable. 4) The rooms are clean except as noted below. The cons 1) the check in line can be long --there are 1705 rooms and 2 or 3 check in people 2) the first room I had was clean but had a layer of dust under the tv. I switched rooms and this problem did not excist in the second room 3) the ceiling paint was peeling in the first room. This was not the case in the seconde room 4) Climate control seems to be an ongoing problem.based on other comments. You leave the window open.. it was bearable. 5) The hair dryer was broken; The internet thingy needed batteries. 6) This hotel is in need of major major rennovation The bottom line> if you want to save bucks and be in a great location in an acceptable (hotel. this is a great choice. Just don't expect the Hilton . It is a run down bargain but acceptable hotel. and for the price i would stay there again But for 55 per night at this location this hotel is a deal. I wouldn't pay more than 90 for a room here. Then it is not worth it.,dgoldyn
UR50445886,2009-1-December,I work in the hotel industry and this is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. Picked it becauce I was arriving into Penn Station at 2:30 am and it is across the street. I paid over $200.00 on Expedia and it's a dump. The paint was peeling on the door there were black hairs on the bathroom floor and there were staples on the carpet. Yet the lobby was full of people checking out in the morning. There is a Club Penn floor so maybe that's where the "good" rooms were. You had to pay to use the internet and printing and the restaurant's price were expensive. Went to McDonalds down the street and then grapped a Timmys from the store just outside the front entrance.,BumbleBea9
UR27215906,2009-1-April,Luckily I only stayed here one night couldn't wait to leave. Waited in line 45min to get checked in by extremely rude front desk person with no smile no friendliness and no apology for the wait. The hotel smelled old and stale. The Pennsylvania was the only hotel in which i have ever stayed where all the doors to the rooms slam shut every other door in every other hotel has a closing mechanism. I could hear doors slamming all the way up the corridor- not the way to get a good night's sleep! Only good thing was the location.,Barney_G_09
UR21673141,2008-9-November,this hotel has to be the worst i have ever stayed in. myself and three friends went for some shopping for six days. i know that most hotels in the states are basic but this was down right dirty. it was filthy and the staff were appalling. i was afraid to walk on the carpet it was so dirty. there was no stopper in the bath and it was cracked and peeling.the corridor was frightening. it was quite scary as there was no one checking the lift. anyone could come up to the corridor. myself and one friend had to travel a day earlier as we were airline staff and the flights were better that day so we had to do a separate booking for one night.well that was so confusing for the staff but they gave us a room which because of my airline i.d. they saId was an upgrade.well what a joke that was it was on the third floor and we since found ou that the first three floors are rented by the hour that says it all. there was no head boards on the beds the t.v. unit was falling apart and it felt as if the room had not been cleaned in years. this hotel was not cheap we paid 2500 euros and i paid 215 dollars for the extra night. we had friends staying in the new yorker and they had a suite for the same price and there was no comparison living room 2 ensuites an ironing room and plasma television. needlless to say we wont be going back again and i will be telling everyone i know to give it a wide berth. thanking you gerardine kiernan,ruler8
UR15860364,2008-9-May,Just returned from a 3 night stay in this property and it is a dump. Had room on 4th floor very dark and dingy bathroom disgusting. Looked like it hadnt been cleaned for months. Check-in a joke too had to wait 2 hrs for room to be ready and the had to queue for 30 minutes to check out. Good location but other than that no positives. Stuck in a time warp.,clairel29
UR15792055,2008-8-May,After reading comments on tripadvisor we've decided to take a chance on this hotel... and most reviews on this website are actually quite true. We could not believe it when we checked in the lobby looked so nice so we were hoping that the room might be ok despite the bad reviews about the room but it was really as bad as they say. We asked to changed the room but the next room really wasn't much better. the doors on the inside were falling off the paint were peeling off. The room we ended up taking was a non smoking room and if you're not a smoker you should request a non smoking room as it was a little bit better. The location is fantastic so I guess for the price you pay you can't expect much. ( We didn't expect much but we were still horrified!) Anyway if you are at all abit fussy or expect a normal room in good condition i wouldn't recommend it but if you don't mind about the room and the fact that you may come across some mice you'd be ok here. ( we had mice in our room) Even the more deluxe room really wans't much better but it was about $100 more per night. Good location but that's it.,BlaineandAimee
UR20688841,2008-7-October,I booked this hotel as it was the only one I could find at a reasonable price ($299 per night) as all others I was looking at were around $400-$500 per night. We arrived at around 11am and had no problems checking in and were able to get to our room straight away which was on the 5th floor. However the room was horrible. It just seemed old and dirty with stained carpets and filthy walls. The bathroom was grotty and disgusting with peeling paint and wasn't helped by the fact that it didn't appear to get cleaned the whole time we were there (4 nights). The only good thing was that we had a room at the end of a corridor and it was pretty big especially for a NY hotel room and there was a good view of the Empire State Building that we could just make out through the filthy windows. In fact it was so bad that although we had booked for 6 nights we moved after 4 when we found a special deal at the Millennium Broadway for $199 for an upgraded room (this hotel was lovely and we had an amazing room on the 50th floor). I would never stay in the Penn Hotel again and I would never recommend it to anyone.,stickyricelondon
UR21639022,2008-7-November,It was one of the worst experiences ever. The room was dirty noisy and dark. The staff was rude. It definitely does not worth the price Too expensive for what we get. Will never ever come back to this pigsty.,RoxanaMexicoDF
UR14116637,2008-7-March,I had to attend a conference in NYC and for the 1st time left arranging my hotel to a travel agency. This was easily the filthiest most run-down unsafe and uncomfortable stay in any hotel in my life. The door to my room would not lock properly so I asked and was moved (hours later) to another equally disgusting room. The last renovation of this place had to be in the early seventies. Granted there are hundreds of rooms but the peeling paint the soggy saggy mattresses the broken fixtures and the utter filth have no place in a hotel that charges over a hundred dollars a night. Thankfully I was in meetings all day every day and returned so tired I did not mind the stained blankets and torn sheets. The carpeting was threadbare and had hair and bits of dirt. The moldy rusted tub was so disgusting (there was hair in the tub too) that I just squatted and sprayed with water to clean off. I have been in cheap tourist hotels in Turkey Mongolia and China but this takes the cake. I just read the "Dirtiest Hotel" feature and this hotel should be a runner-up!,NorthChicagoCouple
UR13352143,2008-7-February,oh my god you're given a card which won't open the door and at the 3rd time you finally get to your room with a lot of surprises such as: you reserved for a king bed but you get a double bed...without any explanation of course cannot use the electricity plugs cannot stop the water and find a huge cockroach having a walk in the bathroom. + the people at the desk are quite incompetent and if you wanna let your luggage after the check out you are charged 4 bucks a bag. Thank you! better take anything near from a subway station...,kataract
UR17585068,2008-6-July,We stayed in the Penn for 3 nights. The location is great the rooms are below basic meaning basic amenities are there (like private bathroom) but they are of such poor quality no hotel could offer this to its guests. We had large gaps in the bath for example. We booked this hotel because we thought we wouldn't be there much. But we underestimated the fact that after a long day of walking it is nice to have a place to rest. We paid Eur 170 per night.,Dutchgirl999
UR22489844,2008-6-December,My friends and I stayed in this hotel last year - our rooms overlooked madison square gardens. The bedrooms had single pane glass - the room was freezing and unbearably loud but the strangest and most inconvenient thing was that the bathroom (from which you could wave into the well illuminated office block across the road) did`nt have any curtains/ blinds - I was informed by housekeeping that they did`nt see a problem with this and consequently spent our time anxiously taping towels to the huge window - we could even clearly identify our window with towels from street level. The hygiene of this establishment is very questionable. Lights did`nt work the carpets were filthy and the place smelled disgusting. The shower head was broken and sprayed water onto the light switch - wardrobe doors would`nt open - in short avoid this hotel at all costs. Booking in took an hour of standing in a queue. We could`nt say a single positive thing about this hotel and found ourselves dreading returning to the hotel at night. Yes I know New York is expensive and some would argue its such a 24 hour city you only need a bed to crash for a few hours - but this hotel is a waste of your money time and will put a huge downer on your trip - avoid avoid avoid. Beth,beth25
UR18669145,2008-6-August,Hotel looks very good on it's own website and is reported to be one of the top hotels in New York for high standards. After staying at this hotel for 4 nights I would certainly not recommend it at it's present condition. The arrival was totally inadequate and on arrival from a 8 hour flight it took us 35 minutes to check in waiting in a long queue with only 2 staff serving but another 3 walking around behind the reception not assisting. No assistance offered with cases. The room was only what I can say is in a time warp and I expected al Capone to come out of the wardrobe! The shower area was disgraceful and general hygiene was poor. The windows were that filthy you could not see out of them and blocked light from entering room. We asked for extra pillows and it took 2 days after recontacting room service. The toilets in the receptoin area shouldnot have been left opened to anybody they were a health hazzard the smell was unbelievable we did report it but nothing ever got done. I appreciate this hotel gets busy but it's no excuse to treat clients like cattle or infact it could have been a remake of the immigration centre on Ellis Island the way people were handled. The only good thing about it was the location was ideal for midtown but not for a ggod accomodation experience. This Hotel need serious attention but I doubt it would ever be affordable to refurbish however it does'nt cost musc for good customer service. We have been to New York several times and I would recommend to anyone if it's budget then use budget hotels they will be more pleasing than 4* hotels especially Penn Hotel.,fercoll
UR14830742,2008-6-April,My best friend and I visited the hotel in September 2007. We had decided to book this hotel due to the website and the photos on the site all I can say is I don`t know where the photos were of but I guarantee it`s not where you will be sleeping !! My friend rang home and cried for at least 30 minutes!! The hotel is decorated in a dreadful Dark Green which does nothing to cheer up the out of date rooms. The corridors look like something out of the Munsters !! Our Heater and most worryingly our door lock did not work the bathroom had seen better days and the enamel was coming off which turned your bath water a filthy brown colour. HOWEVER................. The location of the hotel was excellent. A couple of blocks from the Empire State Building Macys Times Square and opposite Madison Square Gardens. The staff were all very friendly and we had a good joke with the guys in the luggage room they thought us 2 girls were very funny trying to fit all of our purchases into our cases! If you go not expecting much room wise you will be Ok the location does soften the blow of the trauma of the hotel.,pinkfairygirl13
UR15682101,2008-5-May,Myself and 3 others were booked in here last week. The first night however there were only two in our party and then we were going to be joined by two other guests for the remaining 2 nights. This is not a bargain hotel. The first day I arrived at 1 o clock. We were told to wait until 3 o clock to check in. By that time the line was like something you would find at disneyland. For these two hours we were told we could store each bag for $4 per bag. Then finally after lining up for about 45 minutes we got our room. It was satisfactory. Next morning we were being joined by the other two in our party (and getting a large double room for the 4 of us) so this meant we had to check out in the morning and re checkin again at 3 o clock (the same story as previous day - long lines 45 minutes wait again). Then we had to pay another $4 per bag fee to allow us to leave the hotel for the day and not waste more time. Most hotels would be fairly accomodating in a situation like this. NOT this one. Avoid this place like the plague unless you want to waste endless amounts of time on a short trip like I had. Im not a complainer and Im generally easily satisfied where accomodation is concerned and Ive never taken the time to write a review like this before as Ive never had good enough reason. But this place sucked. AVOID AVOID AVOID,Helentherealist
UR18640173,2008-5-August,Having read the reviews I was more than interested to stay at this hotel. It was as bad as everyone had written. We arrived at 11.00 p.m. and still had to wait 15 mins to check in. The receptionists were unhelpful we had sent 3 emails requesting twin beds and never got a reply until after we had arrived there. They only had a room with a double bed which was really small. The corridor to the room was dull and dinghy and we approached the room with intrepidation. It was all in dark brown and off white. There was a large hole near the air conditioning unit. The bathrom was small with just a shower. The sheets and towels were clean and changed each day. As we were on the back we thought it would be quiet. It was until 5.00 a.m. when 4 very large air conditioning outlets on the roof of the building next door came to life. It was like trying to sleep next to a jet engine. They said that they would be taking 75$ per night from our credit card for incidentals and if we didn't have any it would be credited back to our account in about a weeks time. What incidentals. The phone didn't work and there wasn't a mini bar or fridge. Actually they didn't take anything. On checking out we asked if we could put our cases into the luggage room. Yes but at a cost 4$ a case. The hotel is situated very central and you could walk to Times Square etc.,Doreen8
UR16663239,2008-4-June,Just returned from a fantastic trip to New York during our stay we had booked 2 nights in the Pennysylvania Hotel we arrived and waited ages to book in. We had booked 2 rooms and they sent us up to the 14th floor when we got of the lift the corridor was very dark and quiet scary the doors to the rooms were like something from a horror movie. The rooms were filthy the carpet was dark brown and looked as if it had a life of it's own.Next there was a knock and the door and there was a man with an exterminator kit strapped to his back he wanted to spray the room. We picked up our bags and left. When we complained they offered us 2 different rooms these were not as bad but we counld not stay so we returned to New Jersey to the lovely hotel we had stayed in for our first 3 nights,emmajanedublin
UR17538638,2008-4-July,Budget is the best way to describe this hotel. You get what you pay for. Arrived after a long flight and had to queue 30 minutes to check in. Our Hotel bedroom was stinking of cigarette smoke. It was so bad it would catch in your throat. Room was dark small and grim. Bathroom was desperate. Our wash hand basin was loose and there was a pubic hair in our bathtub. I asked for another room and was informed there were none available as it was thanksgiving weekend...... having said all that my friend was staying in a room a couple of floors above me and it was like it was in a different hotel. Large room fresh decor and they even had bathrobes guess we were just unlucky. Hotel interior asides the location was excellent directly opposite MSG five minutes from Macys. I definately wouldnt stay again. Happy to pay more for a better standard of hotel.,travelgirlkk
UR12338379,2008-4-January,Was very apprehensive about going to the hotel after reading the reviews on here but the actual experience wasn't half as bad. The hotel is very basic. It's in drastic need of a makeover and the overall feel is dowdy and neglected. The worst part of the stay was the one hour wait at reception when we arrived but otherwise nothing horrendous happened. The room was on the 14th floor. It was quite small and dull. However my main relief was that the bed linen was clean and so was the bathroom (although a little mouldy in places). The sheets were replaced daily and the room was also cleaned on a daily basis. The bed was a little springy but was sleepable. The main advantage is the location which is FANTASTIC. You are literally in the middle of it all - you can't ask for better. We only ever stayed in the hotel to sleep so weren't bothered about the amenities etc. If you want a clean but very basic accommodation then stay here. If you want the Ritz go elsewhere.,valleyboy82
UR13248433,2008-4-February,Near a subway! Across from from the Garden ten blocks from time square all for $260. It must be to good to be true. WELL it was!!!! This place is horrid. The hotel rooms are small and my room faced a brick wall. I stayed in what was considered a "dump" in Santa Barabara for less and had a bigger room and bathroom. The smell was bad too. The maid service and the overall staff of the hotel do carry the typical NYC attitude like they are there by force and when you need or ask for help you get eyes rolled at you. IT might be the fact that there are litterally hundreds of europeans running around in the hotel. The internet service is bad. They block all wireless internet access within the hotel range so your internet on your cell phone wont work. THey force you to go to the lobbyand use a pay per minute interenet that always seems to be used by the European tourist looking up European news. The hotel also overcharged me $100 plus they never responded to my email about their service. Hotel.com was great in fixing the problem they immediately refunded my money and sent me a voucher so I could use their services again. Like my title says unless you are desperate and need a place to sleep and you wont really remember the experience. Pay the extra cash and stay at a Hilton or the W.,mdrj69
UR21423412,2008-31-October,What a dump I have never in all my life stayed in such a filthty dirty grubby hotel. My husband had book a trip to New York for my 40th birthday and had book this hotel through Aerlingushotels thinking it would be ok because Aerlingus was a well known company. Avoid this hotel the corridors are like something you would see in a horror movie. This whole hotel needs to be pulled down and rebuilt it was so old and dirty. There was a smell of dirty dogs and stale smoke in our room. I can't go on anymore it is just an absolute dump.,helbabe
UR17370252,2008-30-June,I stayed at this hotel on 12th June 2008 and really wished I hadn't bothered especially as it cost me 150/nearly US$300! We waited 40mins just to check in. There is a serious lack of staff. The room was filthy and smelt of smoke even though it was a non-smoking room. The bathroom was so old and had paint peeling off the ceiling above the shower. My financee and I didn't use the shower it was cleaner not to wash. Lighting in the rooms is very poor and the ac is so old and noisy. Location is the only good thing about this hotel as it's right opposite Madison Square Gardens Macy's and the Empire States. I'm glad that I only stayed here for 1 night. At 150 a night it's a rip off.,AD76
UR22424726,2008-3-December,This hotel was located very nicely and that prompted us to choose it for our vacation in NYC. big mistake!! besides the location NOTHING else about it was worth it.. Rude lobby staffdirtysmall rooms with small dingy bathrooms.. Showers that did not workno Internet facilityeven if we were willing to pay for it! There are many other hotels which are in the same neighborhood and are much better avoid this!,Vida_V
UR18572661,2008-3-August,Overpriced and completely not worth the trouble. I had to stay for one night in NYC. Check -in took about 20 minutes. The attendant was very rude to my travel partner and I. As we were talking she decided to interject herself into our conversation. The room was very small. The comforter had burn marks. The bathroom was dirty. When we called for extra towels they never came. After being told my check-out time was at 1PM we were rudely called in the morning and asked when we were leaving. I would never recommend this place to anyone. If you have to stay someone for one night and/or longer look for some other place. Not worth the money I spent. I have stayed at roadside motels that were cleaner nicer and with a friendlier staff. I feel sorry for anyone who stays more than one night as their vacation.,phillyguy2580
UR14756141,2008-3-April,Right from the beginning The Hotel Pennsylvania was a dissapointment. We reserved our booking 2 months in advance over the internet as we live in Australia. When we arrive (after an exhausting 13 hour flight from Tokyo) we're told they gave our non smoking king room to someone else because of our late arrival. Thanks to the "Shuttle Bus Ride from HELL" from the airport we were late by less than 10 minutes. When we walked into our room our Non Smoking Room REAKED of stale cigarette smoke the "clean" towels were stained with some kind of yellow substance and there were cigarette burns on my sheets. All I expect in any hotel room regardless of the price is a clean room with clean linen & they couldnt even get that right. Absolutely Appalling,OnieG
UR13924590,2008-29-February,how does this hotel get away with it? busy reception not very helpful staff and a room for 3 that was terrible. My wife opened the door of the room and it stunk!! the cause we found was the black mil dew on the inside of the fridge door that had been left open. The bath room walls were black with dirt. we went back to reception complained and was taken to another room. Surprise we opened the door and it had not been made up Back to reception and another room on the 10th floor. a bit better but the floor hadn't been swept in months toe nail clippings and bits of cotton wool every where. Stopped 1 night and then moved on.,tiredoutUk
UR18360554,2008-28-July,We booked this hotel and then read the reviews online....mistake....but we figured "well how bad can it be?" As others wrote waited at least 45 minutes in line to check in. Our room seemed small ("superior" room) and was very dark--bathroom seemed relatively clean but shower was missing part of knob and some wood was missing/rotted. Shower head is only 5 feet high so if you are tall--difficult to shower. Mold or something similar to it in room caused allergic reaction by second night. Room was not very well dusted especially things higher than eye level. We used the valet parking and discovered that their "$40/day" rate does not mean "24 hours"--it means that once parked you cannot take it out without paying another $40 even if you take your car out after only 2 hours AND their "day" starts at 12:01 a.m. so even if you are only there for 2 nights you will get charged for 3 days of parking. We were given mis-information about all of this by the bellhop desk and their web site does not say they have a "no ion and out policy"--you are just supposed to figure this out--and you will once you get your bill!!! Front desk manager--horrible! They do not care about customer satisfaction at all!,charlotteRochester
UR20422880,2008-27-September,This is without doubt one of the most over-priced terrible hotels in New York City. It is badly in need of a renovation or at least a thorough cleaning. The service is surly the front desk under-staffed the food overpriced and terrible. And the "Penn 5000" VIP floor for which you pay a premium price is ridiculous. The free continental breakfast consisted of a few pieces of fruit some muffins and bagels and coffee served within a sparse room they call their VIP Lounge. I will never stay here again and I highly recommend that you avoid this hotel.,mdh311
UR14578671,2008-27-March,I stayed in this hotel for 6 nights in March 08 and would not recommend this to anyone. After lining up for 20 minutes to check in the receptionist told us in broken English that the rate we had booked our hotel (through hotel-rates.com) was not applicable and our stay would cost us an additional $20/30 a night. This was despite us having a booking confirmation in front of us with the confirmed price. They tried to explain that an AAA (discount) rate was given to us on the website when booking and as we were not american residents and didnt have a AAA card that we couldnt qualify for the discount. This was despite the fact that our address and country of origin was asked for before booking and no warning was given to this potential increase. The receptionist dissapeared for a minute and returned with our new price scribbled on a piece of paper in pencil which made this feel very suspect. It was easter week and we had no choice but to pay it but we felt very duped. Apart from this the hair dryer in the room did not work and hotel bar was a complete dive. The lobby was like a train station with constant lines at reception and school tours everywhere you look. The only thing going for this hotel was its location nothing else.,Nelly83
UR18325649,2008-27-July,I stayed in this hotel with my husband and our 3 year old daughter. We are frequent guests to NYC and since this hotel is in the short distance to all attractions we always booked it. However last time we stayed in we were robed by a maid. Nasty [--] took $4000 US from my purse when we were enjoying Christmas concert in Radio City. When we came back to the hotel after the concert I noticed that the room was cleaned second time so I decided to check all my purses and suitcases. At that time I discovered that money were stolen. When I ran downstairs to complain the security guy did not even care I was advised to wait till the morning. We had to call the cops but they said to forget about our money. Next day a manager on a duty told us that it happens very frequently here and we are not the first one being robed. I could not stop but wonder did I come to the third world country? Unfortunately that was a day when NYC lost its glamor in my eyes. So if you are looking for a cheap deal do not come to this hotel. It doesn`t worth it. I could be reached by e-mail at: oxana142003@yahoo.com,RoxyN
UR13031814,2008-27-January,We are big fans of New York and frequent visitors. We stayed at the Penn a couple of times in the past and to be honest we thought it was'n too bad they were cheap rooms. So this time we booked an upgrade thinking this would be an improvement as you really can't beat the location. There were 6 of us in total so we booked 3 rooms. The rooms (on the 12th floor) appeared clean but they were incredibly small. They didn't look much different considering they were upgraded rooms. Over the course of our stay we had a dog next door (pet friendly hotel I guess this explains the stains on the carpets) constantly barking.. My sister & aunt had to be moved 4 times in total as they also had dog in the next room. Each room worse then the last and all the while hotel staff displaying their obvious annoyance and impatience with them for complaining. One room had a hole in the bathroom wall where the water just poured out into the bath. It really was horrendous. While my husband & I were waiting for the dog next door to be moved (the reception said the guest's must have sneaked the dog in as pets were only allowed on floor's 2 and 3) another guest on the same floor was checking out as she had a MOUSE in her BED!! I found the staff in the hotel extremely rude and unhelpful. Their reaction to the mice was 'this is New York City you get mice everywhere' This hotel appear's cheap but we paid $1700.00 for 6 nights so it wasn't cheap. The hotel facilities are very poor. Long creepy & smelly corridors. The lobby was home to groups of homeless people every night. The rooms are shabby to say the least. Full of old oversized furniture and discusting carpets curtains. I cannot begin to explain how bad the bathrooms are. Trust me although this hotel is in a perfect location it's a serious hygiene compromise a big NO NO!!!!,ange284
UR16413689,2008-26-May,We booked this hotel through an "American holiday specialist" local travel agency. Although the travel agent herself admitted she had never stayed there (I assume they were getting a good profit margin from booking customers here). She said and I quote "The hotel's not important as it's not as if you're going to be spending much time there" those words came back to haunt me during the whole miserable time I spent at the Penn. We arrived after a long tiring trip from UK and had to wait in a long line for over 30 minutes to check-in. When we finally got to our room it was filthy and the room literally stank of cigarette smoke. I was shocked at the state of the bathroom which was filthy too. We'd booked and asked at check-in for a non-smoking room and this clearly wasn't non-smoking. We went downstairs to reception and queued up again for another 20 mins to get another room. This was as bad as the first plus the bath taps were running constantly (not a drip but actually running) and the toilet seat was snapped in half and unusable. But it did have a fridge (more on this later) To be honest with the tiredness and stress I sat on the stained bed cover and cried tears of frustration and disbelief. I finally gee'd myself up and went downstairs again for yet another wait this time of about 15 minutes and requested yet another room. I spotted some other people actually noisly demanding a refund on their booking and leaving the hotel to stay elsewhere. I was planning to do that myself if the 3rd room was no good. The 3rd room was acceptable (just about) and at my GF's suggestion as we still had the keys to the 2nd room we manhandled the fridge to the 3rd room. The Asian lady tourist in the lift looked surprised as we shuffled into the lift with the fridge and she said "I take towels but never a fridge!". We stayed 3 nights and our room window faced a brickwall and overlooked an area where the garbage dumpsters were kept. The room was warmish (March in NY is cool in the evenings) and ok but very small the fridge was useful as the hotel doesn't do food. The fixtures and fittings were tired and worn out or broken. The carpets were threadbare and filthy. The location is good but to be honest it's not worth it stay elsewhere. This hotel really spoilt our holiday in New York we dreaded returning to it at the end of the day. Next time I'd spend a lot more and get somewhere nice. After NY we got a hire car and drove East to the Pocono's and stayed at a bog standard HoJo in comparison it was the height of luxury and utter bliss so much so we stayed an extra night. Needless to say the "expert" travel agent hadn't booked that hotel for us... Finally regarding the Penn "just say NO!" PS I hope that in the 5 years since I was there that it has had millions of dollars spent on it in a complete rejunvenation and is now wonderful - somehow I think that's unlikely.,Gutan
UR13010286,2008-26-January,This was teh most horrific place I have ever stayed. The reception looked good but when we got to our 1st room it had a stain on the floor that looked like blodd stank of smoke and the curtiains were hanging on...so we changed room the floor was not stained but the bathroom was vile. Thank good we was in New York so spent all our time out and about we literally on used the room to sleep in. The location is great but not worth staying in a for the location. Disgusting!,SpencerTW13
UR13863641,2008-26-February,There was dangerous black mold on the ceiling the tv remote and radio were broken the heat and air conditioner didn't work (luckily it was good weather and we could open the window) and there wre not towels. They refused to change our room telling us the hotel was filled - we later found out that we were THE ONLY PEOPLE IN THE WING ON OUR FLOOR that night!!! All the other rooms were empty. They brought towels after 3 hours and multiple calls and fixed the radio but we were forced to spend 3 days in a room with dangerous black mold no tv and the window open all night.,SalmagundiTraveler
UR17217687,2008-25-June,Like a few others we had a great sense of trepidation about the hotel from previous reviews read. The first thing to say is that the location is just outstanding. We travelled by train from Boston on a swelteringly hot day so to just come out of Penn Station and cross the road to the hotel was a God-send. The hotel has a rather grand entrance which probably gives a false feel to the rest of what you could expect. Check-in though busy was friendly and efficient. It's when you're getting to the rooms that the dated feel of the hotel hits you. The cleaning staff do their best to keep up given the size of the place. It's obvious that the owners aren't prepared to spend anything on updating it. We understand that there are proposals for demolition but the zoning laws might prohibit this and don't expect any radical overhaul. The room was sparse generally clean but don't touch the curtains with a barge pole! bed fairly comfortable and the air conditioning worked (thankfully given the heat). As we only had a 2 day stay the hotel was just about adequate for our needs i.e. a comfy enough bed and a bathroom. Pricewise it was expensive for what you got (we stayed in 4 and 3 star hotels in Boston Philidelphia and Washington DC for less) but they get away with it as it's Manhattan and it's that location thing which will attract people in the first place. It's this that's the real sell as the location for getting around Manhattan is outstanding (e.g. Penn Station 30 second jog Times Square 5 mins Empire State 2 mins Macys 1 min). If you're wanting something a bit more upmarket then look elsewhere (we certainly will in future) but if it's location and just a place to crash then this will do it for you..,mikeandlynne
UR15338792,2008-25-April,Having flown from Barranquilla in Colombia where I had a beautiful suite with five rooms for less than USD200 this dive was a shock to the system. The lobby which is huge looks like an underground station with all sorts of undesirables hanging around. Check-in was quite efficient which was good as I didn't want to hang around there longer than I had to. Just before the lifts is a rope barrier and signs saying 'No alcohol beyond this point'. Nice. The room was absolutely awful - dark dingy filthy carpets and bits of the wall crumbling on to the floor. Food in one of the restaurants was OK but no more than that and vastly overpriced even by UK standards. At most times of the day the pillars in the lobby were surrounded by vast noisy groups of schoolkids with backpacks on reinforcing the feel of a station. The location is good - you step out of the front door and are in central Manhattan but the hotel itself? One of the worst I have stayed in. They should rename it the Pennsylvania Youth Hostel and charge $25 a night.,dumelarra
UR22146277,2008-24-November,Rude and arrogant front desk staf. When we flush the toilett water came out on the floor. Bath tub filling up with dirty water from the sour when guest next door taking a shower. They didnt offer us a new room and they couldnt fix the problem. But the worst was the arrogant behavior from the front desk staf. This hotel must have new guests all the time. I can not imagin that a previous guest ever goes back.,Swed9
UR13817277,2008-24-February,I stayed here with my school group after our travel company mucked up our flights back home- we had been staying in Vermont for the week in what at the time seemed to be far from luxury until we arrived at this place! On arrival the lobby was quite grand very large and bustling- just as one would expect from the pictures on their website. We were greeted by some 'less than friendly' staff and took the packed lift up to the 3rd floor. Our suitcases were being unloaded on to patches of vomit which coated the carpet and that the cleaners had obviously failed to notice. The porters must have been blind and had no sense of smell not to notice where they were putting our suitcases! The hotel was vast and our group were staying at opposite ends of the corridor- a good 5 minutes walk away despite being on the same floor. The doors made the place look like a prison. Our group of girls obviously drew the short straw; our bathroom stank of urine was filthy the bath was cracked mouldy and rotting the taps didn't work properly the room was not designed to fit 4 people and we struggled to fit in with our suitcases the lights didn't work- constantly flickering our view was of a brick wall accompanied by some large bins and it was absolutely freezing. However the boys did at least get a large room and were near eachother with views of madison square gardens- this has led me to think that the people who seem to be writing good reviews of this dump have stayed in the less shabby rooms (which are by no means acceptable) but at least the vastness and view has them under the impression that the hotel is half decent. The only aspect this hotel has going for it is the location. Second to none for the price. I could not fault the location at all. But if you do want to stay in NY for more than one night I would not suggest here as you would need a shower and we could not even venture into our shower with the lack of hot water and cleanliness. Maybe in the summer the lack of heating and cold water would be a good thing? I wouldn't want to see if that is the case. As if being delayed by a day wasn't bad enough we got put in this [--]! I tried to refrain from using bad language but there's no other way to truly describe it.,TishHugsTrees
UR17136596,2008-22-June,This hotel is not worth the savings. Yes you can save some money here relative to some of the other hotels in the same neighborhood but you are risking wasting an enormous amount of time when you check in. We stayed in June of 2008 and arrived at 1pm in the afternoon. There are 1700 rooms and not nearly enough front desk clerks to accommodate that type of volume. After waiting on the queue for about fifteen minutes we were told that the room wasn't ready and to return after 3pm. Fair enough but it costs us $8 to store our bags in the lower storage area of the hotel and of course we had to tip the bellman who took us there (you can't access it on your own). We returned to check in around 4:15 pm and found a huge line of about 60 people trying to check in with three clerks at the front desk trying to accommodate. Having dinner reservations we could not wait on the line for an hour so we went downstairs to our stored luggage and changed in the bathroom! Later that night we returned at 11:30pm and still had to wait on a half hour line to check in. Our complaints fell on deaf ears and the room was less than mediocre and certainly not worth the wait and inconvenience. I do no t recommend this hotel unless you do not value your time.,drpete9
UR19249602,2008-22-August,One and a quarter hours just to be checked in. The first night's rooms were on the 5th floor and were awful! After compaining we were moved to the 10th floor at 11:30pm we supervised the cleaning of our own room!,paperclipflop
UR19217123,2008-21-August,I booked this hotel out of desperation. The rate was $280 for just one night. I waited in line to check in for about 20 minutes while I waited I visited the restrooms in the lower lobby of the hotel. This was the first sign of a really old poorly maintained hotel. The hotel has the common Art Deco-ish Manhattan design. When I got to the room I realized that this hotel must have been renovated many many decades ago. The bathroom tile was covered in mold the bathtub didn't drain. The carpet was filthy. Even the toilet paper was cheap come on it's toilet paper. Beds were OK. Don't expect a courteous staff I've received better hospitality at a Travelodge next to I-75 in Lake City Florida at 3am. Although the people at the luggage storage room ($4 per bag) were somewhat courteous. If the owner's of this hotel were willing to spend a few dollars renovating this hotel it has the potential to become a hotel destination in Manhattan. It has a great location: across the street from Madison Square Garden around the corner from Macy's blocks away from the Empire State Building and Fifth Avenue.,nelmedina
UR12831076,2008-20-January,Just recently I stayed at the Hotel Pennsylvania for a school function. Luckily we weren't crammed into the hotel all day as it was probably one of the worst I have ever stayed in. When I entered the hotel I was surprised at how elegant the lobby was. Checking in wasn't that bad as some people said and it only took about 10 minutes (and this included loading our bags into the cart to be taken to our rooms - which was a nice touch). Stepping onto our floor I was a little confused seeing the doors to the rooms as they looked very awkward with a disgusting 'cover' (?) over each that made each room look like a mini prison-cell. Yet walking in the prison-cell idea came to life. The room was far smaller than I imagined with two VERY small beds that oddly took up the bulk of the room. We were also greeted with missing necessities like a clock (we were forced to use phones/laptops/the TV for time) a refrigerator (which our neighbor had) and most importantly clean sheets. To top off such a warming entrance one of us decided to brush our teeth and was 'delighted' to see that the water had a yellow-tint for a few moments after being turned on. Although many describe the bathrooms as extremely old and disgusting it isn't as bad as you may think. Yes parts were old and moldy (like a corner with a rusted window) but the shower toilet and sink were somewhat clean and usable. Yet if I had the choice I would never stay at this hotel again unless some drastic changes were made. This hotel was so much potential as it has a perfect location (perfect for teenagers young adults who like NYC experience) but lacks some of the bare qualities one expects in such a so-called 'high end' hotel. To conclude the staff was friendly the room was very below average but at least the 24 hour cafe was good!,SchoolTraveler23
UR13705286,2008-20-February,I have landed in the UK today after 4 nights in the Hotel Pennsylvania. I was quite happy with the hotel at first although it was a bit dated and a bit like walking into 1964 - old damaged furniture brown carpets and a bathroom requiring a refurb - but I thought I could look past that especially as it was a really good location. However the more I saw of the hotel the more I could see how dirty it was. The carpet in the room had chewing gum or such like ground into it. The grouting in the bathroom required fixing the enamel on the bath was in great need of replacing. The corridors needed hoovering and the area by the vending machines was grotty. We stayed on the 2nd floor and I didn't see any other floor apart from the lobby (of course) and the lower lobby room where you are charged $4 to store your cases for an hour or so. The lobby itself was not brilliant either. You could just tell that it was an old hotel that had not been updated for years. I try to make a point of not reading reviews before I go somewhere as I probably wouldn't stay anywhere but I did with this hotel!! There were pictures on this site of cockroaches which I must say put me off but hey it was all booked!!! Third day into the stay my partner went to run a bath and ran back into the room as there was a roach in the bath. Now I am not a specialist in these things but don't cockroaches go where it is dirty? This is the reason I would not return to this hotel. I would pay a little bit extra and stay anywhere between 32nd street and 52nd street between 5th and 8th Avenue as this would still be central to Time Square the Chrysler and Empire State Buildings. The Crowne Plaza looks lovely - but I don't know about the price!?,Marky1978
UR19180449,2008-20-August,My Wife and I stayed at Hotel Penn on August 16 2008 and vowed never to stay there again. We checked in at 2P but we were late for a seminar and so didn't check the room out before we left. We came back that night and realized that the bathroom had old fittings and stuff. We were too tired to go down and complain plus we were leaving in a few hours. When we woke up in the morning we really saw the mess. Dusty table dirty and stained windows broken walls broken tiles and decaying walls in the bathroom messy bath-tub. We refused to take a shower and checked out as fast as we can. At the front desk we complained to the personnel and they just shrugged. One actually laughed when I mentioned that that will be the last time we stay there. It has a great location in the middle of NYC and all but avoid it if at all costs.,FirstPrince
UR16613817,2008-2-June,Anyone contemplating this hotel - please spend a few extra dollars and go anywhere but here! Strong rumour that it is soon to be demolished and I can see why - it is horrible once you get past the elevators! I even tried all the tricks suggested by many fellow travellers to get upgraded (being nice to the checkin clerk asking for a nice room the birthday - it really was my birthday!) and if that worked I would hate to see what I would have got if I hadn't asked! The room was so dark and dirty that I was sorry I had decided to stay an extra night. When I complained at reception all I was told was that they were full and couldn't help! As i had prepaid through 1800-hotels I could not leave. Pleas take my advice and do not stay here.................ever!!!!,chelseagirl2
UR22373924,2008-2-December,As a travel agent I have traveled alot and have stayed in many hotels. This is about the worst you can get. I had read the reviews thinking it can't be that bad. IT IS.,leneanne
UR20197603,2008-19-September,My daughter and I chose the hotel for the location. That was the only good thing about it. Our room a twin on the second floor had filthy stinking carpets a TV that didn't work bathroom shelf that was sloping so much nothing could be put on it a filthy cracked bath and was barely big enough to swing a cat in! A cat would have been ideal though as when I woke up at 3 a.m i was greeted by a cockroach on the bedside table 2 on the wall one in my slippers and one in my bed..................................! I complained rather loudly in the lobby to the night manager who I told I had photographic evidence. It pays to complain as he moved us straight away to a huge room on the 4th floor. No more wildlife was found.....!,MaryHen
UR20995731,2008-19-October,The location was the only good thing about this hotel. I found it to be way overpriced and understaffed. My room had a terrible musty damp smell the roof was covered in mould. I could hear every single sound coming from the surrounding rooms. The room didn't even have basic facilities only an iron no fridge or even a coffee maker. So what you are paying for then I have no idea! It took over an hour and a half to check in and the staff at the front desk were so miserable. I would never ever stay there again and would highly advise other travellers to think twice before they do to.,nikki073
UR14396307,2008-19-March,Firstly the negatives:- The decorating was seriously in need of updating Plaster falling off the walls No plug in bathroom sink Bathroom door swollen too big to close The positives:- We had a fantastic view of the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building from our window Clean sheets and towels every day Lots of hot water from a great power shower. Superkingsize bed No bugs micecockoaches or other un-invited room guests (as noted by some other reviewers) We'd read some really awful reviews before going and almost changed hotels. Glad we didn't - it was basic but location makes up for it. We asked the receptionist - Sheila - for a room with a view and she was only too happy to oblige. Close to lots of the sights and we would also recommend Andrews for great breakfasts (turn right out of Hotel a couple of blocks up on the same side as Hotel) Don't go expecting too much from Hotel Pennsylvania and you won't be disappointed.,js11
UR20182105,2008-18-September,the room was filthy dead bugs on the floor lighting not working air con was rusted to death and ratteled loudly when it was turned on carpet in room was stained all over cigerate burns on bed clothes the bathroom was also filthy we would of been better off on a bench in central park we asked to be moved room and they moved us to an exactly the same room just no bugs visable any way thank god we only stayed their for three nights .it was our first time in NYC and it ruinned our first 3 days . and it wasnt all that cheap either stayed in another hotel for the remainder of the week paid the same money and it was a real palace park central hotel . Just really happy that we stayed in the shabby dump first . i would not even class this hotel as a one star and will never ever recommend it to any one i was appalled at the standard dont let the internet pictures of rooms fool you they are nothing like the reality that you will be sleeping in.if they spent more money in the rooms instead of the main lobby they would benifit more ........,fionacoakley
UR15120420,2008-18-April,Despite having read the previous reviews and mentally preparing my wife that this dream trip to New York may not meet all her expectations she still burst into tears when we entered the room. Lobby is spacious which is fortunate beacuse it was full of dogs for the duration of our stay (Dogs show across the Street at Madison Square Gardens). Check-In was painfully slow. A guest interrupted my checking in to advise the staff member that he was not prepared to stay in the room he had been allocated; staff member changed his booking but then tried to book me into the room that the other guy had refused! The room we did get was not much better. Reasonable size but it was "grubby". Child's crayon all over the walls damp patches scuff marks filthy carpet and bathroom was not much better. Thankfully the bedding was spotlessly clean or else we would have checked in elsewhere. Location is great but there are other similarly priced hotels in the same locale. We spent so little time in the hotel room that the holiday was not ruined but the reviews are accurate and honest -I'm only sorry I didn't check this site before booking with local agent. A lesson learned!,FamilyPross
UR14349298,2008-17-March,The first room they put us in was filthy--with black mold all over the tile around the tub. THEN they put us in another room and during the night I got HUNDREDS of bug bites from bedbugs. They have a whole routine in place for bugs--the exterminator told me he's at the hotel all the time because there's bedbugs everywhere--especially on the 14th floor. They can't get rid of them because they get into the wiring. I've had to throw away my suitcase and double wash my clothes in hot water and disinfectant and spray them down with alcohol and I'm terrified I've brought bugs home. Stay at this pit at your own peril.,wandacleo
UR20122337,2008-16-September,The hotel is in a brilliant location. On arrival it appears pretty decent. The rooms are more like those i have experienced in hostels rather than that of a hotel. That said we paid 90/$160 for 4 nights - i think they miscalculated but I would have begrudged paying anymore. If you like no frills and just need a bed then stay here. Although it may have just been me but the sheets on the bed caused extreme amounts on static and i continually got static shocks from things so bring your own sheet! I would not recommend against staying here but there are better quality hostels in New York for the same cost if not less in just as good an area of the city. It is a place i would recommend to friends but not my parents.,Lydia-o
UR20938915,2008-16-October,The only thing that this hotel has going for it is its location. My wife and I stayed there at the beginning of October prior to joining a cruise ship. The staff at reception were sullen and not at all friendly our room was a poky little place with filthy windows and it seemed as though it had not had a proper clean for some time. There were plastic ties lying on the floor when we arrived and they were still there when we left and the dust at the carpet edges and skirting boards was unbelieveable. Being Brit's with the stiff upper lip we thought at least the bed is clean so we'll put up with it for the two nights we had booked. We paid $686.00 for a two night stay which to me after the experience is an absolute rip-off. The hotel is run down in need of total re-furbishment as do the staff and management. Some might say why did you not point out your misgivings but my opinion is that I should not have them to start with.,norwegiandawn
UR12702150,2008-16-January,I stayed here twice in the past 18 months. i should have known better after the 1st trip so its my own fault for going back the 2nd time. location and price swayed it both times but never again!!!!! it is filthy dark and depressing.the queues are a mile long checking in. the rooms are dirty and i suspect that any prison cell would be more cheerful to stay in. after a long flight it is nice to relax in a nice hotel room and also after a hard days shopping. it is depressing to return to the room in the evening. the bed is very poor quality. the bathroom is antiquated. mouldy tiles. please dont stay here. for a few dollars more try somewhere else. however it is only 2 blocks from macys and across the road from madison square garden,sheba55
UR15085245,2008-16-April,Spent 5 days in the hotel. While the location and staff were excellent this old hotel needs a great deal of work. The room was old and looked it. It needed a new paint job. To call the lighting poor is an understatement. It was almost non-existent. The carpeting was stained. The heating didn't work and when we called for service we were told no heating is supplied if the temperature outside is greater than 52%. The hotel was crowded and obviously bringing in money. They just do not have a desire to spend it.,Frank3473
UR20101379,2008-15-September,The room was pretty dire - very shabby furnishings several large damp patches on the walls that were a bit mouldy and the paint was flaking off. On the second night I noticed 2 cockroaches in the bathroom and plugged the gap between the door and floor with a towel. On the final morning before 6am we were awoken by incessant banging (they were refurbishing rooms on the floor below) despite several complaints to reception the banging continued. All in all I would stay here again but only because I would hope to be in a refurbed roomits central and is cheap for what you get relative to other hotels.,Poppy28
UR21875561,2008-15-November,Ladies and Gentlemen what ever you do do not ever stay at this place!!!!

UR16067522,2008-15-May,Myself and my girlfriend stayed at the Hotel Pennsylvania in July 2007 for seven nights on our first visit to New York. It must be remembered that with this hotel you get what you pay for. It is one of the cheapest hotels in New York which is an expensive city. Similarly hotel rooms in the city are generally small by international standards no matter what class of hotel you stay in. If you are on a budget- as we were- you can't beat the Pennsylvania for location. Having said that the hotel itself is of a very poor standard. I believe the Pennsylvania was built in the 1920s and I would be very suprised if it has been re-decorated since. The main (perhaps only) thing this place has going for it is its location. It is in the heart of Manhattan right beside Madison Square Garden and Penn Station (which is connected to three subway lines- excellent for sight-seeing) five minutes from Macys and ten from Times Square. So for the tourist going to the Big Apple for the first time the Pennsylvania's central location is a huge plus. As for the hotel itself the standard is pretty low. I would go so far as to say it is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. Firstly when we arrived we spent 45 minutes in the line to check in. When we got to the top of the line the lady who was supposed to check us in had just realised she made a mistake with the previous customer. She left us standing for approximately 30 minutes while she attempted to rectify her mistake. When she finally got back to us she insisted we pay for the entire stay up front. Finally an hour and a half after we arrived at the hotel we were given our key and went to our room. The room itself was small but as it was New York- and clearly a budget hotel- I expected that. The walls were in bad need of re-painting and the toilet facilities were also very basic. When we returned later that day I recieved a phone call from reception. It was the lady who checked us in. According to her she had mis-counted the money we gave her at check in and we had left her fifty dollars short. This only added to my feeling of frustration with the check in process. Throughout my stay I found the hotel staff quite disinterested in their work. Also with so many people in the line to check in (no matter what time of the day or night) the lobby of the hotel was more reminiscent of a train station that a place of residence. So in summary if you book the Pennsylvania you will know it is one of the cheapest places around. Therefore it is unreasonable to expect a top-drawer facility and this hotel certainly does not fall into that category. In conclusion given the (relatively) cheap rates and fantastic location it is probably worth putting up with the Pennsylvania's faults. Just.,philip861
UR16946437,2008-15-June,This hotel is huge with thousands of rooms.Upon arrival you enter a large busy lobby and an equally large queue.(The lobby is never not busy and has the atmostphere of a train station).When we arrived not only was the hotel full but it was overbooked.Some staff behind the desk are freindly and helpful but others lack even basic training and are nothing but rude... so be prepared!!!Check in can turn out to be a challenging experience.The staff have heard all the complaints before and are used to them.Three managers and 24hours later our group managed to aquire three rooms that were acceptable.It is essential that a superior room is booked as the standard rooms are very basic  dark  small and tatty.The corridors in the hotel are large featureless and very dark.Not helped by the dark carpets. The bedroom doors are 'interesting' and you would you think someone painted them blindfolded. Even the superior rooms are in need of renovation as the decor is old and tired.The lights in the rooms are no better than candle power and we had to remove the lamp shades so we could see.The bathrooms have not changed since the day the hotel was built .On the postive side the hotel is in a great location as everything is nearby.The beds ( to my suprise) were comfortable.No sign of the bedbugs... I did check before accepting the room!!!! Clean sheets/towels arrived every day and the room was serviced to a reasonable standard.The coffee in the small deli downstairs was excellent.According to one of the managers the hotel was purchased for the value of the land and therefore as little money will be spent on it as possible.This is certainly very obvious and is such a shame.I wouldn't stay here again even it was free but New York was so great!!!!!!!!!,ManchesterChris
UR12625545,2008-15-January,Essentially there isn't much to say about this hotel other than to believe all of the previous bad reviews. I was unfortunate enough to stay herel on my recent trip to NYC. Personally I don't expect much I just like to stay in a basically clean maintained hotel - and this one does not fit that bill. One thing to note is that I think *some* of the rooms may have been renovated - which is why there are a couple of positive reviews but the chances of getting a nice room are very slim. The sole positive aspect of this hotel is the location right across from Madison Square Gardens and walking distance to Times Square Macys & many shops theatres attractions and transportation. The hotel website pictures are very deceiving since the lobby is the best looking part of the whole hotel and it goes way downhill from there. The few staff we encountered were generally pleasant and helpful its too bad they have to work in such a rundown place. Take a look at the candid traveller photos - they accurately represent what you're getting! To begin with the whole hotel is absolutely filthy - I couldn't find a single clean area during my visit. Everything from bangs dents stains and marks on walls to peeling paint rusty fixtures and broken furniture. Our room came complete with an electrical socket that hung out of the wall a window that wouldn't close a bathroom knob that actually came off in our hands and an unmentionable bathroom. The bed came supplied with a broken mattress worn sheets and stained coverlet. I never took my shoes off in the room didn't sleep well & did not feel clean there. Its tough to relax and have a nice hot shower after a long day of sightseeing with paint peeling around you and above your head. This may be *budget* New York but personally I'd have paid a LOT more to not have to stay there. I would think that if you've planned a long awaited vacation and are spending a few days in the city you'll feel much more relaxed and comfortable in another hotel. Although I've never stayed there my best friend who stayed with me recommended the "Edison" similar in price range but much nicer and cleaner overall. To that end I saw several hotels around the area - so it would pay to do your homework here. Parents don't bring little ones - I wouldn't want any of my kids on the filthy floor or touching any of the bare wires or broken things I saw all over this hotel. I wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone much less a friend or family member. You'll only be happy here if you don't care at all about the cleanliness of the room you're staying in just need a place to crash for a night or two and spend as little time as possible in the dank and dingy cells they call rooms. My two cents cabs are cheap in NYC - if you can't find a hotel to fit your budget within walking distance of Times Square consider staying out of the district in a nicer hotel and use the money towards cab fare or transportation costs. I wish I'd had that option.,Sinoed
UR18978490,2008-15-August,I have stayed at this hotel twice now once in April 2006 and again in May 2007. The first time around was fine. The room was great very clean no problems. The second year was a terrible. I requested a non-smoking/non-mold/non-fragrence room. The first one had a smoker the 2nd one they went around and sprayed fragrence to cover the smoke smell the 3rd one had mold all over the bathroom. Since I was in a group i didn't make them move again and the hotel kept telling me they didn't have any other rooms but i was miserable the whole trip from the amount of allergy medicine i had to take and the lack of showering since a few minutes in the bathroom would cause my throat to swell shut. I paid cash for the baggage check as agreed when booking the trip and they still charged the credit card for it even though i was told i HAD to pay cash to check the bags when i went to check the bags so we were charged double for that. The staff was rude and thought i was the one being stupid for wanting to change out of a room i couldn't breathe in. My original clean room was given away to someone who was paying a little more. on my check in sheet my original room was the one i stayed in on my first trip and then they crossed it off and put me in the crap rooms. The location is amazing but it really is a hit or miss hotel. It may be great it may be awful. Book with caution.,chrystie83
UR15001598,2008-13-April,I travelled here with a group of 30. When we arrived the lobby looked like it belonged to a high star hotel however the second we stepped out of the elevator our view of the hotel changed compleatly. The carpet was a disgusting brown and the wall were the most discusting shade of green I've ever seen. The rooms varied in size greatly and unlike the website had said had deffinatly not been refurbished recently. The bathroom was tiny and the water took about 5 minutes to drain after having taken a shower. Everyone felt a bit uneasy about going to sleep in the hotel that night and when the 7 of us in one room woke up the next morning we were willing to make the most of the hotel and enjoy our stay untill five minutes later we see a cockroach crawling about our room. it scurried away and then two minutes later we got two more cockroaches running around. running under beds and next to our suitcases. the next morning we only had one cockroach scurrying around our room. The only plus about this hotel is its situation it is opposite maddison square gardens and only a few blocks away from 5th avenue where all the good shops are central park and times square it is also only a two mnute walk away from macys! I honeslty would not reccomend this hotel to anyone. I'm positive there are nicer hotels for less that what we were charged nearby.,Lizz_W
UR20017424,2008-12-September,I made the mistake of visiting NY on Memorial Day weekend--yikes! From the check in at the hotel to the Empire State Building the lines were ridiculous! You would've thought we didn't have a reservation it took an 1 1/2 hours to check in. Don't expect much more than a bed and a bathroom the rooms are the smallest I've ever seen. Its a really old hotel and needs a lot of work but it was only 2 nights and we were only in the room about 6 hours each night due to sight-seeing. The hallways were dimly lit I didn't really feel safe. I think the guy in working in the luggage room was pocketing the luggage fees he didn't even give us a receipt. The location was great but I would not stay here again I would rather pay more.,DuckyAugusta_GA
UR14243325,2008-12-March,We've stayed at the Hotel Penn for several years while attending the Westminster Dog Show. This year will be our last as the thrill of being in the middle of all of the action has worn off and no longer compensates for the dirty run down rooms...even the "premium" rooms have issues... My dog found two old rat traps behind the heater which still had poison on them but had obviously been placed and somehow "sprung long ago. She also found a pen cap and some other small items under the bed...a bead and something else can't remember. The final straw this year was the valet parking causing $2000.00 worth of damage to my vehicle without acknoweledging it was their fault or trying to compensate us at all. My friends $800.00 Zoom Lens was also "lost" in Luggage Storage while she waited for her room. We will probably try the Affinia next year but we are definitly DONE with the Hotel Penn. Oh and those dirty yellow and green striped comfortors look like something they bought and last washed in the 1970's!,NewHampshireHoneyPot
UR16879224,2008-12-June,Me my mother and my grandmother stayed here for 3 nights. We weren't attacked at night didn't see any rodents and found the fixtures in the room bearable. That being said I can only describe this hotel as depressing. The room gave a very unpleasant vibe had poor lighting and was just not a nice place to come back to after a busy day. If you are considering staying here you are probably reading through the 1500 reviews for this hotel and seeing some raving praises next to horror stories. It would be stupid of me to say something similar to what I see in many reviews such as "don't believe the bad reviews!" or "It is the worst hotel in the world". Clearly a hotel of this size (1700 rooms) simply has good OK and horrible rooms and I believe that some people have had a wonderful experience there. If you look at the average rating though you will see that clearly many were not happy...question is are you are willing to take the risk? Personally I would rather pay 50$ more and not risk another similar or worse experience to what I have had in this establishment.,tgolin
UR16839532,2008-11-June,Unfortunately this was a business trip where the client booked this hotel for us and we had no choice of leaving. There were inches on dust and grime on the large fake "chandeliers" and plastic flowers centered in the lobby area grime all over the floor dirt smears and broken glass in the lobby mirrors homeless people somewhat loitering in the indoor payphone area (hidden from the front desk by a partition but still part of the hotel lobby. near a long scary looking hallway with another door to the street. front desk made me use a payphone instead of agreeing to call my husband on the front desk phone to make sure I was a legitimate guest as we arrived on separate flights). The elevator was extremely dirty and rickety; hallways were dark darkly carpeted dirty. Room and bathroom you can imagine. They were no better. Stuffy stale itchy/stained bedding rust and dirt stained ceiling tiles and bathroom appliances and fixtures etc etc. "Window" of an airshaft looking at a brick wall less than 12 inches away and a lot of pigeons pigeon excrement feathers and debris built up in between. Plus I believe they wanted an extra $15 per day to access the in-room internet. A very bad stay unfriendly staff unsettling atmosphere. We used to live in New York City for many years and this is definitely not the way to experience the city. Nor is it ay cheaper than much better cleaner hotels. As to the payphone experience I also have to say the phones were disgustingly filmy slimy and grimy. My cell phone was dead and I was exhausted after a long flight alone from the west coast. I had to pay for the phone call to my husband's room upstairs on my credit card as I had no change on me just bills. Which the front desk also would not change for me after refusing to call the room. I have never been treated so rudely at a hotel before and never been denied having them call up to a room to ask a guest if I can enter. That was just the icing on the cake compared to the state of the hotel itself.,KristinCarlson
UR18850088,2008-11-August,This hotel is a dump. Talk about a bait and switch. The rooms look nothing like the pictures on their website. Our first room was filthy and smelled god awful. We complained and were given another room on the 5 th floor. This room was better but still left a whole lot to be desired. The entire floor smelled like feces. The hallways are dark dingy and have plaster falling off the walls. Our friends stayed on the 10 th floor and experienced the same. Also they fail to tell you that if you book with a debit card they charge an extra $75 a day for any damage. They claim they will refund it but that remains to be seen. Do yourself a favor and find somewhere else to stay.,fpd818
UR19949269,2008-10-September,The location of this hotel was excellent easy walking to a lot of sights and right across from Penn Station to go anywhere else. The room wasnt particularly clean a couple of things on the carpet nexver moved in the 4 nights we were there the shower dripped the whole time we were there I mentionned it twice but it wasnt fixed the noise kept us awake at night as did the exceptional noise from the street(we were on 10th floor)it needs double glazing. There was hardly storage space for our belongings and the room was very small for 2 people.The worst thing was when they charged us 4 dollars per case to leave our luggage for 2 hours beware!,harrassedmum
UR12497085,2008-10-January,This hotel is definitely the worst I have ever stayed in. Besides the fact that the place is dirty dingy and looks like more like a prison than a hotel the staff are downright rude and and even dishonest. I left some clothes behind me in my room when I checked out (accidently I should say) and when I returned from my friends house to retrieve them the staff lied to me saying that the guest who stayed there after me must have taken them even though this was the very next day!! I never write reviews online but I was so upset after this awful "holiday" that I feel I have to warn other people about this place. It has put me off New York for good.,KateDublin_8
UR22614119,2008-10-December,I have never stayed in a youth hostle but am sure that they must be on a similar vain to this hotel. I left the booking of the said hotel to friends ! who were advised positively by a travel agent. I knew on arrival that trouble lay ahead. I have only ever stayed in 4 stars and above but my companions were on a budget and I thought that a 2star establishment could not be that bad I was wrong !!. The staff were friendly on reception and were the hotels only redeeming feature. The queue was reminisent to that of an overused airport and check in was slow due to an undermaned desk. The common areas of the hotel were shaby and dingy and the rooms reflected what I would imagine to be a cheap brothel ( I only said imagine !! ) Dark carpets flakeing paint holes patched with a sheet of plaster board  and the bathrooms do not look like they have had an upgrade since the 1930s. The heating dates back to the arc and the non existent double glazing meant that you could hear the sound of the city ( and it is noisy ) 24 hours a day.I considered throwing myself from our room on the 16th floor but decided that New York had alot more to offer ( it did ) . The window safety cables incidently were all broken so it was possible to open them fully. Those wishing to take youngsters becareful. My advise. Stay well away and do not believe any positive reviews . The owners should be ashamed .,Edward999
UR19624693,2008-1-September,My son and I came to NYC to see the Yanks and wanted a place near Penn Station for 1 night We had stayed at the Affinia just two blocks away earlier in the Spring and wanted to go back there but they were sold out so we booked Hotel Pennsylvania. I will never go back. In the 1st room we were given the bathroom light kept flickering. They said they could fix it. I said we wanted another room. They switched us to a smaller room but at least the bathroom light worked. When my son pulled down the covers he found a piece of plastic and a hair on the sheets. At that late hour we didn't want to switch again (and what would we get) so we made the best of it. It was just one night. But in the room there was: no Bible no pad of paper no pen no washcloths and no way we'll ever be there again. The only positive was that the 19th floor gym was okay - carpet reminded me of what my grandmother had 40 years ago but a good selection of equipment. The final kicker - they charged to hold my bags for the day. The Affinia had done it for free. That will be my first choice next time.,TimetoRead
UR20524403,2008-1-October,My sister and I stayed here while in NY on a shopping trip. It was booked before we read the reviews obviously ! We were both very nervous having read the reviews and were expecting the worst but believe it or not there was worse to come. After 30 minutes waiting to check in with the receptionist who thought we were from Iran or Iraq instead of Ireland although we're both blonde ! She thought it was great that our husbands let us go away on our own ! After check in we went up in the lift to our room and Oh My God ! It was absolutely disgusting. First of all I got two electric shocks from the light switch in the bathroom !!!! The room was filthy dirty. The walls were crumbling the carpet was filthy and the first thing we did was check the beds for animals I called reception and told the receptionist about the electric shocks and that we wanted to be moved immediately. She sent up a lovely lady who goes around the hotel writing out incident reports (enough said). She took down the details of the electric shock and said she would have a porter come up to move us to a new room. After another 30 minutes a knock came to the door. I opened the door and a male porter arrived in and his words which I quote " So whats the problem ladies bedbugs cockroaches or mice" !!!!!!!!! My sister went into shock I think. I asked him if bedbugs etc were common in the hotel and he said they don't have a problem with mice rats as they have exterminators in every month. However the bedbugs can be a problem !! He brought us to a new room which to be honest wasn't much better a little cleaner maybe. This room was tiny but we had paid for the hotel and they were not willing to give refunds. The porter checked the beds for bedbugs without us asking him to do it. Apparently when you book into this hotel you are obliged not to complain. This disclaimer was signed at the travel agent where the trip was booked but I was not aware of this at the time. We stayed at the hotel for four nights and I have to say it completely ruined our break. This hotel is like a dungeon and I cannot stress enough how dirty disgusting and smelly it is. My advice would be to never ever ever stay here. The Affinia next door is a lovely hotel and not much more expensive. I have attached photographs in the event anyone thinks I'm overreacting. I've travelled quite a lot in Asia the US and Europe over the past ten years and I can honestly say that this is without a shadow of a doubt the worst hotel I have ever had to misfortune to stay in. BTW this is the first hotel review I have ever submitted. BE WARNED !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,eabhagrace
UR15554788,2008-1-May,I stayed in the hotel the night of April 28th because I was attending a conference at the hotel on the 29th. It was a mistake. The staff was very very nice but there were just too many problems. I stayed in room 1224A. First my room key would not work. Security had to let me into my room. The staff tried twice to get the computer to make a key that worked but to no avail. It finally got so late that I told them to forget it; I wasn't going out and I would just stay in my room until check out. The next problem was that the 7 AM wake up call I requested did not materialize. Since I woke up on time anyway it didn't matter but obviously it could have been a problem. Finally there was no shower head just a piece of pipe sticking out of the wall. It looked like there used to be a shower head at some point. It made it hard to get a shower. This was no huge problem but together with the lack of a functional key and the lack of a wake up call it added up to a less than optimal experience. I saw no other business travelers in the hotel. I imagine the hotel is in European guidebooks as an inexpensive place to stay in NYC which it was. I saw plenty of young Europeans. I saw no other Americans as guests. Of course this is not a problem at all; as a matter of fact it was fun to be around the guests from other countries. It just was not what I was looking for as a business traveler. Still it was clean enough. The staff was not very good at doing their jobs but they were definitely very nice.,CarolAnnBrynMawr
UR18503879,2008-1-August,After arriving form Dublin and enduring a long delay at airport to see a long queue at reception desk in hotel was almost the last straw. No that was left to the unsmiling desk staff  has anyone ever heard of customer service in this hotel . No fridge in room and when I requested one I was told that would be fine provided I paid 20 dollars  another near arguement and they relented I got my fridge which was really great as the air conditionong was like behaving like an orchestra. Do not buy a ticket from the tourist desk within this hotel  we were charged 145 dollars for a 72 dollar seat for Mama Mia show on Broadway. The cleaning staff are lovely and do a good job on the rooms.,GeorgioDublin
UR10061297,2007-9-October,I've stayed at the Pennsylvania a few times out of desperation. The rooms were filthy and the decor theme of the bathroom seemed to be "Mold-Mid Century". The beds leaved much to be desired. The only plus I could take out of this (other than not having to have a tetanus booster) was that the front desk was efficient and slightly friendly (I checked in very late probably avoiding the rush) and the location is convenient to all mass transportation. I've learned my lesson though and now go a few blocks up to the Hilton Gerden on 8th. Worth the walk!,MetroNYCTraveler
UR10713284,2007-9-November,....this hotel is the singularly most disgusting place I have stayed in. I have only lived in stayed in one place worse and that was a bad hostel. My friend warned me that someone private messaged her to say we shouldn't stay at this hotel we had fallen for the hotel's bright and shiny website and the fact they claimed they had renovated rooms. A lot of the pictures show on this website depict the experience. but what they don't show is the stench. When we arrived we were given a room that had blood and hair in one bed (I kid you not). There was thick dust everywhere (everything was gray because of it) We were shattered but we were forced to go down to reception. We were then given another room this room was better but had not been cleaned. I thought they had given us someone else's room by mistake. because there was rubbish everywhere beds looked like they had just been slept in. So back down we went. Finally they gave us a room which was better but still has my room crawling. I remember the stench and the terrible old bathroom. On my last day there I met a guy from another state who recounted almost exactly the same story to us but he was smarter and had demanded his money back for the bad service. I would not recommend this place to anyone...I have stayed in hostels and hotels alike of varying levels and this is truly awful.,Summersunt
UR7573043,2007-9-May,It's a crack hotel. Everything is filthy. Urine smell in the halls dirty windows dark creepy hallways strange forgotten connecting rooms broken doors missing doorknobs peeling paint broken tiles filthy bedspreads filthy rugs filthy blankets no service stained mattresses dead bugs had to switch rooms three times and still uninhabitable brought me to tears. I only stayed here for one night on business because everything else was sold out and was fooled by the nice looking lobby.,VirginiaTraveler5
UR6966453,2007-9-March,If you've heard the stories and figured they were exaggerations don't fool yourself. Do not stay at this hotel if you desire anything in terms of quality and service. We have been going to NYC for the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show for quite a while now. The Penn is the host hotel for this show and it is convenient but up until this year we had never stayed there because of all the stories that we had heard. Unfortunatly due to extenuating circumstances we had to make our reservation at the Penn because we made our reservations late and the hotel that we usually booked was full. We figured "it can't be that bad" and "it's so close to the Garden." I don't care if they move the center court line at MSG to the lobby of the Penn we will not be staying there again. When we arrived we had to wait FOREVER for a bellman to assist us with our bags and they won't LET you do it yourself -- some kind of union thing. We got into our room and while it wasn't as bad as we had anticipated we were less than impressed. It was a TINY room. An exciting part was the VERY LARGE bathtub just perfect for a bubble bath - except when you collect the water in the tub it was a brownish green color - EWW. So all was going well until we came back from siteseeing our second day there - unable to get back into our room. Our key would not work. We went to the front desk for duplicate keys - they didn't work either. We waited in the hallway outside our room - mind you our show dogs were still locked inside our room - for 3 hours for someone to fix our door. After we finally were able to enter our door they told us that we would have to move rooms because they didn't know for sure what was wrong with our door and couldn't know for sure if it would happen again. So we loaded all of our stuff up on carts - we were there FOR the dog show and we had A LOT of stuff. And headed to the next room. This one was even tinier AND the wall outside the bathroom was literally disintegrating meanwhile dropping debris on the carpet. When we told the bellman that this room was unacceptable he said that his shift was over and he had to go home so he left our things in the hallway and we waited for a different room and a new bellman. Two more substantard rooms were offered before we arrived at one that would work. It was actually a room upgrade for us and was quite spacious. Not good enough to make me ever want to go back. The next few days went by without anything remarkable to note. Then came time to check out. A storm was coming and we wanted to leave in time to make it home (ohio) before we would be affected. So we got up early the day of check out and called down to the front desk to call for our car. They said when the car arrived we should call for a bellman. We waited almost an hour for the car and when we called for the bellman he said there would be an hour wait. It eneded up that we did get stuck in the snow and hour away from home and if they hadn't made us wait twice - we likely would have made it home safely the same day. The bad things you hear about this hotel are true. I've heard other stories but never any of them any good. Don't waste your money. If this is the area of town you want to stay in shorten your trip by a day if money is an issue and stay in the Affinia Manhattan where they do care about how they treat you and what you think of their accomodations. I will never stay in the Penn again.,ChosenOne413
UR7817922,2007-9-June,I have to preface this by saying that for the money you simply cannot beat the location. We walked to Times Square the Empire State buiding Central Park (though that was a bit of a hike) and pretty much everywhere else during our stay. There was food shopping and all kinds of entertainment right outside our door and Penn Station was right across the street making for the utmost of convience. That being said we booked two rooms for four nights. The king room had some strange sort of mold growing all over the shower that was completely disgusting. While they did offer to move us to another room the next room had similar growth in the bathroom. The gem of this room however was the view of the ESB! We decided to stay. The other room had two twin beds. There was obvious fading on the walls where the headboards had once been. The room showed signs of age and wear; little things that could have been kept up with but were not. The view from this room was straight into another room. Even straining as far as possible no glimpse of Manhattan could be seen. All in all though we were hardly ever in the room other than to sleep and the beds worked just fine for what we needed.,CarolinaGirl07
UR8075923,2007-8-July,We arrived late from Toronto having had flight problems and hold ups. Despite our room being booked months in advance they obviously don't allocate rooms to individuals so we were really surprise d to be given a room with dirty carpet dirty bathroom broken TV half the light bulbs were missing broken air conditioning etc. This was our most expensive hotel in a trip around north america - we would NEVER go back to New York again as this experience ruined our holiday. We asked to move rooms (in fact my wife and I were celebrating our 2nd wedding anniversary my wife was in tears) and they moved us to a room with a single bed - but at least the TV worked. We asked to move back to our original room as we really needed a double bed. Crashing into bed to sleep we were surprised that the fitted sheet didn't fit - our feet were on the matress. This hotel is HUGE and is hugely underinvested. They hadn't updated the decor in any of the 3 rooms we stayed in (they moved us on our second day to a barely 20th century room - I've stayed in better hotels in the 3rd world!) for 30+ years. They probably hadn't cleaned the rooms for a decade either. In short: do not stay at this hotel until they spend just a small amount of money on it. A complete and utter rip off.,harmsy
UR6564244,2007-8-January,We expected to find one cleanliness not exceptional but the rat in the room just not it was gone around calm between the suitcases and this is one seccante what truly. Naturally they have changed to us endured room and we have understood that all the plans are not equal some are more decent in how much restructures to you more than recent. Little sagacities type would be enough not to find the bath or the room with the rests of the previous hosts. However the hotel is in the central position a lot very connected with all.,mazzolini
UR11326781,2007-8-December,Room doors that look like coffin lids. Sea foam hotel sheets and towels bought from a prison supply store. Bedspread that maybe 10 years old. Somehow there was a flat screen TV in there but it randomly turned itself on and the weirdest hours. Anything over $100 a night is not worth it.,spanlaketraveler
UR8372450,2007-8-August,We recently had the misfortune of staying at this hotel. We queued for almost an hour to check in. When we finally got our room it was dirty wall paper was peeling off the walls; it smelled strongly of smoke despite it being a non-smoking room; and the cold water tap didn't work - the only redeeming features of the hotel were the location and the price....,EdinburghEuan
UR10631265,2007-6-November,Omg I'm suprised Health Inspectors dont shut this hotel down. our hotel had soo much mold under the heater there was a towel covering it up. Me and My girlfriend paid for a King Room... we got a twin bed..we complained ...we got our King But still... the room was nasty. we paid 400$ a night for 4 nights... we both got sick while sleeping in the room. And if ur hoping for a nyc view.... well u get a back alley view. the T.v is from the 70's the cable sucks hardly any reception. I do not recommend this Hotel to anyone. Only good thing about this hotel is its like 5 blocks away from Times Square and 50 feet from MSG. Never again I agree burn to the ground,JonFromPeg
UR6558978,2007-6-January,Well just got back from a 2 week stay at the penn hotel. Mixed feelings on the stay. Overall it was not a great experience. The room was a ok size with 2 double beds with torn bedsheets and linen. Bathroom was a bit small and quite dirty as well. Location is also ok but nothing great. (it depends on what you want to do ) In terms of the hotel i would say that if price is a issue its not tooo bad a place to stay however if you can find something along the same price probably take that option. Couple of reasons for the above comment  the caprpet in the room is filthy and is not vaccummed everyday (it was probably done once in the two weeks we stayed there ). In addition housekeeping has no idea what dusting means. Their idea of housekeeping is making the bed and replacing the towels and literally thats it dont expect anything more on a few days they did nto even bother to empty the rubbish bin in the room. While there i also kept my bags permanently locked and kept all valuables in my locked bags just go this feeling of uneasyness around the place. They do have safety deposit boxes but after you wait for half an hour to try and get a box and no one answer you really wonder if you want to leave valuables in a place like that. The other thing that is quite bad about the hotel is that you have to checkout by 12:00 pm (fair enough) but they charge you $4 storage fee for each bag that you want to leave in their luggage room after you have checked out. (most other hotesl will keep your bags for free) In terms of the staff they are about as usefull as a chocolate teapot. We had people in the room next door smoking on a non smoking floor and the smell kept coming in to our room When i complained I was told there is nothign we can do maybe housekeeping can spray somehting. (No staff member at that hotel seems to care about anything ) So overall if you are looking for a very basic roof over your head and basically a place to slepp this place if ok. If you plan on spending time relaxing in the room please book somehwere else even the bed sheets feel dirty. In conclusion this hotel is one that needs to be shut down all the staff ssacked and remaned in to a upper class hostel. Because that is what it is.,oac966
UR6748443,2007-5-February,This place is TERRIBLE the worst I have ever seen. Staff are rude and clueless. the first room they put me in was the wrong bed size it was filthly. The second room was even worse. Window would not close food on floor paint falling off the walls carpet looked nasty and door took some time and creativity to get locked. Never would I wish this place on anyone. The web site lies too and if you decide to risk it do not pre-pay by credit card or you will be sorry.,mkenmass2000
UR8619134,2007-4-September,I cried when i got to our room. We complained and were given an upgrade but it really put a damper on our trip. The room was dirty dingy smelled of damp and the bathroom-eughh!! I was impressed by the photos of the grand lobby thats why i booked- nice surprise for my boyfriend-NOT!! The upgraded room was bigger and cleaner but still in desperate need of a make over. The hotel owners need to spend their money on rooms not fancy marble(which was lovely in the lobby by the way!) I didnt spend a minute longer than we had to in the hotel and it was a real let down. The "candid photos" taken by other travellers in the hotel were exactly what we faced. Horrible. It was about 120 a night for 2 people and you can get a much nicer place elsewhere in New york so unless you are guarenteed a newly decorated room- do not go there!!,aberdeenlass1903
UR10040824,2007-4-October,Ugly smelly poor decor poor lighting got burned in the shower the tv remote didn't work overpriced no wired or wireless in the rooms felt unsafe in dark the hallways -- what more can I say. The ONLY redeeming quality was the staff. Absolutely the worst hotel I have ever stayed in...ever...anywhere.,PAMinNY
UR6718351,2007-31-January,This is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. I am disgusted in the fact that this hotel is offering rooms out in the condition they are in. The room was tiny dirty and mouldy. There were large amounts of paint peeling off and mildew and mould on the ceiling. We had a visitor by night a little mouse! Our room backed onto six lifts so that's all we could hear ALL night! The ice machine was near our room and the platform that you would place your bucket on was broken so that you could see inside it looked like it hadn't been cleaned ever there were cigarette butts dust and cups inside it. Someone had been sick outside it one night and it hadn't been cleaned up 16 hours later!. The one thing to it's credit is that it's location is good and that you don't spend much time in it!. Please if possible stay away from this hotel as it will ruin your holiday!,myzzpyggi
UR12155603,2007-31-December,I arrived in New York first time ever there. When we arrived we were greeted by the valet parking guy. We carried our luggage inside and began our long long wait to be checked in. Busy time of the year and they only had 2 associates checking people in. Finally after checking in we received our room key and we began our journey to the 12th floor. We arrived to our room and the room was adequate and clean. We then went on about our day and slept there that night. Woke up in the morning and I called the front desk asking what the latest check out time was. They advised we could stay in the room until 1pm. We went out shopped came back to find that our door room key no longer opened our door. I called the front desk in distress because our personal belongings were locked inside the room and they advised us to go down stairs to 5000 club. We went down there and waited waited and waited for the one man behind the desk to talk on the phone and move slower than slow. We finally got our turn and he issued up aother room card. We went up gathered our belongings and back downstairs to check out. We called for our car while in the room. We came down and again waited and waited for they same one man who eventually checked us out. We then waited and waited for our vehicle. The vehicle arrived and the valet paking guy "Paul" advised that we owed 40.00 for parking. I then informed him that we paid it already with the room. He said no go inside and again I went inside to the bell Captain who advised he did't understand what "Paul" was talking about and escorted me back outside. Him and Paul spoke and again I was directed back inside to see the slow man in Club 5000. Again I waited and waited until he finally advised me that I owe 40.00 for parking which I was not aware of. He had no personality or helpfulness to him. He just kept saying 40.00  40.00 we can charge it to same credit card. I had no choice but to pay it against my will. I then went outside with my new receipt and handed it to Paul. Paul then said no I need the receipt and I said no I want it for my records......he then once again sent me inside....again I waited and waited fianlly the bell Capain went and made a copy for me. I went ouside once again and Paul fianlly handed me my car keys we loaded up the car and drove off. Paul was obviously waiting for his tip. The tip is this........Provide better check in service stick to youre word to hold the room open till 1pm when promising people advise people up front of a "parking fee" and have more staff to accomidate the customers. Train the staff on customer services excluding the maid service which were the friendliest of all in the Hotel. I would love to know where any manger was for I seen none.,quickcop
UR8590614,2007-31-August,We stayed at the Pensylvania Hotel from Aug7th/Aug16th inst. and it wasn't a good experience. Everything is difficult at this huge monster of a hotel. The reception is indifferent and there are huge lines everytime you need any information or help from the staff. They even locked our doors one day because we had used the room telephone and I had to go back to the reception 3 times to have someone come and open my room for me. I don't recommend to anyone over 25 since it is quite like a hostel and not a hotel as they claim to be.,Sarment0
UR10445478,2007-30-October,This place is absolutely disgusting. Paint peeling off the bathroom blood stains in the corridoor carpet the stench the rusted door frames the disgusting dirty ratshit filled air conditioner. I can go on and on. I can't see how the New York authorities let this place stay open it really is a hive dump . My cats poo box is more hygienic I have stayed at over 500 hotel rooms in the last 7 years THIS IS THE ABSOLUTE WORST!! Dont believe me look at the pictures. Keep your socks on when walking on the carpet. Sanitise your clothes when finished. Also got sick of washing my hands in the bathtub because the basin tap wouldnt work. Please do not waste your money we cancelled and stayed at the hotel milennium times square instead real class real luxury business grade hotel and only cost us $50.00 per night more. Location!! Ha  you're in new york !! anywhere between 5th and 7th and between 33 and 48 "IS THE LOCATION" To all of you who give this place more than 1 star or make any comment that it is ok positive location etc it would have been cleaner staying at the train station accross the road. Please do not make good comments if you arent a regular traveller a hotel should be so clean you can eat ice cream off the toilet seat. I felt sick breathing the air in this HOLE! No seriously please dont waste your money. D o NOT stay at this hotel. You will get a totally incorrect perception and view of the affordable quality that is available in new york. Ps warn yourself warn your friends mate warn your enemies no one deserves to part with their hard earned money on this rip off  nuff said!!,Goodboy4444
UR7716331,2007-30-May,Don't stay at this squalid place! The rooms are FILTHY. Our bath was constantly half full of backed up disgusting waste! We couldn't use the shower for fear of catching something from the slurry. The hotel was full for Memorial day and we couldn't change rooms - nor were we given discount (returned from trip this morning - 30 May 2007). Also the bed linen and towels smelled horrid and carpet was revolting. We are seasoned travellers who visit India and the sub-continent regularly. We stay in very basic accomodation there and we have never experienced such filth as we have at the Pennsylvania. The rooms are a major health hazard. STAY THERE AT YOUR PERIL!,Kag5
UR12067027,2007-30-December,Well honestly it was not THAT bad. Initially I was a bit scared to check into this hotel after reading all the nightmarish reviews other people had posted. However my fears were somewhat assuaged when a friend recommended this hotel primarily because of its location. Since he'd been to New York numerous times each time staying at the Hotel Pennsylvania I thought he'd be a reliable source. True to his word the location really can't be beat. With a rail/subway hub right across the street and the Empire State Building right down the street it could not get any more convenient. Granted the building itself was a bit shady. Public bathrooms downstairs were pathetic to the point that after walking in I walked right out preferring to use the bathroom in my room instead. Also the main waiting area on each floor looked like something out of a ghost story. (I later found out that the condition of the waiting area was a good indication of the condition of the rooms on the floor which would explain why some people got it very good and some not.) Staff were both mean and friendly depending on who you talked to. As far as the room goes though it was really really OK. Although I did notice some wires hanging out of the wall a vent without a grating some rust on the pipes underneath the sink and a heating apparatus that was a joke it wasn't like anything wasn't working. Overall the room was clean and tidy though definitely nothing to brag about. Then again the price I paid was a bit much for what I'm used to especially given the no-frills nature of the hotel so unless I need to be 100% centrally located the next time I'm in New York I probably won't stay there again.,pianodog3
UR10035425,2007-3-October,The 1st room I was given was as small as a closet mold and filth was every where and I was afraid to enter the bathroom I was so filthy. The second was was worst. It smelled and had dirt and dust all over the air conditioning system. I would like to know what the criteria is that this hotel have for assigning the good and bad rooms. I am sure that they know that most of their rooms are uninhabitable. I'll never stay at this place again. It should be condemed.,StephaniefromVA
UR7542065,2007-3-May,This place is disgusting. I took a group of people there last year for a conference and wished I hadn't. The room looked like nobody had been in it to revamp or clean since the 1950s. There were stains on the walls and holes in the doors. There was a horrid smell in my room and others in my party made similar comments and worse. We stayed here because we wanted to all be in one place and this place is huge so it was one of the few places we were able to book. Half way through our stay I moved to another hotel roughly the same price and bang in the middle of times square. It was a tiny place and a tiny room but very clean and much more up to date. The others stayed behind as they were unable to find anywhere else to stay. Disaster - stay away!,tripmonsters
UR6546125,2007-3-January,I don't often write reports on sites like these but Ive just got back from the Pennsylvania Hotel New York and though this deserved one...... People are being far too polite this was the dirtiest most run down hotel I have ever been to. We go away every New Years Eve and always book early; we booked this hotel in Feb 2006 and arrived on Dec 29th for four nights. After a long day's travelling we just wanted to relax quick shower etc then hit the sights of New York. 3 hrs later we did!! The first room we checked into was tiny and very dusty. The bathroom didn't look as if it had been cleaned in months and there was a packet of condoms on the bedside table!! The second third and fourth rooms we were shown were in similar states of disrepair furniture legs missing dirty furniture stale smells in alleged "non smoking" rooms etc. We eventually demanded a refund and to be re-located. The reception staff offered us an "upgrade" to a clean room when we inspected this room it was clean but still not three star standard We accepted the room but refused to pay the $50 per night upgrade fee (I don't see why you should have to pay extra for cleanliness!!) This wasn't just us being fussy brits either; there was a long queue of complainants by the time we came back down. So I guess in summary if you have to stay here then request to see other rooms 1152 was the one we ended up in. Great location needs closing down fumigating decorating and re-launching. I won't be going back!!,b8njw
UR11228257,2007-3-December,By far the single worst hotel I have ever come across. I'm not a big stickler when it comes to hotels because most 1 star hotels have better rooms than this place and a pleasant auro and smell. My wife cried when we entered. Rat stench urine smell in the hallway. nasty bathroom. I felt like I was holed up in a drug and prostitution den. I am not kidding here. Really bad. If you do stay hear and have a room overlooking the street be prepared for a sleepless night due to the noise of traffic outside eminating through the drafty windows. Made you feel home sick like you were in a b-movie horror flick. Stay in NJ and commute in to the city or stay in CT. or spend an arm and a leg for a somewhat decent hotel. BUT PLEASE DON"T SPEND ALOT OF MONEY FOR THIS DUMP!!!!!,travelgus
UR7276102,2007-3-April,I have recently returned from staying at the Penn Hotel NYC and if your thinking of staying here I can give you one word of advice....DON'T! I too was confused due to the mixed bag of feedback I had read online. To be honest from my experiences it does seem to be the luck of the draw with this hotel as to whether you get a reasonable room or a dundgeon this very shabby hotel is slowly improving on the 11th 12th and 13th floors.....do not be taken in by the grand lobby! Upon my arrival after a fourteen hour journey from the UK I was greeted by a further 45 minute wait having to line up for check in at reception. Reception was manned by only two very slow disinterested demotivated totally fed up individuals who couldn't even raise a smile. Next is where my nightmare began. The room I was given was on the eighth floor which resembled a rabbit hutch with an outside wall for a view....upon complaining the next day I was given a larger room on the tenth floor which I was prepared to live with untill I discovered it was already occupied! Wait for it! another person I hear you think? Not so lucky I'm afraid no less than a RAT running along the floor and disappearing behind the air con unit. I did see it three times so I was in no doubt......(Lord help the next guests to occupy this room) when I reported this at 6am the best they could do was to send a guy who stuffed towels along the front of the air con unit....I have no idea what that was suppose to achieve. anyway I was then roomless for the next seven hours waiting for guests to check out in order to be given my third room thanks to Miss Vivian which was better but with 24hr noise and the window filthy. I am amazed that given the large number of guests this hotel has that the management do not use their initiative to bring this old hotel up to date. Guests do not even get a complimentary cup of coffee in the rooms and not a flower in sight. Extremely disappointing!,Alan A
UR8026546,2007-29-June,my husband and I had just finished a cruise and decide to spend 3 days in NY. This is the WORST hotel we have ever stayed in had I not pre paid the room we would have stayed elsewhere. Looks like a prison camp with big horrible metal scratched doors. 1ST ROOM woke up the next morning covered in bite marks from BED BUGS and itching all over. My husband waited 40 mins at reception just to speak to someone to get us moved. 2ND ROOM filthy graffiti on walls ripped carpets smelling of urine mouldy shower. I wouldnt have had a shower in there if you paid me!. My husband again waited 45 mins in another queue to get the room changed again. 3RD ROOM best of a bad lot still smelt of urine mouldy shower ripped carpet very noisy a/c view of another side of a building. Reception staff couldnt care less and our complaints seem to be common from guests at this hotel they just move you to another room until you finally give up and stay in a filthy room anyway. Dont think you are getting a good deal because of the price your not. Its cheap and nasty.,sonnyek
UR11119361,2007-28-November,My non stay was in February 06. Was not a member of trip advisor at time. But thought guests should know what awaits them. Horrible hotel. Waited for over an hour to just check in. Was visiting NY for business with sister  had been staying elsewhere but decided to stay an extra day to see sights and pay my own room fees. Sister's first time in NY I am frequent NY guest but normally stay elsewhere. After checking in finally no one would assist with luggage my sister was pregnant we had to haul luggage ourselves. Hallway was disgusting doors reinforced reminded me of being in the bowels of a military ship. Room was disgusting smelled carpet dirty mold in room bathroom dirty hair on floor. Old decor from 70's. Television did not work. View of alley. Lock on door did not work properly no phone in room. Requested two doubles got a Queen. My sister was actually afraid to sit on bed she also started to have panic attack. She was afraid to stay in room. I literally had to take her outside to calm her down she refused to stay in hotel. We ended up leaving hotel after less than an hour. Hotel refused to refund any portion of money and were unsympathetic refused to move rooms. We ended up flying home that evening on late flight experience spoiled mood and hard to find room in NY on last minute notice.,wendypooh9
UR7710041,2007-28-May,The travel agent did say there had been a few problems with decor etc....but hey my house isnt exactly perfect either. So we booked... no long queues. went up to the room....Room seemed fine beds comfy etc.unpacked very quickly to see the sights and out we went...no problems. Arrived back and into bedI was preparing our day ahead when I spotted something out of the corner of my eye(assumed it was tiredness)Then again and again. The only thing I can describe it asis a silver coloured newt type insectmoving v fast along the wall.We left the room and went to reception(avoid the queues by heading straight to security or other staff and demanding the manager) My mistake was standing in the queue in my pyjamas(hey I was tired and v pissed off and told everyone in the queue) then when I was finally given an alternative room I went running to check it out. My God the rooms are all dodgy.I was told I had an upgrade(ok double beds but the lights did not work and there was a hole in the wall)The only satisfaction I got was by politely demanding to see the manager and have him take me to a decent room..All sorted.Even the bell boy who helped me to pack our belongings told me that the hotel was infested with vermininsects etc and each day they have to relocate at least half the bookings and those people still are not happy....Not worth the hasslethere are lots of better hotels in new york for a few xtra dollars..Would not recomend this place to anyone and I have been backbacking aroung europeasiaafricaaustralia.Would stay in a hostel quicker than that dump...Please take my advice and cancel. If not I hope you are one of the lucky ones.... Good Luck,IrelandChristine
UR8245873,2007-28-July,We booked a Penn 5000 room -- and the dedicated check-in process went quite smoothly. However for those who had not paid the extra charge for the "premium" rooms the line for the standard rooms was not a pretty sight. I have yet to find out how --other than the quick check-in and the access to the club room-- the "premium" rooms differed from the standard. Both the rooms we had --the first had no phone service so we asked for a transfer; the second was missing light bulbs-- were small and well worn. These are premium rooms? The only redeeming feature is that hotel staff responded quickly to our "comments"; unfortunately they were totally unable to help us. When we were there there were two computers in the club room -- both loaded with pornography. The club room TV was on the WB and no one from the hotel could find a remote or other way to change the channel. The hotel's website indicates that there is not only a a separate check-in but also a separate elevator ([--]). We asked and asked but we never found anyone who had heard of the separate elevator service. I've seen reports that the Penn is scheduled to be demolished to make way for an office complex. I would hate to see this happen; however I would also hate to see the Penn continue to operate as it has in the past few years. It's time for the Penn and its owners to either fish or cut bait. Either they should restore this hotel to its glory days or they should consign it to the dust heap.,schnauzerlady
UR10381889,2007-27-October,hi i stayed in this hotel for a shopping trip to newyork we just slept there and even that was too much great location but woke up to find some kind of rodent had eaten a hole in my hand bag the corridors were dark and dirty in this hotel and it stank. I would not recommend this hotel but I loved newyork and the people were fab and so helpful. I will be returning in august but staying in a different hotel which heres hoping is better than the last.,triciabkildare
UR8004374,2007-27-June,My boyfriend and I and another couple went to america for two weeks - only back since Sunday. We went to LA first and then on to Vegas finishing our trip with four days of shopping in New York. We had pre booked everything through an agent so our hotels were already paid for. On arrival at the hotel we had to join a queue for about 30 mins. They could have easily had more workers checking ppl in. I specifically called the hotel the previous week requesting our rooms be located together and that we would be travellin a long day and would appreciate nice rooms. MY GOD !!! The rooms we got were horrific. The doors are like space shuttle doors the air con was like a tractor - the smell of urine and dirt was unreal. The place was filthy. I went downstairs to complain and we got moved to a different floor where the rooms were even worse!! I had enough at this point as we were nearly at the hotel 2.5 hours and still hadnt got to sit down. I went back downstairs and spoke with a very nice lady in reservations and explained the whole thing to her - I said that only for the fact that we were pre paid through an agent we would be out the door. she moved the four of us in to a 2 bedroomed penthouse suite which was a bit dated but perfect for us and most importantly fresh and clean. The location of this hotel is fantastic 10 minute walk to times sq and across the rd from penn station. The shopping aroudn the hotel as well is ideal. But my advice to anyone who is staying here - be very carefull - u may think ur getting a deal but u certainly are not.,Dawnywawny
UR10007047,2007-26-September,This hotel was smelly dirty disgusting and should be condemned. We had to switch rooms three times (first one had no running water second one had a leak in the ceiling) and even the third room was dirty dingy and musty. I will never in my life stay at this hotel again and wouldn't wish an evening here on my worst enemy. To top it all off I left a pair of expensive jeans in the closet and called a few hours after my departure and was told that they were not there. So some cleaning lady got very lucky that day.... I could go on and on about how terrible this experience was. Trust me just stay away.,JetSetScarlett
UR10355452,2007-26-October,Worst experience I have ever had in my 49 years. at 300+ dollars a night when I walked into the room I exspected to see a taped outline of a body. I am not a prude and I understand that NY is exspensive but absolutely don't stay here. They attempted to put us in a suite for a 100.00 upgrade but it was even worse. The suite had 3 bedrooms with a common living room. The funny thing about it was they told me that they might have to rent the other bedrooms out which I was kind of OK with but once you came in the front door of the suite you could not lock the the individual bedrooms. You got to be kidding!!!!! We moved to the Marriot Residence Inn Time Square for 45 more dollars a night and what a relief. To top it of they tried to charge me for one night until I told them that I would refuse the charge with AMEX. If you stay there make sure you take the lysol and house shoe because you will not want to walk on the carpet bare footed. Better than that take a tent and stay in C. Park!!!!!!,robyt
UR8001984,2007-26-June,In all my travels to NYC I have stayed at over seven different hotels. Never have I seen anything like this. As soon as we walked in our room we didn't even sit our bags down before turning around going back downstairs and demanding a better room. We were upgraded to a "suite" but I use that term very loosely. Thank God for Expedia. It was because we booked through them that we were able to get a King room. Honestly I have seen better quality in a Super 8. Everything was filthy (floors bedspread walls bathroom) and the staff was incredibly rude. But I guess with all the complaints they get every day who wouldn't be? There are so many other nice and affordable places to stay in NY...don't make the mistake of staying in this rat hole.,iheartnyc_7
UR11971845,2007-26-December,to tour operators.Also shame on tour operators for not viewing what they are selling.Arrogant staff who were most unhelpful.We had to pay 50 dollars per night for an upgrade for the "executive rooms"which were just adequate.The room we were given initially was in a delapitated state with cracked plaster and a shower room that was in such poor condition that one would hesitate to use it.Don't touch it.,Cymac
UR10004432,2007-25-September,I think we would only go back to this hotel because of the location. We were going to a concert at Madison Square Garden which was located across the street. Our check-in went great but when we stepped off the elevator to our room on the 3rd floor we thought we were in a scary movie. Our room was clean but really needed updating. There were too many other doors to other rooms....mold in the bathroom...exposed light fixtures on the ceiling..... The hotel is very busy maybe there are other rooms that are better?,mln
UR11948648,2007-25-December,My sister and I stayed at this hotel in November. The check in was okay and they let us check in early. A bit of advice - if they tell you you are to early and have to come back don't go to the diner attached to the hotel to wait as it is soooooo expensive and eating in New York is reasonably cheap. The hotel pics paint a nice picture but the corridors and rooms are soooooo run down I was amazed and so disappointed!!! I thought Americans had high standards as they complain about everything in other countries but this hotel was not good. I cant believe how many guests it holds how busy it is and how shabby it is. Dont stay here if you have any allergies or are asthmatic as it will probably hospitalise you and I am not exaggerating. The walls and carpets are all stained. The ac and heater are disgusting and covered in rust. There is mould everywhere. Oh I could go on! The only good thing is the location and the fact that it is relatively cheap by New York standards. However I have been to NYC several times and would advise staying in a nice hotel a bit further outside town if you cant afford the waldorf but want to stay somewhere nice as the subways are a great way to whiz around and the taxis arent to expensive. A couple of touristy things to do include the obvious - A show on Broadway. Book a ticket directly at the theatre as they are much cheaper. - The station island ferry is free. - Macys and tiffanys is a must. - Bubba Gumps on Times Square is great for dinner one night and have the shrimp platter - $20 and its amazing. Plus they do strawberry daiquiris - China town is a must for your fakes (you have to get off the subway at the canal street stop) - Soho has great shops Avoid NY in the summer as it gets really hot and is not the best idea if you are shopping or dragging a boyfriend/husband around with you. April/May is a great time to go as is the winter months running up to xmas as it gets very festive. If you want a prolonged stay or to get some sunbathing in either head to the hamptons or jump on a plane for 60 return from New York to Miami!,TravellingBegg
UR7431768,2007-25-April,For location it would be hard to beat this hotel with the westside subway across the road and the eastside subway one block away. Most of the tourist honey-traps are within reasonable walking distance. The hotel itself is worn and tired. Our room was on the 9th floor poorly lit adequately furnished but with a poorly fitting window cracked paintwork and worn bathroom fittings. The staff were good but morale seemed low. The internet business facility is terrible. The price looks reasonable but half the PCs were never working the response time was very slow with requests being lost some of the time requiring a restart. The reception staff are well aware of the problem and raised it with the management but they take no action.,mgtHants
UR10274310,2007-24-October,As some others have said it was a great location but terrible property. You felt like you were in a hospital that was refurbed into a hotel. Its hard to get your head around the price in New York for what you get and this hotel was no exception. Luckily we were only there to sleep and were out most of the 4 days we were there. If your into enjoying the hotel this isnt the place. It was little more than a glorified backpackers.,Reuben-Kincaid
UR8226121,2007-24-July,im only back from NYC and we booked the pennsylania hotal  please please please dont stay here. there is urine on the walls and on the floors the beds are stained and the smell is HORRIFIC  I WOULD NOT PUT A DOG IN THIS SO CALL HOTEL.. if you have booked to go there i would advised you to cancel NOW! I spoke to the manager and he couldn care less. we walked out and never got a refund $700.00 dollers for 3 nights a joke . please dont go here you will be sick. jennifer ireland,EgyptJen
UR8494604,2007-24-August,The holes in the curtains were bigger than the windows We sleep with the open a little because it was broken. We found little "friends animals" in bed. Reception desk employees need training badly to work with people. The conforters were so old it has holes. Painting work done in the bathroom were very cheap. Workers should be supervise when doing this work door borders and hangers were painted with the same wall paint instead of being change. In the morning water in the sink were red.,RaquelCayey
UR11013987,2007-23-November,By far the worst place I have ever stayed at. The room smelled of smoke and you could not open a window. The walls were covered in mold my sheets were dirty they smelled of someone elses perfume and had goop on them. When I asked for clean sheets they showed up and dropped the clean sheets on the floor and left. Oh and the floors were sticky. When I took a shower I had to stand on my tippy toes because the tub was so dirty and disgusting. I had two nights stay and made it through one night because I had no other choice and they would not switch my room. I paid $280 per night at this place. TAKE MY ADVICE AND FIND ANOTHER PLACE TO STAY.,shannon7212
UR7420733,2007-23-April,First of all the hotel's location is great! Next door to macy's and manhattan mall. Few blocks away to times square. The room we stayed in had stains on the carpet.The bad part was it was about 70 degress out very warm and there was NO AC in the building...including the rooms..I asked if they could spare us a fan since my 2 yr old couldn't fall asleepit was so warm. All they could do was open the windows and well that was worse coz you could hear everything from the streets and smell everything too! Oh and i asked why they didn't have any AC on...they told me they couldn't control mother nature!! I asked a friend who was staying in hotel nearby if they had AC..and they did...so what did mother nature have to do with that? If you're planning to stay there anytime soon and its warm out do call them ahead of time and ask if they have AC..also ask for newly renovated rooms or else you get a tiny room with no fridge. Let them know you have kids too so they'll give you a bigger room. A MUST TO LET THEM KNOW WHAT YOU NEED.,honeynutsherios
UR7966755,2007-22-June,My boyfriend took me to NY for the first time for my birthday on May 26th he chose the Hotel Pennsylvania for our weekend stay. What can I say besides absolutley horrible!? We waited almost an hour to check in and went upstairs to the 12th floor to out "250 sq ft" room (which is still tiny). The hotel is old dirty and smells. Everything is outdated. The doors to the rooms look like bomb shelters. Big heavy metal doors and you have to step down into the room like you are going in a bomb shelter. We opened the door and the door hit the tv stand we turned to the left and had to squuze past the bed we went into the moldy nasty bathroom and ran right out. We had a great view of a brick wall. The room was a shoebox. You couldnt open the closet door all the way because it hit the mini fridge which was on the floor next to the tv stand. The air was broken for 1 1/2 out of the 2 days we stayed there. We called the manager & said the room was supposed to be 250 sq ft. He said "not all of the standard rooms are 250 some are 100 sq feet you are still in a standard room which is what you paid for." We asked to be moved they would not do anything about it. We were mad but thought "oh well we just have to sleep here we will be out the whole time". Well then my bf went to use his travel money visa the prepaid money card and there was nothing left on it. He said there should be $200 still. We called & it said the room took out an extra $150 from his card. We called downstairs and they said they charged his card $150 in case we order any movies. WHAT!? That is ridiculous anyway AND this is a cash card they took all of his spending money. We tried to get it refunded someone told us to call at 9am and the manager would do it. We called at 9am and the manager told us it would take 5 business days after the holiday to refund the money. The place was just horrible & disgusting there were stains all over the walls & floors. We also called the manager about the dirty moldy bathroom and they sent a maid up to spray it with bleach. The maid told us they paint over the mold in the shower but it usually washes away in 2 weeks thats why it's there again. Great excuse. We paint over the mold. My advice....................stay far away from this place. For $200-300 a night for a standard room I would rather sleep on the street then stay here.,Erika52385
UR10969355,2007-21-November,Before you book be warned this hotel is a dump!! It's big it's old the staff whilst friendly are still working as if it's still the 50's!!! But for the price you can't go wrong. The hotel is slap bang in the centre of New York. There are plenty of taxis generally outside to get you whereever you can't walk to. If you're visiting New York and just want somewhere clean and dry to lay your head for a few hours each night at a decent price this is your spot!!,Irish_Traveller085
UR7197431,2007-21-March,on arrival we found the hotel to be in a great location very close to all amenities however we found the reception staff to be very unhelpful extremely ignorant and rude. On top of this we found our roon on the 16th floor to be in a distraceful condition 2 single beds which the reception told us to push together although we had a double room booked. It was very dirty and smelled of urine with pubic hairs all over the bathroom dirty floors and well worn beds not the sort of hotel you should find in manhattan. We definitely will not be staying here again and would not recommend it to anyone. Save your money spend it at the Radisson,hollie2007
UR7954977,2007-21-June,I stayed in Hotel Pennsylvania and I must say the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. It was filthy. I asked to use the stairs as my friends got stuck in the lift and I never have seen such dirt in my life. I also had the pleasure to meet not one but two mice at different occasions. Our room was terrible TV didnt work carpet filthy bathroom disgusting. I showered with my shoes on. I have stayed in New York on a few occasions & this was definitley my worst experience. Proximitey to Penn station good but to be honest would rather have stayed in the station.,RebeccaGalway
UR8212652,2007-21-July,We are from Mexico City sorry if our English is not perfect. It was our first visit to NYC and the experience in this hotel was terrible (to say the least). Check-in line was very long and took us about 40 minutes to get our key. Lobby looked old dirty and seemed always crowded. We stayed at a room in the 12th floor and it was so dark that I had to buy a light bulb because the one in the lamp didn't provide enough illumination. The carpet was very old and dirty. The view from our little tiny window was an alley and another very old and tall building preventing daylight to enter the room. Room was small and there was no space for our suitcase. The high amount paid for this scary and creepy hotel felt like a robbery. I have been to Manhattan after that and didn't stay in this hotel. We definitely won't recomend it to our friends and relatives in fact we discourage them to stay here. DO NOT trust the pictures shown in the hotel's website. They have nothing to do with the reality!!! A much better option for budget travelers staying in NYC is the Holiday Inn Express a few blocks away from MSG and the Pennsylvania Hotel.,Fer_Traveler
UR11878950,2007-21-December,My husband and I spent four nights at the hotel (12/15-19/07) and weren't expecting much because of the price - and we were correct in lowering our expectations. We arrived early and couldn't check in but they will graciously store your bags in their dungeon-like basement for $4 each. Check in wasn't a problem. The hotel corridors and rooms are stale and smelly. We kept our window cracked the entire time just to get fresh air (highs were in the mid-30's while we were visiting) but it was worth the cold air. Our room was clean but very very dated and overall depressing. The comforter was burned in several spots. Again we knew not to expect much because of the price. The shower had hair in the drain and although the water pressure was good hot water was NON EXISTANT. My complaints were ignored. Don't waste your money on upgrading to include the "breakfast" - it consisted of OJ coffee/tea and a very small selection of stale pastries and bagels. There was no fruit bottle water yogurt - nothing else. Also the night manager (Mirium) called to wake me up one night so she could get a copy of my credit card so that she could close her books. OK give me a break! No messages were left no notes nothing during the day - we had given the hotel our credit card and both of our cell numbers at check in. But instead of trying to contact us politely the rude manager calls to wake me up to get my credit card. She was unbelievably unapologetic and rude. We weren't in the hotel much thank goodness but on our next trip to NYC we will DEFINITELY spend a little more money to get a better hotel. This one is not worth cutting corners on I don't care how great the location. Dirty noisy and rude.,kcounter
UR7940124,2007-20-June,I have stayed in a lot of hotels over the years and I can without doubt say that this was the worse one ever. We checked in and went up to our room which had not been made up from the previous occupants. I went back down and complained and was given another room which was disgusting so again I went down and complained and got another room. This happened 5 times and the only reason we stopped was that I couldnt take it any more. The staff were not at all helpful  they did not seem to think that what was happening was at all unusual or unacceptable. We ended up with a room that had a dirty bathroom the carpet was stained and filthy the paint was coming off the walls the tiles were broken and the sinks and tubs stained. There was also always a queue at reception so every time you wanted to talk to them you were looking at a 10-15 minute wait. The only thing about this hotel that was any good was the location but it just wasnt worth it.,TravelCork
UR6629458,2007-20-January,This was our second stay - and think the last. Hotel has got worse needs cleaning up. One of our party had to be moved three times due to Mice Cockroches and was'nt the room they had asked and payed for. Spoke to people arriving and they were disgusted could'nt believe the state of some rooms really is luck some rooms seam to be ok and others just terrible! We had small children with us and one was very ill due to eating food in the area. Brilliant location and central to every thing - Macy's just at the corner and the empire state is 10min walk. Its just a pity they would'nt clean the hotel up nothing fancy just CLEAN! because you should'nt really spend much time in your room there's too much to see and do! Just LOVE NYC!,belfast61
UR6817723,2007-20-February,The lobby is a complete decoy to what your room is going to be. I walked in and thought "Yes this is beautiful I can't wait to stay." I paid my money and 1st got the wrong room. Then when I got to the right room. The hallways alone were dissapointing. Run down stained shabby. I entered my room to find peeling paint stained sheets a broken window a dirty USED bathroom (toilet paper was almost gone and the toilet itself looked liked it had been "broken in" for me. For the price I paid it was not worth it. It was disturbing actually. Then at the end of the day they over charged me twice and i've yet to get my security deposit back. Overall I could have stayed in the projects where i was from for that kind of living. THIS PLACE SUCKED!! Mimi NYC,Bigmamamimi
UR8458059,2007-20-August,I know it was a while since i stayed there but i know people who have recently returned and i dont think it has changed at all! We arrived in Dec obviously very very busy. Many people had been double booked had no rooms so i think on that account we were lucky. The lobby was beautiful all marble and shiney the lifts recently refurbished with TV's in them we thought we had dropped on. Then we got to our floor think it was 15 or something it was like a different hotel! It was in urgent need of decoration it smelt musty and the carpets were rotten. The only thing new was the door locks which had been changed to the swipe card type. We opened the door to the room and it didn't improve. The floor very dirty couln't walk around without shoes on. Couldn't see out of the window as it was that dirty. The bathroom however was dated but it had been cleaned i could smell bleach and it became bareable. I checked the bed and the linen was clean also. It was a base in an ideal location for all the attractions but i am glad we only stayed 3 nights. The room was that grotty i slept with the light on each night as i was convinced the cockroaches would come out (a couple of months earlier and i believe they would think we were only saved by the cold weather). During our stay we visited a couple of other floors many the same but a couple obviously recently refurbished and quite nice. As some of the other people have said they thought it was ok but they had upgraded. If you have booked i would urge you to upgrade when you get there or even stay somewhere else. If it had not been 2 weeks before christmas i would of gone and booked into another hotel and paid twice only everywhere was booked. I would not recommend it at all as there are hotels for similar price nearer times square etc... this is what i have learned since i have also learned to fully research where i am staying in future without booking first!,clarabell_55
UR8605596,2007-2-September,We've been here for 4 times. The first two stays were perfect: large newly renovated rooms. The last time we were here (februari '07) the room was extremely small and not as clean (seemed like the renovation had worn off). This time I asked for a big room upon checkin which the clerk said we would get. Well we didn't: same small room same worn bathroom. Since checkin already took about 1 hour (you have to stand in line for that long!) I didn't bother to ask for another room. Service seems to have degraded over time: no more free morning newspapers and when the TV remote didn't seem to work a guy came to change the batteries which didn't help since it was broke. He just shrugged and said: "well OK" and walked off... We asked for an extra pillow which the maid supervisor said we would get but we didn't get one and had to ask again around 22:00... In-room internet didn't work: the cable was there the TV had a screen saying: "press menu to access internet". So back to the concierge wait another 1 hour in line just to be told: "If it doesn't work it doesn't work". It looks like the rumours of a future demolition of the hotel are causing the staff to care less and less for their guests. If you go here just don't expect anything except for a stay in The Greatest City in the World then you'll be fine. We'll probably give Ramada New Yorker another try though as it's almost in the same location.,matthijst
UR6902013,2007-2-March,I live in the city but when my mom came in for a day of sightseeing she asked me to book a room here for one night for the sake of convenience. I was really hesitant because of the price. And with good reason. The bathroom was clean enough. Shower pressure rocked. One of the two headboards in our room was completely askew. Looked horrible and made me wonder. No sign of bed bugs (thank god--I've had them in an apartment and they are the stuff of nightmares) but I did find lipstick/nailpolish? on the bedspread and sheets. Overall the room and the hallways skeeved me out. If I were a 20-yr. old college student trying to save cash I wouldn't have a problem staying there again. I'm not. The reception-desk staff was rude. Worse--they charge $4 a bag to hold luggage after you check out. Seriously? And you have to go down to the skeevy lower level to put it away yourself. Here's the weird thing--the most friendly positive service we experienced was from the bag-check guys in the basement. Seriously--they were polite and professional. So--it's a money saver. That can definitely be a great thing in NYC. But the whole scene is so darn depressing I'd never recommend it to anyone.,rachelpink
UR8823648,2007-19-September,This is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. The first room smelled strongly of sewer and was filthy. We ask to be moved and the second room that we moved too was even worse. It had electrical wires exposed at the baseboard. There were no light fixtures...bare bulb's. The hair dryer didn't work the sheets didn't fit the bed and came off constantly. The room was very dirty the aircondition unit had dust and debris in it and when you turned it on it blew all over the room. Security lock on the door was broken. No curtains on the windows. No smoke or fire detectors. This hotel is in need of serious updating and is presently a danger to your health and your life. I would not recommend ever staying in this hote. The date of our stay 9/11/07-9/12/07,GlennZA
UR8190433,2007-19-July,This hotel was the worst place on Earth. The room was very old and dirty. The bothroom did not have a hair dryer the towels were stained and the window in the bathroom was open and would not close.The furniture was very out dated and did not look like the pictures on the website. After complaining they offered us another room where the window would not close and when we attempted to close the window it fell out. The lobby is a mess and crowded with lots of children who were traveling with high school groups. There is no security and anyone was allowed to take the elevator up. Overall this place is not worth the money you will save. If you want to enjoy your trip to New York spend the extra money and stay in a nice clean place.,brandi77
UR6622030,2007-19-January,Arrived at Hotel Pennsylvania for a weeks stay in December to do some shopping in New York and can't fault the location. Right next to Maceys. Hotel reception was lovely staff average. Had booked a twin room but we're given a double room with no choice of changing as all twins were booked up. The room itself was horrendous and we're only lucky we didnt spend too much time in it. Paint was peeling off the walls there was damp marks and one night there was definately the sounds of something scurrying around on the floor. Plus sleep was made difficult by the fact that you could hear everyone else on the same floor. Went with a friend and the city was amazing so much to do but I would definately not go back to the Pennsylvania Hotel they should pay you to stay there!,LynseyJ
UR6812272,2007-19-February,I have never come across such a horrible hotel. We came to NYC from FLorida as part of our Holiday. Drew up outside and thought WOW what a great hotel and location. this didn't last long when we were eventually shown to our rooms. Not only was there paint peeling of the ceiling part of the ceiling was missing!!!! Unfortunately I dont have any photos as I didnt want to stay any long er than necessary. After showing us several rooms all just as disgusting but larger we checked out and found a lovely hotel just behind this one called the standford hotel. Just the same price but much superior. Do yourself a favour and stay away from the Pennsylvannia Hotel.,tates
UR8751624,2007-18-September,I was sent to NYC on a rush on a business trip for three days we booked at 11.30PM and our reservation was not in order and the front desk service was less than helpfull when we finally checked in we find a dated room with a terrible smell of dampness a lousy reception on the tv set no remote ditry carpets and a terrible view of the back of a building. Even when it was a business trip we expected more for the US300 rate. Eusebio Balderas,Eusebio1970
UR10089754,2007-17-October,It is nearly a year since I stayed in this hotel but was not a TripAdvisor member at that time. However my experience was so bad I felt it necessary to post a review. The foyer is like a train station which is very un-inviting. You are assigned to your room of which I would say there are thousands you get off the lift on your floor and are given the impression of a corridor of jail cells. Our room was so bad I would not even sit on the bed as I felt it was dirty. The bathroom was damp and the plaster was falling off the walls. It was raining heavily outside and I actually cried with the thought that I would have to spend the night in the hotel. My partner went back to reception and request that his credit card be credited as we were checking out. The receptionist did ask why and when told said the room could be upgraded but we would have to pay the extra cost. We did not stay!! The hotel has not redeeming features only that it is very centrally located. My advice is not to stay here I have never been in or seen such a dreadful hotel.,FishDublin_Ireland
UR7615255,2007-14-May,My travel department made a mistake with my trip to New York - I was supposed to be at the Hotel Dream but when I got there they had the wrong dates confirmed for me. I was directed to use a lobby computer to use hotels.com to find something...in a panic I went with this hotel (paying $380 per night instead of $2160 at some luxury chain) - you know how it is with New York never a room when you need one. When I arrived I knew it was going to be grim. It was pretty late at night at the desk people all looked like they hadn't bathed in a month and were the most miserable group of people...I really can't go into all the details it would take me too long. The room was really a joke - more peeled paint on the ceiling and bath-tub than paint left. It was one of those rooms where you don't want to walk bare foot. Massive crack in the sink curtains that wouldn't close and hanging off the curtain rod...no internet except in the lobby for some extortionate rate. I don't know if it's a "crack" hotel as others claim - but it is a place where entire families are living in rooms - you can tell by the noise the people coming and going. Location is all that's going for this place - but seriously - avoid it at all costs if you can - I know you're only sleeping there but it would put a damper on your trip to New York if you do.,aliwally
UR7161490,2007-14-March,Don't let the great location and the lure of the price fool you into staying at this disgusting hotel. When I arrived in my room it smelled like straight up body odor the air conditioning didn't work and the bathroom was stained with brown spots from head to toe. My friends who were staying a few floors up from us got the unfortunate surprise of blood stains on their sheets and in their bathtub so I guess I shouldn't complain too much. My suggestion? Spend a few extra bucks for a nicer hotel. The Hotel Penn isn't worth the savings.,dcpiano
UR6788262,2007-14-February,Hotel prices in Manhattan are on the insane side so most people will take anything they can get less than $200. Hotel Penn fits this niche. Yes you have a room right in the middle of things and right next to Penn Station. But the quality of everything from the beds linens and towels to the showers were quite poor. I only needed a room for one night and I would not want to stay here longer than a weekend.,BrianNJ
UR8708960,2007-13-September,Location was good but it is not value for the money. We stayed three nights  at an average of US$275/night for one room. We were late arriving by train into Penn station and had no hotel booked and it was the first one we saw. We were too tired to bother trying elsewhere even when we heard the price. The hotel pictures online do not tell the real story. The lobby is impressive but it deteriorates from there. Our room was dingy (but clean) down the end of a long corridor on the 8th floor. Bathroom fittings were antiquated and need upgrading. Noise from night time roadworks and traffic was disturbing. The lesson is do more homework and book in advance.,jaygeeb
UR8111336,2007-13-July,I would recommend this Hotel only to people who really don't care about the condition of the room and just look for a good location. The Hotel is opposite to Madison Square garden and you can go everywhere from Penn station... the NON-service and the crazy price are too bad to make a good recommendation for this HOTEL. I was told from a friend of mine that the Hotel had bad old rooms and new ones so we should have asked for a nicer room in case the first one was bad.... of course for the price 200$ per night we wanted a nice room instead we got a crappy one... people at the desk are machine no human at all we changed room 3 times before I started speaking in spanish with a guy who at the end upgrated our room for free so we stayed 9 nights in a nice room otherwise it would be an HORRIBLE experience... the standard room are stinky dirty and OLD no wardrobe... TERRIBLE! They didn't want to keep us the upgraded room for the last night because we had a different reservation for the lst night so we had to check in together so even tough they had our room still free they gave us the [--] room for the lst night! UNBELIEVABLE!,Italiansinireland
UR8700052,2007-12-September,I live in NY but stayed here with my mom while she was in town for a conference. We didn't have any plans for the weekend except ordering room service and a movie. We could handle the fact that HP doesn't have room service but our remote control didn't work so we couldn't order a movie. I called the desk 3 times before they sent someone up an hour later. When he brought a new remote we found that it didn't work either. To make matters worse the cable kept going out (it wasn't due to weather). We also found blood stains on the sheets and stains on the towels. However it is a good location and has fast elevators.,stalbans1
UR10070418,2007-12-October,While the location of the hotel and the services available around it can not be falted we felt the hotel itself was sub standard. We had two seperate stays over 2 weeks and both times we had to wait a long time to check it around 20-30mins. They had staff on the desk who were not polite not friendly and didn't want to help at all. They also had staff sitting in the room behind reception doing nothing except gossiping but despite the queues would not help. On our second visit we were given a room which we found out had somebody already in it! On exchanging this for another we had the same thing yet again! So it took three attempts to get a room and we barely on the second occasion got a mumbled "I am sorry about it". No eye contact no explanation and each time took 5 mins to sort out and meant that we had to take our luggage upstair 3 times! The room itself was a good size as was the bed TV and shower/bath. But the bathroom was small (yet we had a closet 1.5 times its size!) and everything was old with ground in dirt. The sheets had something underneath which was very slippery which meant that you woke up in a different place to the sheets in the morning. I will not suggest this hotel to anybody unless you have no other choice.,dj_jay_smith
UR6583538,2007-12-January,This hotel was absolutely awful. I have been to NY many times before and have previously stated at the Marriott and Radisson and for a change thought I'd try Hotel Penn. What a big big mistake!! The reception/lobby looks nice but thats about it. You then realise all the unsavoury characters walking in and around. We booked a Penn 5000 Club room which are suppose to be the best rooms and offer seperate check in seperate lifts and so on. 1. Check in was very rude and seperate check in means if and when open and is a side room wth rude staff. 2. No seperate lifts for Penn 5000 - this is just dishonesty on their website 3. Upon getting to the room it was awful. Tatty towels and bathroom was disgusting no views and bedroom very dark and no good lighting. Very tired after a long flight yet could hear everything from room next door. After hard complaining given another room. 4. Second room equally as bad!! 5. Complimentary breakfast in the "exclusive lounge" was just a small dirty room and breakfast was a drinks machine and "continental" equated to some muffins 6. We decided to battle it out and checked out after 2 nights and stayed at the Radisson as we just couldnt cope as the hotel was so uncomfortable- not even good enough to take your shoes off! 7. Upon early check out presented with a bill that included $20 + tax per day for internet use when their internet site states it is free and we specifically phoned up from the UK beforehand to check on this to see whether PC provided in room or whether we needed to take our own laptop. Staff were very rude and accusatory and just completely unhelpful. For the sake of approx $40 you would think for good customer practice they would as a gesture of goodwill remove this charge. Very argumentative staff who havent got a clue about customer service. 8. I didnt authorise payment and told them to call when I got back to the UK yet they left me a message whilst I was still in NY and then charged my card!! I made the big mistake of taking into all the reviews on this site and wish I had. I travel a lot and have never in 10 years ever come across such a bad excuse for a hotel.,PlazaBoy
UR11503197,2007-12-December,Just spent 4 days in the greatest City in the world but staying at the Hotel Pennsylvania was the worst experience of my life. THE HOTEL IS CLOSING JANUARY 2 2008. Because of this they have not done any refurbishing decorating or even maintenance of the place in many years. The toilet leaked; the ceiling is peeling; there are no sprinklers; the tubs are ancient - all cracked and peeling; the bedspreads are disgustingly dirty and stained and no one cared about our complaints....just that it's closing. If it's not too late to change your reservations please do so. The prices are outrageous for this terrible place.,FortPierce_FLDaisy
UR8399051,2007-12-August,our fears were justified after reading reviews! I was prepared for the worst and got it a 4th floor hovel I couldn't believe that it passed health and safety checks. As I opened the door I saw an unmade bed dressing table covered in litter and make-up overflowing litter bin and carrier bags on floor. The air con was off wall and a shout from my husband told me he had found the bathroom! Disgusting does not give a true picture!! Blackened tiles and the toilet had excretement in it that looked like it had been there a week! We returned to the desk where I must admit the girl was very apologetic and gave us a room on the 13th floor which although very old was clean. Even though the location was excellent I would not stay there again.. and where are these renovated rooms???? Karen. Durham.England,kaz1978
UR7832558,2007-11-June,I'll start by saying that this hotel has an excellent location for getting about the city. The room was no worse than we had anticipated but could do with some redecoration. My main gripe with the hotel was the inadequacy of the sound proofing. A neighbouring room had for some reason a CD or radio playing the same song continuously all through the night every night. After ringing security the music stopped only to start again the following night. To top it off we got a wake-up call at 5.45am on our check-out morning which we hadn't requested. When I went down to reception to investigate the lady asked me if the room was under...and gave me my name without so much as querying who I actually was. I would normally expect to be asked "what name is the room under?" All in all we were happy enough if a little tired at the end of our trip!,jeremiahobediah
UR10735514,2007-10-November,In short: 1) Staff were miserable. 2) When first entering our room we passed the cleaner at the door who had kindly took a dump. 3) Wall paper hangin off walls. 4) Electricity sockets not working. 5) We had legs like second hand dart boards following the fleas efforts residing in the bed. 6) changed money at reception - got ripped off compared to local bank. Better cleaner and more pleasant accommodation availabe for less than this place. Be Wise!!,pinkjan
UR7586273,2007-10-May,I was attending a coference in another hotel which unfortunately was full and this booking was made for me by the event planners. I arrived to stay 2 nights Tues 8th and Wed 9th May to be told that I had been booked in for the Wed 9th and Thurs 10th. I assured the unfriendly receptionist the booking was for the nights I stated and gave her the booking form but she said she could give me a room for Tuesday night for $499 or come back tomorrow and stay the two nights the hotel had me booked in for. I was adamant their booking was incorrect. I then had to go and buy an internet access card to print off the rest of the paperwork. After standing in line again for another 30 mins I handed over the paperwork to be told the booking was for 8th & 9th May 2008. The booking was not going to be changed unless I paid another $150 per night to take it to $499 I had been offered if I wanted to stay. I asked for the manager and the girl disappeared with all the papers. She surfaced 10 mins later and said they would change it as it was their mistake. I was given a key for room 211 - this was the most disgusting room I have ever seen and went straight back down to be moved. The other room was better but still dirty and very tatty. I had to call security to get the window closed at it was stuck half open. On returning to my room on the second day I could not get in as the security latch was on from the inside. Once again I called security who showed up 40 minutes later and told me it was easy to break through the locks......very reassuring. It is the only hotel I have ever stayed at that I locked everything in my suitcase before going out. Another person I met had booked in there and been given the key to a room that had not been serviced. The second room he was given was the same and on seeing the third room left the hotel and went elsewhere. I understand for many people a hotel is just a base as they are out all day. Paying $350 per night the hotel should be more than a base and it should offer good security and be clean. The towels and floor mat all had holes in them and were grubby. The soundproofing was terrible and I could clearly hear the person next door in the bathroom.,mazziem
UR11467389,2007-10-December,First impressions of this hotel was the lobby is nice and busy  it looks nice enough.. Its a complete kip and nobody should have to stay there  hotels should not be this terrible. I stayed there for 10 days and I had to move room which was difficult to arrange. I eventually got to speak to the manager after standing in the queue for about 40 minuets about the flea marks on the sheets and the damp bed and they said they had no more rooms and basically tough luck. There was a lady booking in beside me and she asked me was there a problem with the rooms? I replied just ask can you have a look at the room before you complete your reservation  this lady asked to see the room and basically the managers response sums this hotel up no we do not show rooms  thats cause its the hotel of horrors,ronan21
UR6898968,2007-1-March,I stayed at the Hotel Pennsylvania from Feb. 21 through Feb. 27 2007. My employer booked the room and paid for it but I saw the invoice and saw he paid about $110 per night except on Fri and Sat nights when it jumped to about $180 per night. The location is good not great (the Hilton the Plaza the Waldorf - are in the Great Locations!) The place clean and tidy some fine cracks in the bathroom sink and toilet a very unremarkable room. The view was of little more than an airshaft. The housekeeping staff were friendly and delivered extra pillow soaps etc cheerfully. On the other hand the "exercize room" on the 18th floor was awful: unclean broken fitness machines - very shabby and neglected! There was almost no pretension of luxury or class. This place is but a step or two above a YMCA or a "super-budget" motel. The room was very small. The lobby which had some interesting murals of skyscrapers was busy like a train station from dawn until past midnight. Flight crews from Third World Nations airlines like to stay here. The bottom line: pay a little more and stay someplace nice. If you are really on a budget and can't find anything cheaper you know that at least this 90 year old hotel (scheduled to be demolished in 2 or 3 years I hear!) is well located clean and safe ... just don't have any expectations of charm luxury or loveliness. And don't eat in the crummy overpriced restaurants off the lobby on the ground floor!,buddmar
UR4597425,2006-9-March,We spent our holidays in this well-located NYC hotel (its main entrance is opposite Penn Station where you have access to almost all subway lines and it's placed only nine streets south from Times Square) from 3rd to 8th March. In the beginning we had to change of room because its lock system stopped working. It was the first night and we were waiting almost one hour to have our things back and get to other room (I had to call four times to the room service it was 11 pm). Our first room was very dirty in particular the bath with had old-guests "rests". The second room was cleaner but smaller. The staff hopefully changed our towels and cleaned and dried the bathroom. We had as many other guests some electrical problems in the sense we usually received some little electrical shocks with the knobs... I think the carpet floor and the bad electrical network configuration they had (some cables behind the fridge were opened-circuit) could be the problems. The air-conditionner didn't work properly so we were uncomfortable because the weather outside was very cold. In our opinion this hotel is OK it's very well situated and very affordable. I recommend this hotel for budget travelers who only stay in the hotel for sleeping.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR6352893,2006-9-December,It is now 11 months since my stay here but the not very pleasant memories of this place are still fresh. It was my first visit to the USA and was on a two night stopover to see the sights of New York before moving on to a business trip. The hotel was booked by my colleague and when I looked at the hotel website before the trip I thought wow what a great looking hotel for the money. On arriving tired after our flight and walking into the impressive lobby I was still thinking this is great. Up to the 6th floor in the fast lift-still impressed- then out into the corridor-OK not quite as nice but still pretty good strange looking prison cell like doors. Then when I entered my room I realised why it was so cheap. Everything was shabby the carpet was bare and sticky the bathroom was dirty and rusty all in all very dingy. I put my case down and at that moment a mouse scuttled out from under the radiator to see who had disturbed it and then scuttled back again. Just what you want to see in your hotel room! When I complained about it to reception the guy just laughed. I asked to be moved but there were no rooms available. It was just somewhere to rest my head and put up with it as this was secondary to my excitement of being in New York for the first time and seeing all the sights. We had one full day in New York and made the most of it. On the plus side the guy at the hotel tourist desk was very helpful and we booked our open topped bus tour through him. It was fantastic to see all the famous sights and is an experience I will never forget. The only downside is the hotel. The location as everybody says is perfect and the double bed was actually quiet comfortable and clean. Would I recommend it? Definitley not- unless you are fond of mice!!!,Tetleydrinker
UR4953669,2006-9-April,For the price I expected a small basic room. It was disgusting. There was wallpaper peeling from the wall cracks in all the tiles in the bathroom a hairdryer next to the sink (i.e over it) and wires hanging out under the desk. Behind the aircon unit there was loads of broken parts of the wall at the back as though it had crumbled off. The carpet was not vacuumed for our entire stay. The bed sheets were not changed every day. The state of the floor under the bed - was simply repulsive. I also (my fault entirely) left some goods in the very well disguised wardrobe. Worth about $200. The hotel claim not to have found it in there when I am 200% sure I left in there. I think we all know where that has gone....don't trust the cleaners take any valuable goods with you during the day. Appalling. Its a perfect location and a lovely building. What a waste.,Hannahd
UR5041941,2006-8-May,We booked the hotel through a teletext travel agent which was possibly the wrong thing to do to begin with however this is a terrible hotel. Bad service dreadful standard of room. We were given the key to our room which was awful. We complained and were given the key to another room which was equally bad. Couldn't stay in this hotel. Went to the nearest internet cafe and found another hotel. (which was infact wonderful),EllieA
UR4594353,2006-8-March,After being checked in by a very dour female I was sent up to the 5th floor. Whilst the lobby and main corridors looked fine the corridor towards my room was dark and looked dirty. The door to the room itself was marked as though it had been forced at some point - which made me feel really insecure (especially as a single female). Inside the room I was greeted by peeling paint on the ceiling and walls and huge patches of damp on one wall. The walls had shadows where pictures and items of furniture had been moved. However the bed had clean sheets and was reasonably comfortable. The shower-room (no bath)was small with ingrained dirt between the tiles. The shower tray was cracked and the showertaps were impossible to control - so I was doused in scalding hot water followed by freezing cold water. I would never stay here again - ever!,Yblodyntatws
UR5577335,2006-8-August,Oh my word. This hotel is so so bad you simply must stay in it. The bed broke. The sink broke. The bath was broken. The bathroom lock was broken. There was mud yes mud dripping from the windows. We wrote our names in it. The hotel is so cavernous and abandoned you'd swear it was haunted. The travel agents called it the 'Roach Motel'. Need I say more? Yes. We had to queue QUEUE in a line of people to complain. The maid walked in twice. The iron was dangerously wired. The view was of a brick wall. The location was difficult to get to. There was blood crashing in giant waves from the elevators. That's not true but we half expected Johnny to come a knowcking with his axe. Avoid,chrislea100
UR6082039,2006-7-November,Hi my name is Alan and i stayed with Gillian at the Hotel . I endorse all she said but will add a few things . The web site photo of the room did not correspond to the ghastly reality . I am in the Irish Armed forces so i am not hard to please but you get what you pay for so i did expect more for my dollars . Black boot mark skid s straight off some parade ground adorned the faded cream walls  maybe some frustrated recruit was let loose in the room i mused ... how and ever when i complained i was sent to a hotel customer phone were this manager came on to speak . When i gave him our complaint he said he'd pass me on to the head of house keeping ...and promptly hung up as the dial tone engaged so i could wait to speak to this individual ... i hung up and rang the manager back and he told me to go to reception and give my complaint in there ... i tried but the line up was huge and i had jet lag at this stage and was in no mood to que for half an hour again .. so i rang him back and asked him " do you do anything face to face in New York ? I want to speak to you directly !" with this he came over all apoligectic and offered me a different upgrade room with a kingsize bed etc etc .. i called round to see him just five seconds walk from the phone ( so why couldnt he have done this earlier ?) i collected my new keys and the new room was great and was what i had expected in the first place .... stay at this hotel if you dont mind indifferent bad mannered staff who seem like disinterested factory workers putting cogs on long convoyer belts and if you have a pet spider .. Great location though beside Penn station etc,iompaighhart
UR4331017,2006-7-January,Checked in to hotel all looked well until we got out of lift.The room was so dirty we would not let our son out of his buggy after 5 mins & few photos we checked outtold guy at reception the place was a dump he did not even argue with us & gave us our money back (must be used to it).This place should be a museum for the homeless so we can see how they lived before they moved on to the streets as the streets of NY are without a doubt a safer & cleaner place to stay.DO NOT stay in this place my wife cried when she saw the room.I know it was not expensive but this dump lacked the basics (safe & clean).Better off to bring a bin bag to NY & sleep in it.DO NOT STAY HERE.If you decide to stay here visit your GP beforehand for the relevant injections YOU WILL NEED THEM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Please do not let this put you off NY what a great city.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR4443022,2006-7-February,The Hotel Pennyslvania is a very touch-and-go hotel. its either a clean room with shiny renovated bathroom or drab and mouldy room with awful stench. Well luckily we got a clean and shiny room although we caught sight of the ghastly others when we passed newcomers to the hotel only to hear them gasp in shock. With luck you will have a nice room like we did. heres hoping.,villageoaf2000
UR6344043,2006-7-December,This has to be one of the worst hotels I have ever experienced. I stayed there for 3 nights from 30th Nov till 3 Dec with my mum and I can tell you I will never set foot there again. The lobby (reception) is reminiscent of a train station  it's too busy and the queues are massive to check in/check out. Our room was on the 14th floor the wall paper was peeling off our pillows were as flat as a pancake (No spares). The bathroom was disgusting our toilet was leaking from the pipe so a puddle of water was forming on the side of the bathroom. The bath tub was also peeling and we only got very lukewarm water to wash in which was not easy to get. To top it all off I used the bedroom phone to make a 3 mins international call (bearing in mind that there were no call prices available) when I checked out my bill mounted to$60!!!!!!! What a shocker to the system. I think it's a tragic hotel and I can think of better places to go such as the Ramada New Yorker down the road.,Toams
UR5572974,2006-7-August,We went to New York to see the New Year in. It was my partners first time and my second. We were really excited about going and no it wasn't cheap. When we got to the hotel we were like other people have stated very impressed with the lobby. There was a police passing out parade going on at the time and all the New York police were in the lobby so this gave it a great atmosphere. When we got to our room I wasn't impressed it looked grimy and the bathroom looked like it could do with a good clean. The carpet looked like it hadn't been hoovered and when I looked under the bed I found a pair of boxer shorts. I called the front desk and told them and also said we would like to move to another room and was told all the rooms were taken and we had to stay there. The maid who was very cheerful and nice came and picked up the boxers shorts and said sorry. We used the hotel as a base and spent all our time out walking around and visiting sites. I didn't like going back there in the evening as I previously said it looked very grimy. We were there for 6 nights and just had to grit and bear it. I wouldn't book this hotel again as the hotel I stayed in previously when I went to New York was the same rating but much much cleaner.,landykizzy
UR5922283,2006-6-October,Having read the reviews prior to my partner and i travelling out for a split break (2 nights penns 4 nights vegas 2 nights penns) we were a little apprehensive about staying at the said hotel. On arrival we were able to check in at least two hours early which was good the hotel lobby is impressive in a dated sort of way. Our room on the 17th floor although large was in dire need of redecoration the carpet was rucked and worn and the tiles in the bathroom had blown from the wall. However the bed was clean large and comfortable so we made do in the hope that our return trip might find us placed in a better room. No such luck! room was half the size much smaller bed barely a double and decoration just as shabby. We didnt complain simply because we didnt intend to spend much time in our room but would reccomend any one reading this review to either ask for a redecorated room or pay for an upgrade. Would i stay again? Yes because location is unbeatable but would want updated room.,nadinekettering
UR6079019,2006-6-November,October 20 2006: Paid $275 for room 513A with 2 beds . No view. Very dim light bulbs. Bathroom filled with mildew. Only one set of towels for 2 persons. Concierge did not know of any Korean restaurants which were one block away in Koreatown. Would not recommend this hotel at all. Covenient location in front of Madison Square Garden and Penn Staation.,Magoobaby
UR4327872,2006-6-January,Happy New Year Everyone Just returned from a 7 day trip. Our taxi from JFK accidentally took us to the hotel Peninsula. When we got to our hotel we wish we had got out at the Peninsula. Firstly the Building itself is very impressive and as many have said the lobby is beautiful. On exiting the lift a strange musty smell hits you but thats easy to live with. We werent impressed with the room what so ever. We were up for asking for another room but decided to wait till morning. We had a good night sleep and the maids cleaned the room and got new towels. We decided we would stick with it. As i say the hotel is perfect for anyone on a budget. In other words if you have come to New York for the sights and not the hotel its acceptable.,BIGSAMENGLAND
UR4583765,2006-5-March,This is a very dirty shabby hotel. We were offered 3 rooms none of which were clean. The bathrooms all had mouldy tiles and peeling baths. We expected basic but not dirty. A very disappointing start to our holiday.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR5300784,2006-5-June,Arriving at the hotel the reception seemed ok but we had to wait nearly 2 hours to get the room the staff was very unfriendly. When we got in the room i could not believe my eyes the wall paper fell of was humid and dirty it was digusting. We aske for an another room an that one was a little bit better but still dirty filzy just awful. The hotel needs to be urgently renovated an the direction is not working either. I never met such a rude personal like in that hotel. Never again to this hotel an if it would be the only one in new york Just stay away there,beggen
UR5428767,2006-5-July,My husband and I went in with expecting the worst. But the rate was great for the holiday season; $150 a night. Yes it was dirty old and the clientele was sketchy. The hallways had a smell of ode de pot.. yeah we could of got a second hand high... The fixtures in the bathroom were something outta 1962 Lindy's in the lobby... eek... bad news there. We laughed about it.. knowing we were paying $150 on a holiday weekend and that is unheard of in NYC.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR5034095,2006-4-May,Stayed here for 5 nights during april. You could not ask for a better location in Manhattan subways nearby the MSG Times Square and the Empire state building 5 minutes away. It was a 2 star hotel & it lived up to that rating. poor service on check-in (very slow) the lobby looks great but wait until you see some of the floors. stayed on the 15th floor & you would not believe it wallpaper in the corridors looked like it had been touched by freddy crugers claw the doors looked like they had been borrowed from a padded cell in mental home. I dont think many of the floors are renovated & i think the best are reserved for the penn 5000 guests which costs a lot more. The room was basic with very old fashioned furnishings the veiw well there was no veiw just other rooms across the way and there will be many roooms with the same. A few positive things though the room was very clean beds bathroom and furniture. We had cable tv messaging & gerenal services and house keeping every morning. If you are on a budget holiday stay at the hotel penn there is a bar & restaurant & basic gym to use so to wrap things up it is ideal if you're not planning to be in the hotel that often You get what you pay for!...,A TripAdvisor Member
UR4932858,2006-4-April,Location is good price is good but..............YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR! Lobby is beautiful everything above that needs an overhaul. It ws 25 degrees the heater didn't work. The refrigerator looked a hundred years old the electrical outlets were falling out of the wall bathroom was dirty....this was a renovated room. I hate to think what a no renovated room is like. We won't go back.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR6030894,2006-31-October,Stayed here October 2006 very disapointed with the hotel as soon as we got of the lift i new what was coming.Needs a big clean up.,wilfed
UR4824161,2006-31-March,Nice room on 12th floor. A bit uncomfortable as temps were unseasonably warm no a/c available until April 15 couldn't figure out how to open window for fresh air. Very comfortable bed. Good shower. Great location. Friendly staff. Dropped off keys rather than full check-out (long line at counter). Credit card bill seemed high so I called and was told that I was charged for two days parking at $37.50 per day which is rather unbelievable since I arrived and left in taxi and never had a car. Several more phone calls e-mails and waiting for resolution. Non-apologetic attitude from hotel.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR4400383,2006-31-January,If the city's hotels were not already filled I would never have stayed here. The lobby is elegant and deceiving because the rooms are Terrible. We had to look at 3 different rooms before we could find one barely tolerable. It was extremely small outdated and smelled of urine. (And to think it was the best of the 3 we looked at.) Sure it is fun to stay in Manhattan but this dump is not worth it. I would stay in Jersey or Queens or Brooklyn if you cannot find a different hotel in Manhattan.,Kat8545
UR6525945,2006-31-December,I was really disappointed by this hotel. Very well located but that's all. hall of reception not badly but the room superior is very disappointing for 150$: dirty old A advice avoid absolutely!! Look at the photos better than words.,friniace
UR6030849,2006-30-October,We arrived in New York after having spent the best part of a day travelling. All we wanted to do was to relax and clean ourselves up before hitting the streets. No such luck. Our room was disgusting it smelt musty-as though we were breathing in somebody else's stale air. This we could have coped with if we could have opened the windows fully. The bathroom was horrible- there were black hairs in the sink and the bath. After two unanswered pleas to housekeeping for a cleaner finally a little man turned up. He had no idea what we were asking him to do and merely flushed the toilet and turned the hoover on and off. I am not exaggerating! The black hairs were still there! We felt so dissapointed having spent hours on trip advisor chosing our hotel. The last thing we wanted to do was to have to gather up all of our things and drag our weary bodies down to reception to ask for another room as we aren't normally complainers but it had to be done. We were given another room (the reception staff didn't seem at all suprised by our request) and it was much nicer in retrospect it was obvious that our first room hadn't been cleaned at all. Choose this hotel wisely. Its not all bad the location is amazing and the diner at the front of the hotel is good but don't expect any good views or for that matter any good service from the staff.,SamReynolds
UR5529713,2006-30-July,We stayed there 3 years ago and vowed never to return. First of all unless you use Penn. Station the location is not that hot. And quite qrim and dirty. We lived in NYC for35 years and returned for a visit after an absence of about 10. Try finding a decent deli in the location. The room was very large but the whole atmosphere had sort of a down at the heels Willy Lohman look and feel. The three cockroaches were the largest we have ever seen and we now live in Hawaii where there are many but not like those! For 50 years we have stayed in second and third class hotels in Europe and Asia but never anything like this.,Jordy
UR4397915,2006-30-January,We stayed at the Penn for 4 nights at the end of a 2 week holiday in the states and it was the worst of the four hotels we stayed in. But it wasn't awful. We chose it as a couple of our friends had stayed there and siad it was ok. It was also amongst the cheapest hotels in midtown. We checked in after 1am and were shown to our room by a very enthusiastic bell boy. Unfortunately the room was horrible. With it being so late we decided to wait until the morning to change. The room smelt awful was very small and poorly laid out (the tv stand was at the side of the bed) and the walls were dirty and in a poor state of repair. We went to the desk in the morning where we learnt that it was in fact a smoking room. THis angered me because I had gone to the trouble of e-mailing the hotel with my name and booking reference to ask for a non-smoking room only to be told that most rooms were non-smoking and you wouldn't be given a smoking room unless you asked. It was a slap in the face therefore to be tols by the clerk that I should have specified non-smoking on our arrival. Our next room was much better though not great. It was larger and cleaner and did not smell. THe bathroom was much better as well. On our third night our neighbour decided to play loud music after 11pm. We called reception and the music was turned off promptly. At 1.45am the music returned. Once again we called and the music was turned off. UNfortunately there was an additional noise which drove us mad. We never did discover what it was but it sounded like a pneumatic drill going for 2 seconds every 9 seconds from somewhere outside which had been going since we returned to our room. THe repetitiveness of it was maddening and it was impossible to sleep. At 3:30 we gave up and went down to reception who could only suggest changing rooms. We tried another room but the noise coul dbe heard there as well so back downstairs we went. The next room was quiet but was a smoking room again so we went down again at our wit's end. FOrtunately the next room was both quieter and free from odour and we managed to get to sleep around 4.30am. I must point out that the lady on the desk was very helpful and did not seem to mind us continually returning to her. We do not know if the noise was within the control of the hotel or not but it was gone by the morning and did not return on our fourth night. THe best thing about the hotel is its location and its relative cost. It was the most expensive hotel we stayed at and yet the worst. I guess that's NYC for you. It is very handy for Penn Station and there are plenty of shops within walking distance if you are so inclined. Had we been given our eventual rooms intitially and not had noise problems I would have been happier but I'm afraid I would look elsewhere next time.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR5021793,2006-30-April,My mom and I stayed at the Hotel Penn for 9 days and in all honesty the hotel was the worst part. The staff unfriendly barely accomodating and the rooms HORRIBLE! We unfortunately had to check into the hotel at around 11pm because of our flight and the first room we received (1161) was disgusting. It was not big enough for two people it would have barely sufficed for one. The room was not vaccumed we found an earring on the floor and hair all over the sink. So we requested a new room. The attendant tried to get us to stay in that room but there was no way we were going to. We then got moved to another room (1119) which was much better. Clean and enough room for two people. Even though we had to share a bed. For the rest of the trip we did have a problem with the room rate but on the last day they caved and fixed it. As for the room attendants leaving enough towels and supplies we constantly had to call to get them apparently leaving two towels and face cloths for two people is difficult. I don't recommend this hotel to anyone stay at a Super 8 it will be much better. Also that whole cliche about New Yorkers being rude only applies for this hotel staff everyone else in that city is awesome.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR5765727,2006-3-September,We stayed at this hotel from 11-14th July. On the 13th of July there was a fire on the 11th floor around 1.30pm. We were woken by hotel staff to evacuate the floor which was quite frightening. The smoke was so thick you could hardly see. There was no fire alarm no evacuation signal and no sprinklers on the 11th floor. When I questioned the firemen in attendance about this they told me to take it up with management. The location may be very good but my advice is DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL.,TheSimpsonsat36
UR6051685,2006-3-November,We checked into this hotel by queuing in a foyer which ressembled a busy bus station when we got to the counter we were 'greeted' by a rude disinterested woman who obviously liked to spend her day looking at her fake nails and applying extra make up. She actually scowled as a matter of course and didnt feel the need to answer a question when put directly to her - we were being nice! As we walked to our room through a very long series of dark corridors reality began to sink in as to the quality of our surroundings the carpet was faded either grey or green and the walls were much similar there was a distinctly dusty musty smell so I wasnt looking forward to seeing the bedroom. But we had to wait to see that as the maid was still working away and just 5 minutes did it. Our bedroom was small and the decor was not just old but very old and musky. The bedside lamp had a very obvious layer of dust even a few cobwebs. The bathroom had cracked tiles and the shower floor tiles were also cracked and stained a nasty yellow colour. We did complain and insisted on seeing the manager who offered us a decent room in the business accomodation of the hotel. I have been in cleaner $2 hostels in Thailand,Gillian3
UR5031539,2006-3-May,I was just in New York for a 2 day interview so I wanted to stay someplace inexpensive yet not too far away from the office I had to go to (near Grand Central). My mother and I looked online and saw that Hotel Pennsylvania had a reasonable rate and was in a good location. I arrived at the hotel late Monday night and stepped out of the cab into a rather motley mix of people some not so appealing looking. But I chalked that up to the area probably being a hangout for teenagers and whatnot. I walked into the lobby and it was the same thing. I wasn't worried however. Sure there were more random people walking around the hotel than I was used to but it was near a station after all. Most hotels would ask non-patrons and loiterers to leave... but I shrugged it off. In the midst of my check in a man came up to the front desk yelling about some problem that was supposed to have been resolved already. He had an unfamiliar accent so I couldn't make out just what the issue was. I did notice however that the front desk girl conducted herself rather unprofessionally. But I figured it was late so she was probably tired and frustrated by now. I wrote it off. I headed for the elevators where I had to show my room key before I could even enter the elevator area. This was the point where I actually first braced myself. While this sounds like a comforting security measure I've been to hundreds of hotels all around the world and have never seen such a practice. I found myself a little wary wondering why they would need such a precaution. Maybe the area wasn't as safe as Time Square where I usually stay. When I stepped off the elevator and onto the 4th floor I knew with a sinking feeling that my time there would not be pleasant. I was hit with a rush of stale cigarette smoke. Apparently my non-smoking room was on a smoking floor which rather negated its efficacy. The hall carpet looked as though its original color was buried underneath quite a few layers of dirt and grime. Stains large and small were everywhere. I was a little frightened of seeing so many stains considering that the lighting was inordinately dim and further hampered by a mist of smoke. If that's what I could see how much was I missing? Many of the directional signs to the rooms where hand drawn as quite a few of the signs had fallen off probably long ago. What was even more fun for me there were no signs to my room at all. I had to roam the dark dank hallway aimlessly. Fortunately I found it just before I was about to go downstairs to complain. Many of the doors to the rooms were covered with some sort of green plastic decoration. It's hard to describe but they were obviously old and tattered. Quite a few of the doors were missing them and the ones that were still hanging often had holes. I arrived in my room only to find that my carpet was filthier than the carpet in the hallways. So filthy was it that I never took off my shoes. There was a double bed with an obviously worn bedspread an armchair about 30 years old that looked as though it had never been cleaned in all that time and a desk that looked only a few years old but that had a chair whose cushion was already covered in stains. As I walked in I immediately smelled the musky odor of mold and soon I found ONE of its sources. There was a little mini-fridge of the floor with black mold visible on the outside of it. I was horrified. I timidly entered the bathroom hoping for a bright spot but afraid of something worse. The towels and washclothes were folded on what looked like the type of bathroom shelving you'd find in a high school locker room. The problem was that the holes that were part of the shelving design probably meant to prevent water buildup were full of rust and dirt. Apparently noone at this hotel had ever heard of LYSOL (fortunately I had and came armed with a bottle). I read one review where someone walked into a room there and it reeked of bleach they were appalled. Me I only wish I'd had the smell of bleach in my room. I gingerly pulled back the shower curtain to spray the area with Lysol only to find that no amount of Lysol would convince me to bathe myself in such a place. There was no plug for the drain so I could clearly see the corroded rusted and dirt encrusted area around and inside it. The enamel on the tub was cracked and peeling in many places creating partially opened crevices where it was impossible to clean. Maybe if the whole thing had been soaked in pure bleach..... From what I saw either the tub wasn't cleaned after the last guest (or few guests) or whoever cleaned it didn't know how to do their job. To be fair maybe they were just as grossed out as I was a preferred to avoid it. All I wanted to do was survive till morning when I could find other accommodations. I went to the window to close the curtains (my room looked into another room) and I happened to glance down at the ancient fan/heater attached to the wall. To my horror and nausea even now the vent was filled with mold grime dirt and only the Lord knows what else. It was black with layer upon layer of filth. Absolutely disgusting and I'm sure a health hazard and code violation of some sort. It's just as well the window was stuck and didn't close because I felt I would rather freeze all night than even let my pinky touch the dial on that contraption. And I did. I spent a restless night hearing people come down the fire escape through my hopelessly ajar window. I'll try to cut this longwinded story short on only mention in passing things like the stains on the inside of the bedspread the filthy ironing board the lack of a bolt lock on the door and the fleas. Needless to say I hightailed it out of there early in the morning. I checked out a couple of housekeeping carts on my way out and noticed that there were no cleaning products whatsoever. There were only refills of toilet paper and changes of linen. Actually this place was such that you had to put a sign on your door saying that you wanted them to clean the room to get service at all. They have a $50 early check out fee that got waived for me which is just as well for them as I was appalled enough to make my complaints known which is something I'm usually loathe to do. I ended up staying at the Comfort Inn on 46th St. which turned out to be $10 cheaper a night almost on the corner of Times Square closer to my interview and CLEAN. Granted I had just left hell so anything else felt like heaven. I know others have mentioned that their in the midst of renovating and that some of the rooms are ok. But as for me I wouldn't take the risk. Friends don't let friends stay at the Hotel Pennsylvania.,brazenxvirtue
UR6026840,2006-29-October,my wife booked a trip to new york for my 40th birthday.Ive always wanted to go and visit the place since being a kid.New york was everything i hoped it would be and moreapart from one thingthe hotel.im not fussy when it comes to accommodation but the place was terrible.Dirtyscruffyare the first two words that come to mind.When we arrived we went into the room and found the bath half fulland one of the windows stuck open.Remember this was in january in new york.we asked to be moved and settled for the room we were given.I stay in a bed and breakfast place in the uk a couple of times a year to watch drag racing at santa pod in northamptonshire.We pay 20 per night for that and its better than the pennsylvaniaand no im not exaggerating.,tonyshep
UR6305707,2006-29-November,We were booked into Hotel Pennsylvania on the 11th. Nov..2006. It was our first time to New York. What a Nightmare. I would just like to say we found this Hotel filthy dirty smelly bedrooms broken bathroom fittings holes in wallsdirty stinking pillows mice and cockroaches public toilets with slime on walls urine scale on toilets. And last but by no means least dead flies in our drinks. This place had absoutly no hygene standards anywhere. It is a walking timebomb for all kinds of diseases brought about by unhygenic practises. They have the nerve to charge for five nights 1250$ = approx.(994 euros),Bidone
UR5526436,2006-29-July,After looking forward to the trip of a lifetime and my first trip abroad with my friend to say my experience was spoiled is an understatement. The hotel lobby on the whole looks very nice but the rooms were an absolute disgrace and I have never seen such filth. We settled under duress for the third room we were allocated simply because we were too tired to argue any further. All three rooms were extremely dirty and unfit to stay in with rat poison laid out for all to see. Pipes were open so were an invite to the rats of New York to enter at any time. The bathroom was a disgrace with rusty fittings and grime everywhere. The wallpaper even had graffitti written all over it. A mouse was even seen in Lindy's restaurant which is situated within the hotel complex. To top it all the hotel staff were most unfriendly very very rude by New York standards and all had a couldn't care less attitude. This hotel stay spoiled my whole experience and my friend and I shall definately not being visiting New York again.,katieklux

UR5406073,2006-28-June,My family of three stayed here last year in July but the picture of the hotel is still clear in my mind! My advice to ANYONE is not to book things through Expedia. When we arrived at our local airport we found out that our flight to NYC had been cancelled. The airline (Delta) was very unhelpful since we had booked through Expedia and gave us no other options for different flights going to NYC throughout the day. We went over to the JetBlue desk and the happened to have three seats left that they gave us for cheaper than we paid for Delta. The flight was boarding in ten minutes and the crew made sure that the plane waited until we got on to take off. The flight crew was extremely pleasent to be around and offered my son extra snacks for the much to short plane ride. We had arranged for a shuttle to pick us up through Expedia and when we got off the plane we had to wait an hour and a half for the people to call the shuttle because the "maximum amount of people" were not all present. Words to the wise just take a cab. Most cabs have the flat rate of $50.00 to take you from the airport to wherever you are going in the city once again cheaper than what we paid for the shuttle. I had read what other reviers wrote before we stayed at hotel Penn but there was no way that we could cancel on Expedia because we didn't purchase the cancellation policy. We arrived at Hotel Penn a little earlier than check in time and they gave us a room right away. The hallways were old and not very well lit while the elevators had TV's in them and you couldn't get on them from the lobby unless you showed the man your room key. We got into the room and we were hit with a burst of old moldy air. I walked in and didn't even bother to put our luggage in the room. I got on the phone to call the front desk to see if they had any other rooms available. The front desk MUST know what you are doing because after TEN minutes of waiting for them to pick up my husband had the idea to just push zero. Tried that and they picked up right away. I asked very politly if they had any other rooms and they said no even though I was pretty sure they had something else. I had my husband get on the phone and after 30 minutes of back and forth they agreed to take us to another room. A bellhop came almost immediatly and brought us to five other rooms before we found one that wouldn't kill us if we breathed the air. We somehow got upgraded to a suite that must have been reserved for extremely rich people who decide to stay there for no extra charge. There were two double beds with a large old desk and some light. The bathroom was filled with mold and not cleaned but the water was ok for taking showers. The room was still moldy and dusty as all the others were but at least it was spacious. My son tried to open the window (we were facing a building so no view) and the blinds came tumbling down on top of him. The air worked but you had to give it some time. We ate at the little resteraunt downstairs and that was OK nothing fancy just a little burger joint. It was a few minutes away from Time Square and was right across the street from Penn Station Macys Old Navy Madison Square Gardens and the Empire state building. There is also a subway station right underneath the hotel! I would definitly stay there again if they managed to clean up the rooms tremendously and maybe changed the towels once in a while. It was a GREAT location however I don't see us staying there again this summer! We honestly did not stay in the hotel that much except for sleeping because you're in NYC the center of it all so why spend time in a hotel?,Kelsey1023
UR6508705,2006-28-December,This place once you get past the huge lobby is so like the hotel in The Shining that it's uncanny. You really do expect an axe murderer to break your door down. Thankfully the doors are made of metal which is most reassuring. The whole place is in dire need of a refurbish and the staff a change of uniform. Having said all that it is not too bad for location or price. The room had some well dodgy stains on the carpet but the linen was clean. The bathroom was tiny with a door frame that was clearly rotting. Not sure how clean you can get in this place. A place that is bearable for a short stay.,Xeres25
UR5883843,2006-27-September,The company I work for contracted with tthe Hotel Pennsylvania for rooms. I heard that the hotel was not very nice but did not stay there until September. I stayed 3 different times for one night each. I had been warned by other co-workers that there were bedbugs but thought it was probably just "drama". On my second stay (10th floor) within 24 hours the bites showed up all over my arms shoulders and neck. It is now a week later and the itching is UNBELIEVABLE... My advice is Stay Away from this hotel no matter what the price!,LATEEDAH
UR6182179,2006-27-November,oohh we checked in and we checked out in the space of 4 hours. the 2 rooms we were allocated one stank of cigarettes the other of mould. the linens were nasty esp the towels in the bathroom. the beds looked like 100 souls had slept in them. the fridge i espcially called and asked for to store medication was a relic from the 70s and was not switched on. when plugged in i realised why as the humming was in direct competion with the window airconditioning unit. it was depressing. very depressing. the whole place needs an uplift. i wouldnt have minded if it was a 2 nights stay but we were booked in for a week. and it was expensive some nights $250. we moved to "the Time" check it out its lovely. this place is for back packers who can afford $250 a night (?!) and dont want to wash - nasty towels and yellow bath tub. Horrid dont go.,sdciqbal
UR5223726,2006-27-May,I just returned from a 3 night stay at Hotel Penn and I would not recommend it to my worst enemy! Its deceiving because when you see the lobby you think it wont be so bad but once you see the rooms its a different story. Our first room was on the 6th floor was disgustingly dirty and had gum stuck to the walls near the window. The carpets are old and dirty there was no air conditioning and the room was very small. We then asked for a cleaner room and had to pay extra for it which I didnt have a problem with so they moved us to the 12th floor Corporate Penn suites. Not much better than the 6th floor but at least it was a little bit bigger. This hotel needs to be torn down and totally renovated. The only good thing about it was the location but even so I would rather stay in a hotel not so centrally located as long as it was clean. I will never return to this hotel thats for sure!,A TripAdvisor Member
UR5013000,2006-27-April,I stayed in the Hotel Pennsylvania for 4 nights in April as part of a group of 6. We had booked two triple rooms and on check in were given one room on the fifth floor and another on the fourteenth floor. The fifth floor room (No. 537) was basic and tiny. It had two double beds so was not suitable for three people sharing. The decor was old and tired although kept clean and the room smelled of fried food from the various food outlets nearby. The second room on the fourteenth floor (No. 1452) was much better in comparison. It was made up of two bedrooms with two single beds in each so one person allocated to the fifth floor room moved up. The room was spacious and clean and although sparsely furnished was in ok condition. The bathrooms are slightly old fashioned but clean and the shower is hot and powerful. Overall we were pleasantly surprised with the experience having read the reviews before arriving. It's true that the corridors and general public areas of the hotel are dingy and could do with a good clean but obviously the hotel has found that the location guarantees permanent bookings and so are content to skimp on renovations. If you are on a first time visit to New York it is in a perfect location. There are plenty of shops nearby it's across the street from Macy's and a few blocks from Times Square and the Empire State Building. However there are no restaurants or bars nearby and if you're looking for interesting food you have to travel. Also because you're on a main throughfare there is constant noise and traffic 24/7. I wouldn't choose this hotel again simply because I would prefer to stay in a more local area but if you're looking for cheap central accommodation this is fine. Just make sure that you're not expecting too much and ask for a room above the 13th floor.,Sark
UR5513143,2006-26-July,Where do I begin? Stayed from July 9th to July 17th and the best bit about the holiday was coming home. On the Wednesday night the 11th floor went on fire the block was evacuated but not the rooms! On the Thursday morning we smelled smoke but thought no more of it. AFTER we checked out another resident told us about the fire and the 11th floor was damaged...we were on the 12th. We complained and received $193.64......I emailed the manager on the 18th July from Ireland and haven't received a reply as to why we werent woken up.... Room was dingy but good cleaning service. If I could go back I would stay elsewhere...good location but they have a downright rude hotel reception staff! Those staff on the information desk where you buy tickets for broadway and tours etc. were very nice and helpful though!,Katherine00
UR4389027,2006-26-January,Having read hundreds of reviews on Hotel Pennsylvania my boyfriend and I still decided to stay here for five nights in December last year as we were travelling on a budget. Simply because as so many others already have mentioned the price and the location is unbeatable! We were given a room in the 14th floor and we laughed our heads off all the way to the room: Everything was EXACTLY as we had imagined! The hallway was creepy and became darker the further in we went. The carpets were dirty and the wallpaper was coming off the wall several places. Hotel Pennsylvania was quickly renamed Hotel Trannsylvania by which it is still referred to. However the room was actually better than we had feared. The bathroom was clean (although water was constantly dripping into the bathtub) and we were given fresh towels and sheets every day. The heater/AC worked fine but made a lot of noise! So much that we because the windows were badly isolated and it was sooo cold! decided to get drunk so that we would get some sleep while the heater was on. (a good old Norwegian trick) Oh well. My main concern which I wanted to write about because I haven't seen anyone commenting this is how badly suited this hotel is for asthmatics and those who are allergic. There are carpets on all the floors both in the rooms and in the hallways and they are rarely - if ever - vacuumed. I had an allergic reaction almost immediately after entering the room; luckily I had brought antihistamins and I continued taking these every day of my stay in this hotel which definitely saved our holiday. I also used a lot more asthma medicine while staying here although this probably also was caused by the cold weather. At last I have included a very funny picture from our room in Trannsylvania. It is of a HUGE orange .. err thing that was placed on the top of the closet. It had no function whatsoever it was just a very ugly ball-shaped sort of decoration that collected a lot of dust. I hope it will give you as many laughs as it has given us! (PS: During our one-week-stay in NY we spent five nights in this hotel to save money - and then spent the last two nights in a reeeeally nice hotel just because "we're worth it"! This was definitely a good solution - which I can recommend.) Have a great trip!,A TripAdvisor Member
UR5010643,2006-26-April,Great location poor hotel The room was dirty the customer service was poor both before and during the stay i would not recommend this hotel for anyone . it relies on its brand and history rather than its actions,A TripAdvisor Member
UR6174398,2006-25-November,Not as bad as some reviews said. It is very slow to check instaff kept walking off from behind the desk even though people are waitinga bit rude! Stayed on 2nd floor room needs updating- new plaster and a fresh paint job to start with bath was rusty with some enamel missing. My room had 2 adjoining doors that leads to rooms next door. You could hear everything not good as the ladies next door always got up at 6. Also had a dog staying on our corridor very annoying. Sheets and towels were clean and changed every day. Power very low in rooms takes ages to dry hair.No heatingbring a sweater to wear at night.,bluepc
UR5709823,2006-25-August,This was a rare trip to New York given the price of the hotel I expected great things. Being a city centre hotel (good location then!) the lobby was busy - but the staff were completely disinterested in the customers - there was no organisation - so the whole check in process was a battle and quite stressful. You really had to fight to get attended to cos all the other people were determined to get to the front first! But the most memorable moment which really is burned into my memory was when my girlfriend and I opened the door to our room. The smell the stained walls the fridge that looked like it had belonged to a homeless person (filthy battered rusty empty and incidentally not working) no t.v. filthy carpets and windows that wouldnt open even a little - all added up to a very strong impression. We were stunned in an attempt to alleviate the feeling (bear in mind 9 hours travelling led to this) I suggested that perhaps they were expecting us to pay by the hour - but I think my girlfriend thought I meant she looked like a hooker - so it didnt really help! Really if we had walked into the hotel and been greeted by a receptionist sitting in his stained vest behind a mesh screen (not that I have ever been to a rent by the hour hotel of course) and then been led to this room having been releaved of 20 bucks it may have been ok - but not for what we were paying. A trip back to reception was greeted with indifference - I got the impression the phrase "I need another room" was something they heard roughly every four and a half minutes - cos the response was slick - "this is a city hotel and we are full there are not rooms" - not even a sir at the end of the sentence. So we were stuck with it - four nights - little sleep because of the heat and smell and because the mattress had been mugged away from that homeless person - come to thing of it maybe he was still underneath it cos boy was there a lump in that mattress. I stay in hotels on business every week - across Europe - and I can honestly say that this is the only hotel stay that is going to stay with me unti I start getting senile - unless of course I caught some dreadful disease when I was in the room and my days are already numbered....... Have fun at the Pensylvannia Hotel New York my friends...,Ddraig
UR6007040,2006-24-October,Last July a friend and I spent a fun weekend in NYC. Fun at least until we saw the hotel. I'm from Massachusetts so I travel to NYC quite often. On this occasion in July we stayed at the Hotel Pennsylvania. BIG mistake! It is undoubtly the worse hotel I've ever stayed in anywhere. I'd say it's one step up from a Motel 6 roadside hotel. The hotel is large busy and walking distance to everything but that was no consolation compared to the quality (or lack thereof) of this place. We were put on a floor that had not been renovated. It felt like we were in the movie "The Shining." I would not have been surprised to see Jack Nicholson walking down the long dark dreary dirty halls yelling "here's Johnnie." They put us in a room that looked as if we stepped back into the 1930s! The room had two cots (not even ral beds) and green wool army type blankets on the cots. The curtins were filthy and the bathroom NASTY! We ended up going to the management and DEMANDING they put us in a real room. If at all possible stay away from this hotel!!!!!,HVMA
UR6170664,2006-24-November,I was at the Penn for 4 nights with an educational party from 19 - 23 November - there were around 35 of us in total. Was not looking forward to the hotel stay as had read the reviews and knew what to expect (which actually helped a lot - I had imagined it eve worse than it is). Starting with the good: Excellent location - can't fault it for accessibility. Check in was fast. New carpets in the hallways (certainly on floors 2 and 14 anyway). New carpet in our room on the 2nd floor powerful hot shower clean bed linen and towels changed daily no musty smell no evidence of roaches or mice and no bed bugs. Fantastic view of Empire State Building (and Chrysler) from our room on 14th floor. Most of the bell hops are truly miserable but if you can find Frank the bellhop he is a wonderful guy - cheerful and helpful and recommended so many good restaurants and places to go and marked them all on a map for us - if only there were more Franks around. The bad: Dim lighting (although this is fairly common in hotels). The bath you would not want to use (in our 2nd floor room) - not dirty but rusty and was OK to put your feet into while having a shower but wouldn't want to lie in it. Incredibly noisy. 2nd floor is so close to the busy street that never stops and there is no double glazing so the noise is incredible. We had ear plugs with us which I would adivse for anyone staying there. Our room on the 14th floor (I'll get to why we had to switch rooms) had filthy carpets which you would not want to put bare feet on (we had slippers) and the plaster was coming away at various points due to damp I would imagine and it did smell musty. The corridoors on the 14th floor were particularly damaged and had crumbling plaster. The ugly: We had 2 connecting doors in our room on the 2nd floor (not to other members of our party). On the first night we were woken at 3am by a man coming back into one of the connecting rooms who was speaking loudly into a mobile phone I presume - but he sounded as if he was in the room with us. OK I can put up with this everyone is entitled to make a little noise. However 2nd night we are woken up at the same time only this time the guy next door has other males with him (I would say 3 in all) who try to break down the interconnecting door - they weren't just "testing" it there were trying to get in and were shouting too. Quite frightening for two women on their own half a mile down a coridoor from the elevators. Foolishly perhaps we didn't do anything (should have called security I know - but to be honest we didn't want to make a noise as I didn't want to confirm that we were women on our own and I wasn't confident that security would come to our aid anyway). Next morning we went to the front desk to ask someone to speak with the people in this room and tell them that if it happened again we would dial 911 immediately. Front desk sent us to security. Security guy spoke with us didn't take us that seriously (didn't even stand up while talking to us so rude) told us we should have called security at the time and there was nothing he could do now and that we shouldn't worry as it is impossible to get into a connecting door from the other room if you have locked your side (fortunately I had checked it when we first got the room and had locked it as it was open). As he could see we were distressed he did say that he would speak with the deputy duty manager to see if we could move room. Spoke with the ddm who did not once apologise for what had happened. He gave us the room on the 14th floor and said he thought it didn't have a connecting door. Well it did and the room was in so much more dis-repair than the 2nd floor one but as it was a much quieter room and had a view to die for and we knew we just wouldn't feel safe back in our old room we moved. Two other members of our party had to move rooms too - but this was due to mice. No one saw any roaches and no one had any bed bugs. Did it spoil my trip to New York? No way New York is a truly wonderful city and we had a blast. The galleries and museums (we are an art and design class) are absolutely top rate and we could have spent months looking round them. We had some great experiences and I can't wait to go back with my husband - but we will stay at another hotel if at all possible. If you are booked into the Penn go prepared. Knowing what to expect helps a lot and it is then bearable. How do they get away with it? I guess it must be the location and the prices. Thanks to all of you who gave me good advice before going - it really helped.,Merlin5
UR4729524,2006-24-March,I'd give this hotel a 2/5. This was my 3rd trip to NYC so I knew what to expect for this price range. The room was bigger than I expected and the bed and linens were clean. There was a lot of dust in the nooks and crannies of the room and the carpet and bathroom were not the cleanest. The hotel provided the basic necessities but needs major renovation. It's so old that it seems dingy even when it's cleaned. The hallways had plaster falling off the walls and the doors looked like cabin doors on an old ferry. I was travelling as a single female and felt fairly safe with the deadbolt on the door. My room was very far at the the end of a hall so I'd request a room closer to the elevator next time to feel a little more secure. (This is a huge hotel.) I'd stay in this hotel again if the price is right but I'd certainly try somewhere else first.,St_Johns_Girl1
UR4385361,2006-24-January,My friends and i knew this wasn't going to be a glamourous place - for $98/night but we had expectations of general cleanliness. we've all stayed in hotels rooms and hostels all over the world and this was the worst place any of us had ever seen. I think part of the problem was that it was an "expedia" room so don't book through them. My bed was at a 20 degree slant there was no internet even though they say it's available and the carpet beds and walls were filthy. Left in the room was garbage from the people before us including a pair of dirty women's stockings. it was flat out scary.,tenoclock
UR5703286,2006-24-August,for thoses of us who have seen the movie the shinning and visit this hotel you will think about this review. this hotel is very large and not kept up. the room was extremly small the bathroom was a jail cell. i went out for a night on the town and once my girlfriends and i returned we found a homelessman sleeping on our door we called security who was so busy playi ng his psp and eating the only way i get his attention was by bribing him with a chicken kabob. can you belive he let me in my room with out asking who i was or asking for id scary ! the homelss man was asked to move and that he did across the hall just down stairs is the maury show. on a + note the location is amazing in the heart of time square across the street from the manhattan mall and you can always get a cab. your check in process is long and very unorganized. we also paid way to much for that dump truk they want to call a hotel the hall way looked just like the scene in the shinning when corey feildman began to scream "red room" . please do the right thing run for you life in the direction of a hotel. on a scale from1-10 this hotel gets a 1 only because it has a bed and a door. save your self please.,jrain
UR5192463,2006-23-May,Although in a great location just opposite Penn Station in Mid town - an absolutely awful hotel. Grim dirty filthy unclean room curtains that didn't close net curtains that used to be white now grey and no towels. Poor check in service - took over 30 minutes at least 20 people in the queue and only 4 reception staff. Rust and mould in bathroom with constantly dripping bath tap and used chewing gum on floor by bed!!! Charged an extra $95 for late check out (no choice due to late evening departure flight) Maybe our English accents helped when talking to housekeeping and luggage storage staff as received positive attitude and responses. Glad we only booked accommodation only spent as little time in hotel as possible. Whoever is in charge of Housekeeping isn't doing their job properly. A great shame because it's a beautiful building and could be so much more. Definitely not recommended,Tango1967
UR4998223,2006-23-April,OK technically I didn't stay here. Friends did while I booked at the Red Roof Inn up the street. I'll say this...the lobby was hoppin' -- there were long lines for check-in -- so it appears that plenty of people stay here. However when I saw my friends' room on the 12th floor I felt a little skeeved. Was it HORRIBLE? No. Could you survive a stay here? Most likely. But it *is* an OLD hotel -- dark & dank with a musty smell and somewhat of a creepy vibe. Personally I would rather pay a few more bucks and be in a clean & comfortable room.,SommerWind
UR5983503,2006-22-October,20 10 06 Adamson West Yorkshire We have just spent 6 nights in the Pennsylvania in New York. We booked and was recommened by American Express anyway to cut a long story short it is the worst hotel for a large city that we have ever stayed in. When we arrived we were given a room on the 9th floor which was supposed to be a double room and it was the size of a box room. The plaster was all off the wall and left all over the floor I rang reception and told them we were not staying in this room we had booked the room in April this year. We were then given a room on the 6th floor which again was dirty dark and dismal. The t v did not work the hairdryer did not work the shower fittings and plug were hanging of the wall. The skirting board was all mouldy and the air conditioner box stank when you put it on. I would say to anyone thinking of staying there DON'T it will really spoil your holiday please believe what you read and the photos because there are all true.,toucher
UR4369178,2006-22-January,I visited this hotel in May 05 with my boyfriend for our anniverary and i spent the whole day in tears as the room was so small we were unable to even unpack or open the cases on the floor the bathroom was filthy and the bath was peeling on the bottom the staff did try and seem interested but didn't care how much the holiday cost. Our room smelt and the window didn't shut properly.I was disgusted and was devasted by the quality of this hotel in a city that prides itself on being fantastic. Avoid this hotel at all costs!,A TripAdvisor Member
UR4720967,2006-21-March,We have just returned and feel really let down by the hotel. As all say when you arrive lobby great. Service at reception was OK and we were quickly sent to floor 3. If you get a room starting with a 3 ask for a change. It was terrible floors dirty  carpet horrible  head boards filthy  The windows did not close completely  ligthing poor. we were really not happy at all. We went to reception to be informed that as we did not book direct with hotel we get the cheap rooms they put out to booking agents. That was not the reply we wanted and wanted moving. I did use a white lie and told reception we were a party of travel agents finding hotels in USA for our new company to use I also told them we would complain to the city autority about the standards of the rooms and the fire alarms and safety equipmet on the floor (as i am a firefighter but didnt mention that). With this method of negotioating we were moved. Floors 8 / 15 / 16 these have had some renovation and are better but not great BUT CLEANISH. Beware if you get room 1647 - the shower has a mind of its own. one minute your having a great de stress after walking for hours the next your diving out like a bullett as your being steam cleaned or its throwing ice at you. This I did mention to reception but nothing done. After 1 night in this room cleaners went for it and it was lovelyish  next day they didnt do anything and the last we came back to find another bed had been delivered??? Your guess as good as ours. For a plus as others have said Great location  good coffee shop  nice pub / restaurant . This is a budget hotel Dont be fooled it would not get more than 2 star in UK for sure. If your happy with just somewhere to get you head down with major attractions around you then it will be ok. If you know your one to complain about anything dont go here you will ruin your trip with time complaining this city has a lot to offer and great fun to be had go there with the intention of having fun it will provide that for sure. If you want to know more feel free to ask my email address will be displayed.,PaulWhiting
UR5689151,2006-21-August,We stayed at this hotel on a last minute business trip to New York and our experience was a real nightmare. From the moment we checked in we waited 40 minutes to be greated by staff who are indifferent and even rude to customers. As per the rooms they are old dirty and there is that smell... When we check out we discoverd that we were charged more than $ 300 of phone calls to various states in the midwest when we never used once the phones. Trying to explain to the reception lady that we did not place these call and that we did not know of anyone in Missouri was truly a nightmare. After more than 40 minutes of arguments the manager finally came and after a proper verification they cancelled these long distance calls from our bill without even a word of apology. You can find much better hotels in New York for $ 199 with good location and great staff. Avoid at all cost the Pensylvannia.,JSFR
UR4993839,2006-21-April,This was my first trip to NYC so I booked Hotel Pennsylvania on the grounds that it seemed like a good mid-range compromise. Upon arrival the lobby gave a good impression but our room was APPALLING. It seems most of the good reviews go for suites or rooms on the 13th floor but if you consider the size of the hotel you're really taking a chance on getting a good room! We booked a non-smoking room with a queen-sized bed and found the room to be quite small. This was not a problem compared to the dirty worn out carpets and the fact that all soft furnishings were impregnated with a stench of stale smoke. There were prominent mould colonies in the bathroom and our room overlooked a brick wall barely a street-width apart. The highlight was the bedside lamp which was operated by sitting on the bed! For the price you would expect at least a clean room. I would not recommend anyone to stay at the Hotel Pennsylvania at least until the refurbishments are fully completed.,neenz_911
UR5974714,2006-20-October,In spite of all the bad reviews we decided to stay there anyway out of convenience to Times Square thinking "how bad could it be?". We did ask for a renovated room at the suggestion of several people on this forum. We REALLY weren't expecting much and this was worse than we could have imagined. It MIGHT have been renovated in 1960! It was filthy! The least they could do is put a fresh coat of paint on the walls every 10 years or so! There were sticky stains on the door to our room paint peeling on the ceilings the remote to our TV didn't work the bed made a horrible squeaking sound and the carpet was this brown felt-like material that had stains on it. To say it was DATED is an understatement. I am not one to stay in a high priced hotel when traveling...I always look for the basics. I like a clean comfortable no frills room...along the lines of a Courtyard by Marriott or even Extended Stay. This place was worse than any hotel I've ever stayed in. The only positive thing I have to say it that you can check your bags here even if you're not staying here. We came in to Penn Station and needed a place to leave our bags for a few hours and we were able to pay a fee to leave them at Hotel Pennsylvania.,Beachseeker12
UR5183381,2006-20-May,My partner and I chose the Penn because she had stayed there a couple of years back and whilst she admitted it was nothing special it was ok and would suit our needs - what a difference 2 years makes. WHAT A SHOCK! The first room we were given was tiny a 4 foot 6 bed just fitted in there was nowhere to put our cases. The room was damp dirty and there was a horrible smell coming from somewhere. A large section of the bathroom door had actually started to rot/rust away. WORST HOTEL ROOM I'VE EVER SEEN! We approached the desk clerk and told her that we were not prepared to stay there only to be told that there wasn't much else available as it was a saturday night. We stated that if not then we would stay in a top Hotel and ensure that either the Penn or expedia - who we had booked through - would pay for it. Suddenly a room was made available on the same floor as the other (the 5th Floor - 559). This room was by far superior much bigger huge bed and a cleaner bathroom. There were resident mice sharing our room and I noticed under the air-conditioning unit a lot of dust and dirt. Only 1 pillow each and not many towels so I tipped the maid and the following day we had an extra pillow each and more towels. The pillows remained for the duration of our stay but unfortunately the towels didn't. The rest of the Hotel was pretty much run down and grubby. Apparently they are having a refit and looking on the Penn's own website this is evident as the rooms they advertise look very modern and clean - however throughout the week I saw only 2 Contractors. The Penn is nearly a hundred years old so I reckon it'll take these 2 men another hundred years to do the refit. On a plus side - we were able to use the Penn as our base to wander off and look at the many other "better quality and just as cheap" hotels in the area so we know where to stay next time now. Staff were quite ignorant and rude apart from the Maids. The Security is not quite as advertised - Keys were rarely checked for residents using the lifts to go up to the floors; and the hotel advertises CCTV on all floors - the floors are huge with lots of Corridors - only 1 camera on each floor right by the lifts! I doubt if anybody was watching it anyway! I had noticed during the week that there was a lot of Flight Crew from various Airlines staying in certain areas on our floor (5th). On check-out day I took the opportunity to bribe staff to let me see these rooms which to my amazement were excellent!! If I didn't know better I would say that the Hotel were looking after the guaranteed "money" of the Airline Company's and giving the Tourists the poor rooms - but then maybe..... Either way we won't be staying here again!!!!!! It's a massive shame the hotel has a lot of history and you can see where the once Grandeur stood. It's just been allowed to fall into disarray. You wouldn't believe it was owned by the same people as the Waldorf Astoria. At most a 1 - Star hotel. A few tips: If you're not 100% happy with your room DO change it! If they say no other rooms are available ask to see the Manager or say you'll go somewhere better and charge it to them. Food at Lindy's is average and expensive. There's a couple of Breakfast places just up the street past Macy's. Don't go by the Penn's own web site otherwise you will be very disappointed. Remember if staff are rude - You're paying their Wages!!!,egogogo37
UR5489540,2006-20-July,Just in case you don't believe the other reviews posted I'm adding my voice to the chorus. This was the dirtiest least pleasant hotel I've ever stayed in. Our room was filthy; the carpet wasn't vacuumed and there was dirt on many bathroom surfaces. The fixtures were ancient and the room had almost no lighting. We were near the elevators and all night heard the elevators making incredible amounts of noise-- possibly because the elevators were in as poor repair as the rest of the property? I think our sheets were clean which is about the best thing I can say. If you're visiting NYC do everything you can to find somewhere else to stay.,ChicagoTraveler7
UR5629198,2006-20-August,I stayed there on a business trip. The reception at the front desk was rude. I called in many times with my travel agent that I need to have internet access and it is high speed. When I arrived it was late and that the so called "internet access" for them is DIAL UP. I cannot believe it. I think they are MISLEADING. I made SPECIFIC instructions and requirement when making a reservation on my hotel stay. And this is the ONLY time when someone told me internet access DOES NOT MEAN DSL or Wireless but DIAL UP. HA! Not to mention they DID NOT state this when I called and ask about DSL/Wireless. And of course they charge you when you make local calls using their "dial up" internet access. Besides this the room has paints fall off DIRTY and it SMELLS. The bath room has a whole in the ceiling and everything is not on what they described in the website. I complaint to the manager at the front desk and he told me to pay for an upgrade. I personally DO NOT RECOMMEND ANYONE TO STAY IN THIS HOTEL.,ime9889
UR5762367,2006-2-September,I have just clicked on the reviews for this hotel and see it has not changed since we stayed there 2 years ago. My husband was so badly bitten by bed bugs we had to go to the local hospital. We were moved to a different room after complaining and although a little cleaner I couldn't wait to leave. Thoroughly spoilt our first visit to New York DO NOT stay at this hotel. I have since visited another couple of times this time staying at the Milford Plaza which is a little tired in places but a wonderful location.,aitchjayes
UR5899616,2006-2-October,Well after reading the recent reviews I can see that is has not changed since we were ther in 2002. Mould in bathroom. Dirty rooms and staff not good so how does it stay open only thing going for is is the location June from England,JHAD
UR5292337,2006-2-June,I stayed in this hotel for a week in December 2005. My first impression was not to good. The hotel rooms are very basis the furniture was old not that it really mattered. The bed was clean and our rooms where cleaned regularly. The shower was not to good hardly any water came out of it. I ran a bath and the water was brown it looked like a mud bath. I had to let the water run for a while before i took a bath. We found our smoke detector broken and behind the front door. The location was great. I think the most important thing is to have a clean bed and clean towels etc the hotel covered this. The bath was fine when you let the water run for a while. I would probably stay here again. You only get what you pay for at the end of the day.,Westlothian
UR5360799,2006-19-June,This is possibly the worst hotel that I have ever stayed in. I booked three rooms for a recent visit with friends after viewing the Penn Hotels website which describes beautiful rooms all backed up by nice photographs. The description and photographs are deliberately mis-leading. We did notice that there was a separate check in area for airline crew and I suspect that the rooms described are reserved for them. All Three rooms were small and cramped and very old fashioned with small beds old furniture and ever older televisions. The wallpaper was hanging off of the walls and the rooms were badly in need of re-decoration. The bathrooms were from a different era altogether and were in need of modernising. Our bath had actually been painted and the paint had started to come off. The only good thing to say about this hotel is that it is in a superb location.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR4363087,2006-19-January,DONT STAY IN THIS HOTEL! Myself and my boyfriend stayed there for one week when we got to our room there was faeces on the bathroom floor and cigarette butts in the bath when we told the reception we were told well thats what you paid for i quote! Dont stay there please it will ruin your view of New York. We had to buy our own cleaning products to clean the bathroom as the cleaners would not do it. Awful hotel staff horrible. Very rude staff. Worst hotel in the world. Dont be fooled by the reception.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR6472800,2006-19-December,Ok - good things first. If you've never been to NY it is probably the best city in the world ( I speak as a Londoner) The hotel is well located for all the touristy things although its not where I would chose to be based for a holiday. (Stay somewhere around Greenwich Village or Soho instead its ten times better than where the Pennsylvania is located and you are still only a short cab ride or tube journey to all the attractions.) I was in NY on business and had to stay at the Pennsylvania. The hotel is vast and needed to be redecorated about 15 years ago. The lobby is like the waiting room of a central London train station: impersonal busy and chaotic. Staff are too few and far between and they are generally rude. In my dark little room I had plaster falling off the walls in chunks. The bathroom was small and had plastic peeling off the base of the shower cubicle. There were rust marks on practically every metal surface. The TV had terrrible reception and was about 15 years old. I had no Kettle no cups and no safe. Only when I arrived was I told that formal check in time is at 3pm! I got there at 11.30am and was hoping for a short wait. Instead I had to wait around after a long flight until a room was ready. The only thing positive I can say is that I left my luggage with the lugagge porter for about 5 hours after I checked out and he looked after it well and nothing went missing. There are scores of decent hotels in New York: don't be duped into staying at this one just because its a bit cheaper and in what looks like a good location if you've never been to NY before. Heed my advice I've been to the city six times: if you want a youngish trendy scene and lots of bars and cafes stay further south than this (West Village Soho or Tribeca are best - or if your're feeling extremely trendy and don't mind a bit of grime stay in the East Village but it's probably not for families) or if you want a more sedate stay go further north and stay in the tres classy upper east somewhere between 55th and 80th on the East Side of Manhattan! Consider yourselves told.,Gastronaught
UR5626522,2006-19-August,We stayed in this hotel a few years ago but i was reading some of your reviews and felt I had to have my say. The hotel IS cheap and nasty and I wouldnt go back there especially after watching a 'Top 10 Best' programme on the Discovery channel recently. The hotel wasnt the best in New York but it did come 2nd in the list as having one of the best bathrooms in the world-not for humans but for DOGS. Apparently the annual dog show is held there and the organisors book an entire ballroom just so the dogs can crap on the floor. Enough said.,DHuggins
UR5967945,2006-18-October,the only thing that i liked about staying at this hotel was its location. in my opinion i believe that the price per night is too high for what you get (again if location is ALL that your looking for- go for it). the entire hotel smelled like staleness even the bed pillows- which eventually just after two nights could make you sick. no ice buckets or hotel booklets in the room the vending machines didn't work and wouldn't give your change back there was a rusty old mini-fridge the tub and bathroom altogether had mold in spots the bathroom wasn't clean (there was an old soap left in the shower for who knows how long) desk drawer fell apart when it was opened. there were people across the hall being very loud and smoking pot that we could smell from our room. we didnt say anything to hotel staff until you could actually see smoke in the hallway coming from their room. at that time we called hotel staff and security said it would be taken care of but instead security kocked on our door and asked what the problem was because he couldn't smell or see anything...which was funny because when we opened the door we could smell it!! security did nothing. don't expect to be treated like a guest. at the end of my stay i was glad to leave.,votepalantine
UR5148571,2006-18-May,There is nothing positive to say about the hotel. The staff are either rude or incompetent. It took 45 minutes to check in only to find myself in a squalid room which was in a state--not clean and falling apart. The gym is barely functioning there are no amenities nor staff available to assist you. Check out was equally traumatic taking another 45 minutes while the front desk manager yelled at me because they had charged the wrong credit card. Insane. Judging by the people standing next to me they were all equally annoyed with one complaining of the room not being cleaned all week and another one who faced both bugs and a mouse in their room!,ALR24
UR4469503,2006-18-February,The Hotel is situated in one of the best parts of New York City BUT do not expect to much of the rooms in this hotel. They are poor poor poor and the price is high high high but then it is New York and every hotel is overpriced. All in all I think the good outweighs the bad due to the great location of the hotel.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR5356742,2006-17-June,I paid $299 for a room that had a lumpy twin bed and dresser in a tiny room that could fit no other furniture. The bathroom was disgusting; rugs were stained and everything looked dirty. I kept socks on as I did not want to walk on the floors. The water not only ran brown but had particulate matter floating in it. The lobby was misleading as it looks quite lovely. When you get off the elevator on your floor you immediately know this was not the place to stay in. I cancelled my other two nights and found a new hotel. Try the Radisson on 48th and Lexington-same price for a spotless room.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR5473448,2006-17-July,This hotel is by far the worst that I have ever encountered. Three friends and I stayed there for a weekend in July and believe me it was the most unpleasant experience for all of us. The hotel is so run down that it should be demolished. It is astonishing to me that this hotel is open for business. And to make matters worse they have the audacity to charge $189 per night! I just don't feel that you should have to spend that much money for crap. The sheets were soiled the hotels smells old and musty the bathroom fixtures were unravelling and I could go on and on.. The only plus to this hotel is the location. Other than that it is a definate waste of money. Brace yourselves for the worse!!!,ALIBOO
UR4464899,2006-16-February,This was the worst stay at a hotel ever. It began with the crummy service from the front desk staff. They were not helpful. They didn't even try. They seemed to not want to address the issues we were bringing to their attention. Our first room was on the 6th floor. It was in a corner with two windows. Our beds were below the windows and there was a majorly cold draft coming in from them. We turned on the heat and couldn't seem to get a happy medium in the way of tempurature. If the heat was on it was on full blast. Then we all thought we'd shower. Well the shower would only give cold water. No hot water coming from the shower. So we call and the poor maintenance man (he was very nice. He was sick with a cold and was the only maintenance person working for the entire hotel). He told us there was a broken mechanism and that it couldn't be fixed that evening. So he called the front desk and tried to get us a new room. He advised us that there were none available. He was able to get us a room to simply shower in. Thank God! That room was as disgusting as ours with stains on the carpet crud in all the corners and a shower stall from what one might find in one of those hotels that rents rooms by the week! I felt sorry for my feet down there on the dirty shower stall floor! So we stayed the night in that room. We called the front desk the following day to try and get a new room. After repeat phone calls and an attempt to ignore us by not picking up their phones (they must have caller I.D. because they knew which room was calling them) we finally got the keys to a new room. This room was no different from our first room. Nastiness in all the corners stains on the carpet falling curtains a crummy shower stall no plug ins in the bathroom and barely any plug ins in the room...To sum it up it was horrible (in capital letters!) The location is nice but the rooms and front desk staff were the pits. I would not waste money staying there. If I could give any advice it would be to pay a few extra dollars to stay somewhere fit for humans. Or you may even find something for less that's fit for humans! I would never go back to the Hotel Slumsylvania.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR5618006,2006-16-August,Booked this hotel in the last minute wasnt expecting it much as its a 3-star and cheap and it perfectly proves: you want cheap cheap is what you get. We stayed 8 nights totally not worth it ( $185/night) We had a double-bed room on 8th floor the room is filthy and humid the AC hardly works there is always a strange smell in the room. We tried to open the window and the window stuck in so bad that a 36-yr-old gym-goer had to try really HARD to get it open. The maid is not friendly at all when we ask for 4 extra pillows (as the ones the room had are thin as a sheet of paper) she replied with an attitude: " I will get you two  I can't get you four." The bathroom is only equipped with a hair dryer which is broken totally useless. Lobby staff is snobby as if we owe money when we ask for secod pair of key card. The only advantage of the hotel is its location right across from Madison Square Garden and Macys close to all the shopping places subway lines and tons of restaurants.... but the hotel itself is completely a disaster seriously.,chococarol
UR5352055,2006-15-June,I have stayed in the hotel Pennsylvania many times over the years. If you are looking for a 5 star hotel look someplace else! If you want a basic hotel centrally located next to everything then this is the place for you. Penn Station is right across the street. In addition you will find the flag ship store of Macys around the corner along with excellent shopping along 34 street. Most major subway lines stop right at your door step. Take the Long Island Railroad out to East Hampton or Long Beach take a stroll up to Times Square or take the subway to the Village. I felt safe and the rooms are basic. cs June 2006,LongBeachCal
UR5613387,2006-15-August,Their phone reservation system is aweful -- no one answers. The hallways and rooms could be the filmset for the movie "Taxi". The rooms are very out of date dirty and smell bad. Stay away unless you can't afford better.,jtpenman64
UR4460230,2006-14-February,Just returned from taking a school group to this hotel for 3 nights and the experience was terrible. The rooms were small and still had the last guests rubbish on the floor. The heating did not work on anything but full which meant that we had to have the window open - in February during the worst snow season for years. The piece de resistance however has to be the uninvited guests-we had mice in the room and they did not change our room for us. The hotel exterminator said that they were common place in the hotel. Oh there were also 1000 dogs in the hotel-some with fleas as there was a dog show on-not that we were told in advance. The barking made a change at night from the mice eating in our room! Stay there at your peril no cheap room is worth all this!!,A TripAdvisor Member
UR6441758,2006-14-December,Went to New York for a week and really enjoyed it. Mostly out during the day and evening for the whole week however when in the hotel room did not like it one bit. Very poor standard room and I had expected something good. Staff member was abrupt and I had not finished talking to him before he turned and started talking to someone else owever i'm told this is what to expect in New York. The air conditioning unit was huge old and ridiculously noisy when on and had to be considering it was July. Did not have any meals in the hotel so no comment here. I think the like for like standard compared to an equivalent European hotel is very poor. Also the bathroom styles differ from European ones. The strange American toilets bowl overflowed it was awful.,terimeri
UR4972696,2006-14-April,My family & I stayed at the Hotel Pennsylvania in Oct 2005. On arrival we were surprised at the length of queue at he desk i.e. 50metres/ 45mins but this was New York so what the hell. The foyer was lovely - polished brass and chandeliers everywhere quite impressive actually. The rooms however were quite a different story. The carpet was filthy stank of cigarette smoke and had cigarette burns all over. The paint was peeling from all walls. The bathroom was full of rusty pipes and mouldy grout. The furniture was either damaged or had bits missing ie. drawers gone. On a positive note: the sheets were clean fresh and white as were the bathroom towels. Thank goodness for small mercies for I was ready to sleep on the street!!,CoastGirl
UR5950914,2006-13-October,A warning to all business travelers looking for a reasonable rate in the vastly over-priced NYC hotel market-stay away from the Hotel Pennsylvania! For $220.00/night you will get rooms with peeling paint dim lighting crumbling bathrooms general uncleanliness and a bad musty smell throughout the hallways and room. Throw in long check-in lines and indifferent workers and you have a totally miserable stay. They cater to tourist groups from overseas; what a sad 1st imprssion of New York they will get staying here.,mab313
UR6438414,2006-13-December,Overall I was not pleased with this hotel in the least. Although the location was good the service and security lacked. I would not stay here again and certainly would not recommend to a friend. As I was checking in (after waiting in line for about 15 minutes) I noted 3 separate people come the counter upset and complaining that their key did not work. Upon entering my room the smell was musty and I noticed peeling paint and mold in the bathroom. The overall condition of the room was clean but very shabby and in much need of rennovation. I also noticed that my dead bolt had been removed from the wall. Being that I was staying by myself and had overheard that there were some problems with keys working properly I did not feel safe sleeping in that condition. I called security and told them my lock was broken and I was told they would send someone up. One hour later no one had come yet so I called again. I waited another 30-45 min....still no one. So I packed all of my stuff up and waited in line to request a new room (about 10 mintues this time). The woman who helped me had no concern why I was requesting a new room but quickly granted my request. When I made it up to my new room low and behold...no dead bolt again! I was very tired at this point and decided to risk it and go to sleep. I put my suitcase in front of the door not like that would do any good and left the bathroom light on so I could feel safer. Needless to say I didn't sleep well. The room was pretty quiet overall you could hear running water from the neighbors and I could hear someone peeing...but the halls were quiet. Overall the service was horrible and conditions were very very shabby. Most importantly I did not feel safe. If you are on a budget and just need a place to stay where security and quality is not your top priority this place may suit you just fine.,toilgal
UR5792130,2006-12-September,the only thing this hotel has going for it is it's location. across the street from penn station madison sq garden 3 blocks from empire state walking distance to time sq etc. the hotel itself is old fashioned and out dated badly in need of a make over! my partner and i arrived for a four night stay and were shocked to say the least at the poor quality of service not to mention the bedroom. our room was tiny with just about enough space for the bed! the en suite door didnt close properly and the shower leaked all over the floor. the room was not particularly clean and we noticed that housekeeping staff didnt pay much attention to the basics. we were given two key cards for our room both of which didnt work! i wouldnt recommend this hotel nor would i consider returning!,De2006
UR5946144,2006-12-October,I stayed at Pennsylvania hotel for five nights in june 2006. The location is fantastic opposite Madison Square garden. The check-in was fast (we arrived in the evening). Though it's a huge hotel there where many elevators so you didn't have to wait long to get up and down. Our room was on the 15th floor. We had a room for three persons. It was quite small. There was no wardrobe where you could hang your clothes and no place for the shoes and also no place to put the suitcases except on the floor. When we came there where towels for only one person but roomservice was quite fast and brought some more. In the bathroom the tap was dripping during the whole stay. The plumber obviously tried to fix it but without results. Fortunately you could close the door to the bathroom so it didn't disturb our sleep. The zink was also quite clogged the plumber couldnt fix that either. So the rooms are not very good but if you are not very particular the location excuses a lot.,Lantis
UR5458707,2006-12-July,My wife and I stayed here for our one and only trip to New York and just happened to be flying out the same day as my sister and her husband which was not intentional. We stayed here and they stayed in Parc Central. They were about the same price due to a special offer they got. However they were truely not in the same class. When we checked in the staff couldn't really be bothered to speak to us and we practically got our key thrown at us which was not the best start. We then went up to the room and there were stains on the walls that looked like water stains and I don't mean small ones they were about a rulers length in diameter and the room smelt horrible. At which time we went down to ask for a different room. Now I hate complaining about things on holiday but the room was actually disgusting. The second room we were given was definately better but by no means good. It still looked like it needed a good clean. We then saw my sisters hotel and we were gutted that we didn't stay there. We did even think about transferring even though we would not have got our money back. I would strongly recommend that you don't use this hotel however if you are looking for a nice one the Parc Central is lovely and it is where we will stay next time!!! It also has a very nice Bar which was good as I needed a big drink!,PJholiday
UR4967388,2006-12-April,As you walk into the lobby it looks a lovely hotel but as soon as we got from the lift on floor 2 it was like your worst nightmare. The walls in the hallway had holes in them doors had not been painted for years and holes in the ceilings. One of our rooms had not been cleaned and the other overlooked a flat roof which was FULL of rubbish. there was a pipe leading from one radiator which obviously didnt belong there and one rooms windows didnt stop the wind coming in. The hotel is in a great location but dont be fooled by that.,sheap
UR5055350,2006-11-May,As you say you get what you pay for but even chain Motels are better than this! I would NEVER advise any friend of mine to stay here as I would be to embaressed. Excellant location but oh dear what a dump! Dreadful!,A TripAdvisor Member
UR6363831,2006-11-December,My mom sister and booked a room for the weekend of the 8th-11th for a girls weekend shopping trip. We paid almost $400 a night. On arrival the lobby was gorgeous and looks like a high end hotel. Our stay began horribly when we checked in. The woman at the reception desk demanded our passports which we did not have or bring because we are all NY residents. When we handed over our driver's licences she let out a big huff. The rest of the check in was rather normal. We waited about 10 minutes just to get an elevator to the 8th floor even though there are about 12 elevators. We got into our room it was not at all what we expected. The hotel's website says that all of the rooms have been renovated....they definitely werent. Our room looked like the inside of a roach motel not a $400/night hotel. The lamp shades were not on the lamps and some of the bulbs were completely blackened and burned out. The heaters knobs were broken off and there were no adjustments. We called maintenance since the heater wouldnt turn on. They told us all we could do was plug it in to use it and unplug it to turn it off. So the room would either be blazing hot or freezing cold. When we began to settle in we realized the bathroom was not clean and there was even feces (poo) left on the toilet seat. In utter disgust we complained and were moved to a room on the 6th floor. We were told we were being upgraded to a Junior Suite. We got the new room key and went to enter the room but to our surprise the room was occupied! A woman shrieked...when we realized what was happening we apologized and went back down to the reception desk. This time we were sent to the 10th floor. The room we got was much more acceptable but certainly not worth $400/night. It was more like a "Comfort Inn" type room. At any rate it was clean and had new furniture but for being one of the "renovated" rooms it wasn't all that great. Looks like they only put half the effort into the renovations. Another downside is that they charge you $4 per bag to store luggage. Checkout is at noon and if your flight is not until later in the day you will have to pay per piece to store the luggage in the basement. I will not be staying here again. The location is great. It's right across from Madison Square Garden and less than 1 block from Macy's. If you don't care what the accommodations are like....,pack513
UR5600989,2006-11-August,The room smelled of mould and urine. The smell seemed to come fron the A/C-unit The bed was awful and gave both of us back pain. The wall paper had come off the wall and there were cracks in the walls. When we complained about the nasty small they did not at all seem suprised but gave us a room on the 3rd floor. That room was a lot better even acceptable. Staff was not very friendly.,josabeli
UR5936092,2006-10-October,The promise engendered by the grandour of the entrance lobby with its marble and chandeliers quickly turned to dismay when we arrived on the 14th floor and were met with a musty damp smell in the corridor. There was a general feeling of shabbiness about the place. The walls were marked and the external corners looked like they had been attacked with a hammer. The room door looked like something from a prison or a mental asylum. Inside while the linen was clean the room itself was shabby and badly in need of renovating. A small rusty fridge sat on the floor. The bathroom looked like it hadn't been touched since the hotel was built in the early 20th century. The bottom of the door frame was rotten from dampness as the shower tended to spill onto the floor. The plain white tiles showed signs of mould in the grout. On the positive side the hotel is very centrally located on 7th Ave at 33rd Street just opposite Madison Square Garden and Penn station. Empire State Building is just around the corner and Times Square just a few blocks away. We didn't spend much time in the hotel as we were on a sight-seeing trip. However if you are looking for luxury give the Pennsylvania a miss.,Dublin 11
UR5046654,2006-10-May,I recently stayed for 3 nights in this establishment with my sister and child on a 4 day trip to New York and I have to say I have never been so disgusted in all my life. I would say that I am a avid traveller and have never stayed anywhere so dirty. This hotel needs to be closed down and fumigated!! Our window in the room didn't open there was no ventilation NO pillowcases on the bed bedding was filfthy... the carpet well was beyond explaination and the bathroom well I would describe as third world conditions. IF you have booked this hotel please change your booking before you travel !!!,A TripAdvisor Member
UR5445140,2006-10-July,myself and my partner stayed here for 4 nights during holiday season.We had been told not to expect to much so we went with an open mind.on arrival the lobby was very glam (lots of gold and marble)we had to que for 40 mins to check in which was not great but the reception staff were very nice and very helpfull. our room however was a disasterit had damp/mould patches on the walls our bed consisted of 2 mattresses piled on top of oneanother covered in a sheet (damp)the carpet was wornthere was rust in the sink/bath and a damp smell throughout the room.we had a window which looked out on to what looked like the main airconditioning fans for the hotel which needless to say made noise constatnly.we asked could we be upgraded to a better room and when asked for our room number were told that our room had been recently renovated and was the best they had.we opened the window on our first night and it became loose in our hands and was then stuck open for the entire stay we complained but nobody came to fix it.we spent nearly every minute (apart from time asleep)out of the hotel. the hotel apart from the above mentioned was very central which was its only good point. i would never return to this hotel i would never even think about satying in a hotel like this again.its been a real eyeopener.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR4956431,2006-10-April,I stayed at this hotel a few nights ago and it was one of the worst experiences i have ever had! They were rude to us from the moment we first checked in they mixed our room up twice at one point causing our stuff to be locked in a room we couldn't get into then proceeded to blame us for the mistake. When we asked to speak to management and tried to explain our dissatisfaction through describing our experience we were literally told by a member of management to "get to the point" and never once received so much as an apology. The rooms were pretty crappy and i got charged extra money on my account and still have not been able to get in touch with someone who can fix it. If you you don't want your New York experience to be ruined like mine Don't stay at this hotel!!!!,A TripAdvisor Member
UR5025295,2006-1-May,We stayed here in May 2004 and couldn't understand the terrible reviews now however I do! The hotel is in a fantastic location for sight seeing and the price is very reasonable. However... Our room was a good size we had a view of Madison Square Garden out of our window..... and our very own pet mouse!!!! When I informed the staff of our little visitor she told me it was my fault for having food in the room...which we didn't! I did however speak to the bell captain who informed me that the previous owner had taken every penny profit and left the hotel to fall to rack and ruin. The new owners are refurbishing room by room which if you have ever seen the size of the place you will realise is no small task. I would strongly recommend staying here if you can get a refurbished room as it really is the best location in New York. Enjoy your stay! No amount of rodents can spoil New York!!!!!,zophie100
UR4566783,2006-1-March,The hotel is across the street from Madison Square Garden. That's the only positive thing I can think of to write about what might be the worst hotel I've ever stayed in. Please understand that I've stayed in some real pits in Guatemala Indonesia Costa Rica and Eastern Europe. Generally I can go with the flow - what can one expect for $10 a night in Costa Rica? Well the $10 hotel in Costa Rica was infinitely better than the grossly overpriced dump that is Hotel Pennsylvania. Check-in was a nightmare. After waiting in line for 30 minutes to check into my room I was advised that my reservation had been "downgraded" to a king rather than two doubles despite our "confirmed" and "guaranteed" reservation. This was not good news for me and my uncle - two decent-sized men. There was nothing the hotel could do it would not adjust the rate and the indifferent staff was totally insensitive and unresponsive to our plight. Judging by the numerous unhappy faces and occasional profanities uttered by others leaving checkout we weren't the only victims of such unpleasant check-in surprises. The room was tiny outdated and astoundingly dirty. As filthy as the room was the common bathrooms and hallways were worse. Words cannot express the magnitude of filth that has permeated this property. How does it survive inspection? We were able to get a rollaway bed. The only place in the room it would fit was wedged between the foot of the bed and the opposing wall. We essentially had a tiny room with almost wall-to-wall uncomfortable bedding. Avoid this hotel.,demonspawn
UR6310726,2006-1-December,As god as my witness this hotel is it's own Ellis Island. People not familiar with NYC - just coming in and out of the City are checking into this hotel and accepting it as their destination. YOU DONT HAVE TO STAY HERE!! I checked in went to my room and turned right around within 30 secs. of what I saw. The furniture is dirty and hallways long and dark. I asked to see another room and that was even Worse! Go to the Marriott Residence Inn on 39th and 6th. For about 40.00 more a night you get a suite. Treat yourself better than staying at a place like hotel pennyslvania,br8kodawn
UR4826463,2006-1-April,I had to stay at this hotel when I went to New York for a conference back in December. The photos on the website suggested a decent place to stay. The word "historic" mde me think of smallish outdated rooms with not much in terms of decor and technology. That is what I expected... and I got much more than that. First the service in the Lobby was terrible. I got in at about 5am and tired.. just wanting to clean up a little before going to the conference center. They wouldn't let me check in because their accounting department had not given them my reservation paperwork and they had all the intention of charging me $900 for one night's stay. When I finally got to check in the gal at the front desk said that she was going to give me one of the rooms on the top floors because those were the best ones. I don't want to know what the others looked like. 1-. Telephone dialing did not work. 2-. The outlet in the bathroom was above the sink (electrocution hazard) 3-. The hot water was not hot at all (in December you want hot water in New York) 4-. The bed was creeky and sagy 5-. The conforter was dirty and coming apart at the seams 6-. There were BLOOD stains on the sheets and bedbugs 7-. The carpet looked like it had not been vaccuumed since the hotel opened 8-. The tub had cracks 9-. The wallpaper was peeling 10- The air conditioner/heating unit was extremely noisy. As I left I chatted with someone else staying there and the feedback was pretty much similar - this hotel is DISGUSTING! I hope they do something with it.. it's a wonderful building and should be brought back into it's original glory.... but the way it's looking... it's ready for a wecking ball!,A TripAdvisor Member
UR4002875,2005-9-October,I knew something was odd when the man who supposed to guard the entrance to the elevators looked like he'd rather be at a funeral. The rooms are disgusting...there were rings around the toilet that seemed older than me the bed was filthy the alarm clock did not work and the air-conditioning was broken. If you like reality tv you would pleased to know that you can hear everthing your next door neighbor does - in bed and toilet. Noone deserves this. I wouldn't wish this hotel on my worst enemy _ i am positive that purgatory is cleaner and better kept than this. i have stayed at many hotels in NYC  some cheaper and am only writing this to informa tourists that you don't have to stay here to save money. Its not worth it. Save yourself the hassle & pay an extra $30 to stay somewhere better kept. I am not an elitist but really anyone who writes a review saying this hotel is worth the cheap cost or any other "positive" spin is either an employee trying to do damage-control grew up in barn with wild boars or is a recently parolled ex-con who wouldn't know any better about comfort. Don't stay here!!!!!,A TripAdvisor Member
UR4101413,2005-9-November,We have just returned form a 6 night stay in this hotel. I had read the reviews only after booking. I travelled with my friend from Germany who had booked the hotel through a local travel agent. The first room we were given was small with one double bed and very shabby surroundings. We asked for another room with 2 beds as promised by travel agent. 2nd room had 2 twin beds but no electricity and grafitti next to the main light switch indicating this had been a longstanding problem. Once again we returned to the desk with luggage in tow to be given another room. This room had a blind on the window which was ripped and falling off the window. The enamel on the bath was all chipping off. By this time we bacame quite angry and were told by the person at the desk that indeed he agreed some of the rooms were sub-standard. We were asked at this point to return in 2 hours at 4pm to see what could be done. At 4pm we were given the keys for room number 4 which had 2 double beds and this was of a more acceptable standard. The hotel has obviously been lovely in it's day but is in dire need of refurbishment throughout to bring it up to expected standards of today.The maid service was fine with a complete change of towels every day and the beds were clean. The best thing about the hotel is its location. Very central and within walking distance of most attractions but centainly nearer the basic budget accomodation and not 2 star. 2 weeks prior to this I stayed in 2 star accomodation in Tenerife and found the hotel pensylvannia of a poorer standard.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3451338,2005-9-May,First of all the hallways were very dreary and scary to say the least I felt like I was on my way to my cell instead of hotel room. Then God help when I finally reached room 1260 the door was thick iron dented rusted and built like a vault. When I entered the room I was so disgusted with its decor and uncleanliness (rust everywhere water stains view of a building's wall curtains were half hung and green dingy hard towels to say the least). I was so disgusted and afraid that something would come crawling out the bed or the floor that I sat up in the chair and refused to sleep that night. I told my firm about my experience and the attorneys refuse to use this hotel EVER AGAIN!!!!,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3258667,2005-8-March,I was really worried about this hotel after reading the reviews. Some of my worries were justified. When we checked in there was no line but when we got out on the second floor my heart sunk. The wallpaper was peeling off the walls in the hall and some of the doors were rusty and looked liked the had been forced. Our room was large but none of the lights were working and it stunk of ciggarette smoke it was dirtysmelled of damp and had a huge brown stain and part of the tiling was hanging down. We had paid for what was called a 'standard special' website which was described a recently refurbished. This wasn't. We went down to recption where our room was changed to the type we had actually paid for. This was on the fifth floor. It was alot better. Again the room smelled of ciggarettes and was smaller but it was clean and had been refurbished. However we still wern't completly happy but the hotel now didn't care. We were told that this was one of the better rooms and that a refund wasn't the hotels responsiblity but the firm we had booked with online. The hotel had our money and didn't give a damm. Apprantly the refurbishment was done six years ago which seems to conflict with what other reviewers have said. Maybe the hotel cant get thier stories streight. After a good nights sleep (as the beds were comfy) we decided to stay in our room as the smoke smell was getting less and it meant we could spend more money on the important things like having a good time. To give that room it's dues it ha really comfy beds and a great shower. The only problem was some peeling paint in the bathroom and the smell of smoke. However when you have bad jet lag and have been on a flight for 7 hours the last thing you want to deal with is problems with the hotel. I wouldn't stay in this hotel again. Somtimes it's not worth the hassle.,Louisa847
UR3539199,2005-8-June,I approached this hotel with trepidation as I had not told my husband about all the negative reviews - but it was so cheap for the location and we were only staying a couple of nights. We arrived by car and first impressions were awful as the staff on reception were unbelievably rude very unhelpful about parking the car and refused to check me in as I did not have the passports available. By the time we had sorted out the car and the passports the rooms we had booked were taken. (We were 2 adults and 4 children). We were then given a key to an enormous apartment on the 17th floor entrance hall huge lounge/dining room 2 very large en-suite bedrooms. Sure it was old and shabby but very clean and fantastic views! My previous experience of New York hotel rooms is that they are no bigger than cupboards so boy weren't the kids impressed! So all was forgiven. But why oh why do they have to be so rude?,dragonannie
UR2990003,2005-8-January,We arrived on the 30th of December and I for one was expecting something combining fawlty towers and say the darkest depths of hell! Apart from a chunk of the doorframe to the bathroom being missing and a shower that flooded the floor everytime you washed it was alright. We would have had a nice view of nyc but it looked like the windows had been cleaned sometime during the 1950's! The room was clean tidy and the shower was hot. Overall the hotel needs some serious work but who cares when you're in new york!,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3646805,2005-7-July,Don't be deceived by the elegant lobby which greets you at this hotel - the checkin desk is badly understaffed and during busy times you can expect to be waiting several hours to get your key. Taking the elevator up to our floor (7th) I immediately got a bad feeling. The carpets were worn and threadbare the corridor smelled like an old hospital paint and wallpaper was peeling off everywhere and the place had a generally decrepit feel to it. When we got to our room we found that there was no fridge a terrible musty smell in the room and the carpet under the beds strewn with old rubbish and mouldy potato chips. The air conditioner was faulty and had leaked all over the carpet creating potentially disease-spreading damp spots. Electrical points hung off the wall. Wallpaper peeled everywhere and the ceiling was full of painted-over cracks. The bathroom was clean but basic however the sink leaked where it had been badly cracked (looked like it could collapse at any time) and disastrously it was not possible to open the bathroom from the inside due to the handle being broken which caused my companion to get trapped in there until one of us returned to the room causing all kinds of panic. The beds were single beds rather than double beds for people used to the extra space. Room service were not at all helpful and had a "life's tough" attitude to our predicament. I got the impression they were more than used to complaints. Their website says the hotel was recently refurbished but I checked out three of the floors at random and could see no evidence of any such refurbishing. Not only is the hotel unpleasant but it could be a health hazard. Poorly fitted or broken electrical fittings/appliances are undoubtedly unsafe; damp carpets and poor cleanliness spread disease and any restaurant would immediately be shut down if these conditions were found - I find it hard to believe that it is legal to maintain hotel rooms in this fashion. The hotel rates were around $170 - $190 per night and while I was not expecting luxury I was at least expecting clean and functional. Fortunately we were able to contact our travel agent cancel our booking for a refund and move to the infinitely superior Hotel Belvedere near Times Square an excellent and well maintained hotel at slightly more expensive rates. Hard to believe that this hotel manages to stay in business - it is the worst I have ever encountered in my life and far short of what I would expect for New York City.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3342766,2005-7-April,You may go there but do not wish all expect the location and the access. It is true that all of the rooms are not clean. It does not matterbecause I only sleep and take a shower in the hotel. All of my important time was spent outside. If you would stay a cheep hotel which has a bath I recommend there. You may be able to get a room under $100 per day in Net. Do your best!,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3644342,2005-6-July,This is the worst hotel on the planet! Do not stay here! We were warned by a couple from England. We did not think that it would be that bad. The lobby is beautiful. However we stayed in room 200 and our room looked worse than any pictures on this website. It stunk! The beds were like brick. There was not an alarm clock. There was a film in the bathtub. The phone was an old push button kind. There was not even a signal for my cell phone. I was so scared to stay there. I went down to the lobby and demanded my money back. Grey Line Tours still has not refunded me. Please do not stay here! It is the worst hotel on the planet.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3993420,2005-5-October,I could not recommend this hotel to anyone. At first sight the lobby looks fine quite busy staff not too friendly but have a lot to deal with. Location is just about all this hotel has going for it. The hall was filthy dirty the doors of every room were marked and dirty. The room itself was quite large with two double beds but this was not really an advantage as it just gave more space to see the peeling paint mould on the walls stains on the carpets. This would almost be bearable if you had paid relatively little for the accommodation but at $250+ per night this hotel was utterly disgusting. The next two nights we went to stay in the Comfort Inn on W36th and the difference was unbelievable. The hotel didn't look like much from the outside but inside it was spotlessly clean and comfortable with breakfast included in the price.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2977367,2005-5-January,Hooker in next room wins Oscar. Hotel was dirty scary and crumbling. The lock on my door did not work. I prayed my floor did not fall through. Shower was dirty and bathroom littered with trash. Furniture broken and very old. Remote for TV was under bed and boy am I sorry I looked under there! Flea bag! Don't let the lobby fool you.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3992378,2005-4-October,We stayed at this hotel as a treat for our 25 wedding anniversary. We were very very disappointed indeed. The previous pictures are accurate. the hotel corridors are dirty shabby in desperate need of refurbishment. The rooms were exactly the same the maid certainly didn't get a tip. The foyer was lovely except we should have noticed that all the plants and anything over 7 ft high were covered in deep dust. Do not go to this hotel  when we complained there was no reaction at all.

UR2975790,2005-4-January,Just spent 4 nights in this hotel. the room when we arrived was very dirtyI went down to receptionafter a long wait I spoke to manager I was told it was the only room they had 690. I was told to speek to housekeeping this I did. When we returned later the room was just as dirty. It was like this the whole holiday. I took about 10 photos of the dirt.eg. stains on carpet black mould on three legged fridge also bathroom wall. Thick dust on skirting boards broken toilet flusher also table drawer missing. It was the dirtiest hotel we have ever stayed in,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3162019,2005-4-February,"You get what you pay for". Hotel Penn is loud dark & dirty. The sheets are scratchy and coarse. The characters roaming the hallway are suspicious. I had a general feeling of being unsafe in the hallways and elevators in daylight! The only upside is the central location directly across from Penn Station. Staying here made the difference between an unpleasant and enjoyable stay. I stayed 2 days for a meeting- d/n get a fax sent to me nobody knew where our meeting room was located internet access down. Scores of fellow employees complaining. Spend the extra $50/night to stay elsewhere. You'll be glad you did!!!!!,MGPNewport_RI
UR4075939,2005-31-October,We booked our room online and were obviously fooled by the photos from the website. The lobby is not a good indication of what kind of room you will be getting! Once you leave the lobby and get off the elevator at your floor you will step into a horror film. The carpets are dirty and coming apart and are taped down with duct tape in places. The walls are filthy and the doors to the rooms are the strangest things I have ever seen in a hotel....and they are all stained and crumbling. And all this is before you set foot in your room! When me and my wife set foot in our room we both almost burst out crying..it was so bad. We didn't expect any luxury for what we were paying but what we did expect was at least a clean place to lay our heads at night. This was NOT that place. The "double" bed was tiny delapidated and the mattress was worryingly stained. The bed linen was awful with a heavy itchy old blanket on top. The room itself was shocking...paint was peeling everywhere...the walls doors and carpet had stains all over them. The A/C was busted. The bathroom was actually not bad in comparison althougth I must say I tended to squint a bit when I was in there so I didn't spot anything that might have freaked me out. They were very random with the clean towels...some days we got some some days we got none. It was a good job we were to spend minimal time in our room...we got up early and stayed out very late most days just so we could be away from the place...so much for a nice relaxing lazy weekend in New York! There were always long lines at the front desk and check in seemed to take forever. The staff were kind of unfriendly as if they were doing us a favour by checking us in at all. I'm glad we only stayed here for a weekend because I couldn't imagine being there any longer than that. Anyone that goes back to stay here after one visit much be a masochist! I would never stay here again...and would definitley advise anyone I cared about NOT to stay here. Do not be fooled by the online photos or the location spend a bit extra money and go and stay somewhere else. This is what we will do next time. This place is daylight robbery and I'm surprised that people can get away with running such a dump of a hotel in this day and age.,RChappo
UR4153614,2005-30-November,We stayed at the Pensylvania Hotel Nov 2005 when we arrived at the hotel we walked into the foyer and thought WOW we have done good for our money however the rooms are very shabby basically clean but wouldn't go so far as to sway clean. The best thing about this hotel is its cheap and a location to dream about.,macca1Uk
UR3840735,2005-3-September,Seen conflicting reviews on this board and am glad that I had my camera. The room was dirty the carpet stained and filthy the door frame rotted as you can see in the pics and the service poor at best. Not recommended at any price I felt icky the whole time I was in the room and did not go barefoot on the carpet,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3632761,2005-3-July,I stayed here for 3 nights in June and was amazed at how disorganised things were... It took 45minutes to check in and the queue behind us was growing. A great first impression! When we got to our floor my heart sank as I saw the state of the corridors and doors (very grimey). We entered the room to find the bathroom whilst broadly clean had been fitted decades ago. The rest of the room was reasonable but lacked maintenance and genuine cleanliness. In summary the location was fantastic the lobby looked good the room had just about been kept clean but I would NOT recomend this hotel.,The_Hickster
UR4159348,2005-3-December,Room 697 has NO heating and although the outside temperature was below freezing a call to the maintenance engineer produced no action! Reception and Left Luggage staff were very helpful and friendly and the position of this hotel is superb - in the centre of EVERYTHING and one block from Macey's! Room equipped with hair dryer (we used ours as a rather ineffective mini fan heater!) ironing board and iron plenty of clean towels bed linen changed etc. - but a drink-making facility would have been welcome. A cavernously-huge hotel famous in the 20s 30s 40s but long overdue for a refurbishment. For a short stay in the centre of NY when time is important it's OK but if visiting in the winter - check the heating in the room is working!!,mau083
UR3721215,2005-29-July,Before I had read any reviews about this hotel I booked it online at Expedia because of the great price and location. About a week before our trip I came upon this website and decided to read the reviews about Hotel Penn. Lets just say after reading all the reviews and maybe seeing only 1 good one I was not very excited about our familys first trip to NYC. Since we couldn't get a refund my husband and I decided to go for it and if it was really that bad we would try and find somewhere else to go at last minute. We got to the hotel with our two small girls ages 3 and 9 at around 3 in the afternoon. There was no line for checkin so we got our room very quickly. I asked the woman who gave us the room for the doublebeds and she said fine. They put us on the 7th floor in room 747 and as expected when we got out of the elevator it smelled terrible and was basically a whole in the wall place ( litterly) We opened the door and we didnt even go inside all the way before we decided to switch rooms. We called the front desk but no answer so I hung up. My husband called the operator and we got a answer and we had to make up a problem so we could switch rooms. My husband being a doctor told the woman that our two daughters had asthma ( wich they dont) and were coughing and sneezing from all the mold and dust. I guess they were afraid of a lawsuit because they called us back in 5 minutes and told us that they had a room for us on the 16th floor. We went up there and the man was very nice and apologized over and over again for the other room. The new room was very spacious had a tv 2 queen size beds a large bathroom and a desk along with a cot. The man told us that this room was a superior upgrade and was usually reserved for Hotel Penn members but he felt bad and decided to give it to us for free of upgrade charge. He even told us to go down to the front desk and recieve the citypass books that he reserved for us. We stayed for 5 nights and after the second night we sort of got used to it. Although the blinds broke on the windows and there was pubic hair all over the bathroom from guest before us the maids brought fresh towels everyday and were very understanding when my 3 yr old had a accident in the cot and brought us fresh sheets right away. It was a great location but the resteraunt Lindys was not good at all. the food was dry and overcooked. We walked everywhere and never took a cab except to the airport and we easily walked to Times Square withing 10 minutes depending on traffic. I dont think we will stay there again but Im glad we gave it a chance,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3813575,2005-29-August,First the good news - location is fine. Now the rest - the lobby was probably impressive when the hotel was built but it is now forbidding and a bit grim. This is nothing to the corridors which were disgustingly dirty and unkempt. I went with friends and we tried to jolly ourselves up on our way to our rooms; these were awful (3 rooms) all dirty with 'interesting' stains in a variety of places (carpets walls - someone had obviously had something on their hands some time ago and had wiped it on the walls never to be cleaned off!). Bathroom so old that the bath enamel was peeling. Many months of dirt/hairs/stuff at edges of floor. A chambermaid came in every day and changed the sheets and cleaned the bathroom but nothing else. No vacuuming dusting or anything that needed doing. Poor woman was obviously just doing what she was told as all rooms were the same although on different floors. The electricity looked pretty lethal. Straight away we all asked for another room (I was happy to have thrown money at the problem and paid extra) but nothing doing there was nothing else and the staff couldn't have cared less. Don't go - pay more and go somewhere else.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3426329,2005-29-April,This place deserves no stars but that's not an option sadly. This hotel is the worst piece of garbage ever constructed. All this talk of "you're going to be in the city; how much time are you going to spend in your hotel?" is absurd. If you're going to spend the whole day walking around NYC you need a decent place to sleep or you're going to get progressively more sore and tired as the days pass. You are not going to get a decent night's sleep at the Hotel Pennsylvania AKA The World's Worst Hotel. The beds are not just bad they are substandard. Are you comfortable sleeping on a slab of concrete covered by a sheet? Then book away. Do you enjoy sleeping in a room with a door and walls so thin you can hear everything that goes on on your floor? Then this is the place! Do you enjoy rude front desk employees peeling paint stained carpet and bedding and pipes that make noise? Then you've found your hotel. If you don't enjoy any of these things then please for the love of everything stay somewhere else. Anywhere else. I seriously had a better night's sleep the last time I slept outside for concert tickets.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3506149,2005-28-May,Upon arrival hotel is situated in a great spot with Madisson Square Garden just across the road and only a short walk to Times Square. Despite many other reviews i have seen the check in was not very busy we were quickly handed our card and set off to the room. My partner and I were only in the City for 1 night to do a quick bit of shopping so the fact that the hotel started to look a bit old fashioned and in need of a good clean and makeover didn't worry us too much. When we got to our allocated room on the third floor we eventually found the room (it's rather hard to find doors as the numbering on some floors seems somewhat unusual to say the least). I opened the door and the room was very small the carpet was dirty the bathroom was disgusting a tap that dripped constantly stains all around the bath paint peeling off everywhere. The aircon didn't work in the room either the view out the window was of a concrete wall. The last straw was when i looked at the alleged double bed! I've slept in bigger single beds! I went down to the front desk and told tem i was not happy and was not prepared to stay in the room. With no further questions i was moved to a kingsize room! This to was fairly disgusting stains everywhere again but no dripping tap and it was a front facing room so we looked straight down on the Madisson Garden complex this really made up for the problems. Like all New York hotels it was very noisy and we had to keep the window open as again the aircon unit was useless. The hot water took about 10 minutes to get hot and the remote control on the tv didn't work nor did the internet connections. I would not stay there again if i'd have not been given the second room i would have made friends with the local homeless folks! Also reception staff upon checking out where not the most helpful or polite people it may be an idea to have more than 2 members of staff on duty for a hotel that alleges to have 1700 rooms!,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3709083,2005-28-July,I have been staying at Hotel Pennsylvania with my girlfriend for a couple of days. It has been a disaster and the hotel should be called Transylvania instead. We had to stand in line for at least 45 minutes until an arrogant Chinese front desk guy with a very bad attitude checked us in. I asked for a renovated room and even offered to pay for an upgrade. He told us that all the rooms were the same and gave us the keys. Sure the lobby and the ultra modern elevators with little TVs showing CNN are kind of neat. But the floor with pealing wallpapers and dirty carpets did not promise very much. The room then was a disaster. The bathroom's ceiling was moldy and dirty. It seemed like the carpets have never been cleaned during the last 20 years. And the worst thing: We have been asking and reserving a room for two. That tiny stinky hole only had one very little bed (not even queen size) in it. So I picked up the phone and asked how all of this was possible. After holding for about 20 minutes I was told to come down to the lobby to the concierge and get a new key for a room in the 5th floor (they gave me a room number). My girlfriend waited in front of that room with our luggage (of course they did not offer us any help with our bags) while I talked to the concierge who did not know anything about a new room. I was get into the check-in-line again. Finally I got another room in the 10th floor. So I had to pick up my girlfriend again in floor number 5. Our final room was not great either. The carpets and wallpapers have been very old but at least we got two beds. There was no window curtain to darken the room but after calling again and waiting for about an hour two guys brought one. It was the worst hotel I have ever experienced (and I have been to the YMCA). And the service was not good at all. If you check your luggage you have to pay six dollars per bag! And one day we saw a newly modernized room while the door was open. So really not all the rooms are alike like the front desk guy told me. I would not give a single star to this type of place. I would never ever stay there again. It made the whole trip a bit worse. Don't stay here!,Ocrame
UR3236247,2005-28-February,First of all to be fair I will say that we stayed here a couple of years ago and possibly things have changed for the better. Our room was tiny - no bedspreads or headboards on the beds. Worst of all was that our beds were against a wall that contained the bank of elevators. All night long we heard the elevators going up and down. We would have left immediately but the price and location were good and we didn't feel like searching around for another hotel with 2 children in tow.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR4307340,2005-28-December,I booked this on the internet based on the lovely photos and location. The location cannot be faulted central to everything you want on a trip to Manhattan. The lobby is beautiful and sumptious on arrival. Check in service was quick and polite. However when we stepped out of the lift on our floor I thought we had entered an episode of Kojak. The corridors were filthy and looked like something that had remained uncleaned for years. There was what looked like blood spattered all over the door to our room. All the doors along our corridor looked as though they had resisted attempts to kick them in. The furniture in our room was pleasant and in good condition. The linen and carpets were clean as was the bathroom but the room like the corridors looked like it had not been decorated or painted since the hotel was built. Overall we were dissapointed that the hotel photos on the net are obviously very selective and do not give a very honest impression. We enjoyed our stay but had we known in advance of the state of the rooms I would have booked elsewhere.,picklefactory
UR4147002,2005-27-November,I only wish I had read the reviews on this Hotel before I booked. The first room they gave us was a nightmare paint peeling from the walls water stains on the ceiling handles on the dresser were broken off. My wife went down to the lobby to request another room which they gave us and was somewhat better with only the paint peeling from the ceiling and the shower fixture was barely hanging on. If I could have gotten out of staying here I definately would have.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3614846,2005-27-June,AS other peple wrote on this site I couldnt keep my mouth shut. I had to tell evrybody who plans to go to NYc NOt go to this flthy hotel. I was shocked the moemnt I checked in. The service and the arrogance of the receptionist really shocked me. Is this supposed to be the Hospitality industry? When I got to my room floor..OMG the place looked like hell. The carpets all stinky and stained. Cigar butts all over the floor.... When I opened my room and went to the bathroom I was scare to use it. There was a coucarouch on top no my familys toothbrushes!!! yuckkkk... Ill post the picture soon... IM not lying!.... We tried to speak to sombody but they wouldnt care. NYc was full we couldnt find any other place to stay. There were paapers and rubish under the beds and one day our room wasnt claened at all... not even the beds were made....... I wasnt expectiong a luxurious room... but how about hygene? Is there a place where i can send my commentaries about this hotel? I mean government wise or something... hospitaly industry?? It is totally inadequate that this hotel can be open to public in this conditions.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3938671,2005-26-September,Based on the price I expected it to be bad but not this bad. I was on business trip hotel was convenient to the office I was visiting. Room was on the 12th floor which was supposed to be the executive floor. The hallways are gloomy; the room doors look like they have the top of a metal coffin bolted over the middle portion of the door - I wasn't sure if it was meant to be a bullet proof safeguard or an attempt to cover up an old door. The bathroom was old the faucets leaky the deadbolt on door didn't work bedspread stained carpet questionable (I laid towels down to walk on) the alarm clock did not work and no one ever answered the phone when calling the operator for a wake up call which made me feel unsafe. The best part was the free coffee in the 12th floor executive lounge that no one told me about (I read about it in the room directory). Might be ok as an alternative to a public hostel but not as a place to stay for business or vacation.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR4053320,2005-26-October,I'm not entirely sure Hotel Pennsylvania should be classed a 'Hotel' I imagine most young offender institutions are cleaner and have newer fixutures and fittings. My room stank (a combination of smoke and dog blankets) the bathroom was a shocking shade of brown plaster and paint were falling off the walls the TV didn't work and the bed was an interesting alternative to 'sleeping rough'. All for $230 a night. Please don't go to this Hotel. Either save up and stay somewhere better or see if you can get arrested the boarding conditions will be similar except care of NY's finest.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3502021,2005-26-May,I checked in and was disapointed with the room It was dull and dreary. I tried to change rooms but all 1700 rooms fully booked I was told this. I dont think so. Bath was filthy had to run tap for 10mins before hot water came to shower. A mouse was running along the floor and we took 2hours trying to catch it. It then ran into the connecting room so someone else was chasing this mouse. Spoke to the cleaning supervisor and she said that they would investigate heard nothing more. It is probaly still going from room to room. The hotel is in a great location. The amount of people in the lobby each day is amazing. The hotel needs a good facelift and extra staff on check in days as queue's very long. I stayed on the 3rd floor but the lift made journeys to all floors which I had to take - unwillingly. before it returned to the lobby. These other rooms could be ok.,Richoooo
UR4299999,2005-26-December,I initialy stayed in this hotel two years ago on a christmas shopping trip with my mum ( aged 30's and a young 60's) The location is fabulous with easy access to the downtown areas Soho East and West Village etc and the shopping around Rockerfeller centre to the North. It is right on Macy's doorstep which was handy given the three day snow storm that blew in with our arrival. The hotel itself is shabby but is currently under renovation. Our room on that occasion was tired looking but clean. The bathroom was fine...black and white 1930's style ( original maybe?) but lots of hot water good shower and clean white towels daily.There is a coffee shop in the lobby that does good English Breakfast tea for UK visitors in the morning and a bar restaurant that does good food for evenings when the weather gets the better of you My mum has since returned on two occasions both for shopping and sight seeing and has just returned from another christms shopping trip.( no funny smell) Again she was in an unrefurbished room but found it comfortable and clean. In short this is not a hotel for a luxury trip or romantic weekend away. It will remind you of the Shining but if all you need is a comfortable clean place to sleep in a great location this is fine. After all the money you save on the hotel can help with the shopping!!,Spirited
UR3417166,2005-26-April,It is not cheap. I paid C$240 (tax & services charge included) for two nights. The carpet was dirty and the bed sucks! There was water stain near the window. The bath room was a joke. I am glad I only suffered for two nights.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3938100,2005-25-September,the location of the hotel is the only good thing about it apart from the impressive lobby service is non-existent we got a single room instead of the double we booked online the room was dirty mouldy and smelled of damp with practically no view whatsoever. i found the hotel staff(the few who spoke to you) very unhelpful and unco-operative. if you are not fussy and just want a good location to stay in ny then its ok but if you are looking for a bit extra..then forget it..would i stay there again....? not sure.....,A TripAdvisor Member
UR4143627,2005-25-November,My husband and I actually stayed at the Pennsylvania back in July so why you may ask am I choosing to put up a review now over 4 months later. Well last night we watched one of the SciFi Channel's spectactularly bad movies entitled "Dagon". The story revolved around a group of 4 friends run aground in their yacht in a storm who then end up in a small coastal town somewhere in Spain (I think). The town is populated by strange fishlike people who sacrifice unsuspecting travelers to their fish god. One hapless guy attempts to escape the rain by checking into the only local hotel. We see his room peeling wallpaper gurgling spluttering plumbing dirty sheets uncommunicative staff... If yo've stayed at the Pennsylvania you already know where I'm going with this. Yes it was the Hotel Pennslyvania...minus the gills and sacrificial pit of course - it's bad but not QUITE that bad! I wouldn't recommend it but if you're going to stay here (or you're already booked and can't back out now as was our situation) then just be prepared. They WILL put you in the room from hell at first but just be ready to go straight back down and ask for another room until you get one you can live with. Good luck.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3499446,2005-25-May,we booked before reading all the terrible reviews & was tempted to cancel... the room was basic but alright.. my mobile charger would not work in any of the sockets.. but the location was FANTASTIC.. and am planning to go this december again but will book an upgrade,A TripAdvisor Member

UR3610686,2005-25-June,If you are on a budget and basically need a bed for the night then this hotel will suit. The location is very central opposite Madison square garden a block from Macys and the subway on 34th Street. Looks can be deceiving as you enter the hotel it seems very impressive nice lobby shops and a couple of restaurants. When you get to the room however the problems start. The carpet a dark brown colour and rather dirty looking the bed sheets have some type of stains (seem to have been washed though). There is climate control in the room so at least you are cool/ warm if you need to be. The bathroom is a basic toilet and small tub with overhead shower which is all in need of a good repair. If you will only sleep here and be out most of the time then you may find it bearable.,sarach
UR3228844,2005-24-February,I'll be honest I read the reviews that came before me and thought they were all just being overdramatic. It's a two-star in NY what do you expect? So we went anyway. We checked in on 2/16/05 and were supposed to stay 7 nights. We checked out the next day. Two stars are two too many for this dump. Most places in our price range were already booked for the weekend but we were lucky enough to find the Super 8 in Times Sqare a one-star according to this website that was head and shoulders above the Pennsylvania. Everything that has been said in the other reviews is accurate. It's not even worth it by budget hotel standards.,Seattle099
UR3933201,2005-23-September,The hotel was dirty and the rooms were very inadequate let alone basic. The plaster was falling off the walls where the bath seal has broken. The room smelt of dampt. This hotel seriously needs a great deal of modernisation. The photos advertising this hotel on other websites were a million miles away from the room we had. It was very disappointing but it was a bonus we were only there for three nights.,Chitch75
UR4044983,2005-23-October,I am used to visiting NYC and have experienced many hotels - small boutique modern chain old art deco etc. The old city hotels from the 30s such as the Edison or the New Yorker are fine and have bags of atmosphere. This hotel has one thing and one thing only - location. On 7th Avenue in midtown you are near Macy's Madison Square Penn Station and not far from Broadway TImes square etc. It also has an OK bar in the lobby and a good left baggage service. BUt it is dingy and dark the corridors and the rooms are filthy and peeling (bear in mind I am an unfussy straight man who is hardly ever in his room not Hyacinth Bouquet - so when I say filthy..). The bathrooms are inadequate and disgusting the beds and bed linen are horrible. Trust me you dont want to stay here under any circumstances and even by NYC standards the 108 I paid was a disgrace. David,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3494902,2005-23-May,The WORST. No A/C no Internet connection my "renovated" room had plaster falling off the walls and busted/missing baseboards shower deviated between scalding and lukewarm. Never again. Location is good but the New Yorker is in the same area. Next time I'll try it since it CAN'T be any worse. Possibly the worst hotel experience I've encountered in 15 years of business travel.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3694820,2005-23-July,Having stayed for 3 nights in June with friends from England I can honestly state that this hotel is a total disgrace. Apart from a half decent lobby the rest of this hotel should be demolished as a slumunfit for human inhabitation Even the mice were throwing themselves on mousetraps to commit suicide. The corridors were like the wing of a prisondirty dingyand morbid. The first room I was given was filthy smelling strongly of cheap bleach the blinds were hanging off the windows and could not be movedthe carpet was covered in dirtand the dark 2ftx3ft cupboard that was supposed to double up as a wardrobe was a joke. This hotel was a terrible welcome to New York after a 8- hour flight from England.Please tour opperators do yourselves your city and your country a favour and remove it from your records totally.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3800258,2005-23-August,We visited the hotel on a weekend in June 2005. The lobby was impressive so we expected a good room and were really disappointed. Negative: The room was shabby not renovated (as our travel agency told us) everything looked really old including the bathroom. Also the walls were very thin and as our room offered a connecting door we could smell the smoke from our neighbours. Complaint at reception didnt help we were told that this room on the 4th floor was the best they could offer. Posivite: Bed was comfortable. Large new TV with a good selection of programms. Fridge in room (though a bit loud) free deposit boxes available at reception and best of all: very good place to get around located directly at Madison Square Garden Times Square is only a 10 min. walk away! Tip: Grayline Bus Tours for Sightseeing is worth the money. They have several hop on/hop off tours (all tours for 50 $ for 2 days!) We got around town and learned everything we need to know with the experienced tour guides.,Steph-Germany
UR3293090,2005-22-March,I have stayed here twice now and hated it both times. Because of Hotel Penn's price I decided to give it a second chance after the first stay. Bad Idea. I go to NYC about every month so I know about other hotels to give a fair comparison. Sure it's in a good location across from Penn Station in lower Midtown but look around the area there are many more hotels in the same appx. area. Based on my two stays here (In the past 4 months) this is the rundown: Upon walking in the hotel notice the amount of people sitting around in the lobby. Hundreds of people just waiting to check in because rooms are not ready yet. Be prepared to wait in line for at least 30 minutes to simply check in if they have a room available. After checking in and heading to elevator area notice the sign saying "No Alcoholic Beverages Beyond this point." I'll talk about this more later. After getting to my floor (the 13th floor that is... hmmmm... most half decent places don't have a 13th floor) I immediately noticed the Coffin like doors peeling wallpaper and smell of vomit. Got to room was not too bad until I went in the bathroom. Mold was all over the ceiling of the bathroom. Both times I have stayed at Hotel Penn I have gotten sick. I believed it to be food poisining until the second stay and am now thinking it was the Hotel. I really wish I would have taken pictures of the mold to post on this site... Beds are very uncomfortable. Heater makes tons of noise and the temperature knob could not be adjusted in ours. After 5 minutes of the heater being on it must have gotten to be 80 degrees in our room. After a call to the front desk about issues they say they would be happy to move us to another room but they don't have one available and they "couldn't do anything about the mold." Bottom line go someplace else and spend a little more money. This place is a nightmare. Club Quarters Midtown is nice and not much more money.,davidt0526
UR3490910,2005-21-May,This hotel may be immortalized in song but its 21st century incarnation is AWFUL. The lobby is clean but the hallways and rooms are utterly filthy. Once you step off the elevators you may as well be visiting a fleabag motel off I-90 in the midwest somewhere. A complete ripoff...and I don't care about the ideal location or the storied history -- this hotel is being marketed as a great value and safe place to stay in NYC. FUGGEDABOUTIT. This place is a complete dive.,PikePlaceTraveler
UR4255050,2005-21-December,I brought a bus group of 56 people to New York and unfortunately stayed at this hotel. I requested the refurbished rooms but they were a disaster. The rooms were dirty with mold in many of the bathrooms. We requested upgrades but they were not any better. I asked for some compensation and that was refused. Don't be fooled by the lobby. I will never stay at this hotel again.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR4038805,2005-20-October,For the price I paid ($275.00 a night) I expected more. We did NOT GET THE ROOM WE RESERVED! When we complained the staff was as cold as ice! Although we were given a different room it too was filthy. Mold on the bathroom walls carpet smelled and looked like they barbequed on it. And the the doors to the rooms look like a coffin. Believe me as soon as you walk into the room you'll wish you were dead! Someone in NYC tourism has to be aware of this. There is NOTHING about the Transylvania that would make me refer ANYONE here. If we ever find Usama Bin Laden I say stick his --- in the Transylvania. That will teach him! I came home and signed up for a Marriot Rewards Program. I figured if I pay the big bucks I'll at least get comfort as I did when I stayed at the Marriot Marquis in June. DON"T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY! Unless you are the Beverly Hillbillies.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3288557,2005-20-March,I was a part of a group that stayed at this hotel for a weekend getaway. When we arrived in the lobby it was absolutely beautiful. The elevators were equipped with televisions so that you could watch CNN on the way to our floor. When you stepped off of the elevator that's when you entered the TWILIGHT ZONE! We went to our rooms...it smelled was dirty and just old. And we were in the newly renovated wing. There were no towels and it took us hours to receive them. I had a bed that looked like it had been slept in so I called maid service to have it changed and was reprimanded by the maid on duty. My friends and I couldn't even get a good night sleep because we were so uncomfortable. We then had native New Yorkers visit us at the hotel they were so excited because they heard so many wonderful things about this hotel until they too entered the TWILIGHT ZONE!!! My only advice after this experience is to enter at your own risk!!!,hbg2pgh
UR3212041,2005-20-February,The hotels lobby is very decieving - looks amazing shame the rest of the hotel isnt like that. Our first room stank of damp had a ripped up yellow pages book scattered across it and had a bucket full of a yellow coloured liquid and the bathroom was filthy. The hotel room doors arent very appealing either to me they look like orginals from when the place first opened. So after complaining (the guy at reception looked like he had heard it all before) we got shifted to a slightly better room didnt stink and had a nicer door was still very dingy tho. Realise the hotel is only a 2 star but to be honest i dont think it deserves it.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3985049,2005-2-October,this hotel is cheap by New York standards. Some floors are very old with others a little more modern. Beware of the old floors these have Pink and Green decor. On check in we were given one of these rooms on the 13th floor. the room was disgusting with stains all over the bathroom and the paint on the ceiling was damp and mouldy the lighting was very dark so as to disguise the terrible room. On complaining we were given a better more modern room on the 7th floor this was OK but still the hotel gave us the creeps.,Angiecas
UR4080178,2005-2-November,I booked a weekend break to New York as a present for my hysband's 40th birthday. We were assured that the Pennsylvania Hotel is a "really nice hotel". When we got there we queued for ages to get checked in my husband had to write his name on a piece of paper so that the receptionist could copy it onto the computer. Our room was still being cleaned when we went up to it. In the corridors the walls were crumbling from the damp and there was a very strong smell of air freshener. When we got into our room well the dark brown carpet was dirty and sticky the paint was peeling off the skirting boards and the white tiled ceiling had great big brown stains on them. In the bathroom the towel rail was rusty the bath was stained and the tiles had black (mouldy) grout in between. There was an adjoining door to a suite next door the walls were so thin we could hear the conversation of the people next door. They said this was a three star hotel when I booked it I would not put a dog in there!!!!,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3432731,2005-2-May,DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL! It is filthy and the rooms have mold on the ceilings! It smells and the staff is NOT HELPFUL! I will never recommend this hotel or stay here ever again!!!!,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3629968,2005-2-July,Please don't listen to the people who say this hotel is ok it ISN'T! I could go on for ages about how horrible this hotel is but I won't. All I'll say is the staff were rude the rooms were basic and very unclean if you have any standard of personal hygeine you won't be happy here! We stayed for one night (was meant to be 4!) and ended up checking out at 6am having not slept at all. Staff didn't care and we walked down the street till we found a decent hotel after all a cardboard box would be cleaner than this hotel. I'M NOT EXAGGERATING!!,RosieSmith
UR3323064,2005-2-April,We stayed at the Hotel Pennsylvania for 4 miserable nights. Found out about this site only 4 days before our trip. Read the terrible reviews about the hotel so tried to book with other hotels but could not get a comparible price. So called the hotel with our concerns and was assured that the people that write those reviews request the cheapest room available and get "unrenovated" rooms and that since we had booked through a web travel agency we would be assured a "renovated" room. We decided to take our chances and stay there. Big Mistake!!! Our room had mold on the bathroom ceiling and tiles and the paint was chipping of the ceiling. The toilet leaked. The curtains were torn and filthy. Shower curtain was filthy. This was the first hotel I stayed in that I felt dirtier after showering than before. There was vomit on the floor in front of a tenth floor elevator that despite 2 phone calls to Housekeeping and then the front desk did not get cleaned up for over 2 days. This was all shared with the manager who seemed unconcerned about the problems and more concerned about getting off the phone and rid of me.(would not meet face to face with me). Lesson Learned: It's better to pay $100-$150 more a night for a nice clean room.,karissa
UR3287959,2005-19-March,Date of Staty 3/18/05 All the negative reviews are correct. This is one of the worst hotels out there. Arrived around 1 pm. The bellman took the bags and brought me to the check in area. He never told me that we could not check in early. There were no signs indicating only checkin after 3 pm. Waited a half hour and was greeted by a miserable front desk clerk who advised us we could not check in. I requested to check my bags and was told that it would cost $4 per bag and I had to walk down into the basement to check the bags. The room was like a cell block with cinder block walls 13 inch tv that did not work filthy bathtub filled with rust and threadbare towels. The beds were clean thank heaven! There was no security when we returned to the room at 1 am checking to make sure we were guests. I expected a tourist class hotel but it did not even make that grade. The only positive is the location in midtown. I am glad we were just staying one night. If longer I would have had to change hotels.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3681385,2005-19-July,First of all it took 45 minutes standing in line just to check in. Now the room! GROSS and very small. You can barely walk around the room it is so small not too mention the smell yuk! For some reason the A/C was off so i turned it on no cold air hmm? So I called front desk they said they would send someone up noone came. I called again and of course noone came. I then proceeded to the front desk demanding another room. I got one. This one was worst than the first. The window was open the air was off the room stunk like mildew and the carpet was wet. So I went to get another room. I got another one. Pretty much the same as the first but the A/C worked (still never cooled off all night) Now the soda experience. Went to the vending machine on my floor 12th did not work. Proceeded to the 11th floor out of order next the 10th floor no machine whatsoever now the 13th floor miracle it works. cold 12oz soda for $1.50 I travel frequently on business. This is by far the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. Spend the money and stay somewhere else!,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3017762,2005-19-January,I stayed here last August for business. The rooms are quite large but I had to stand in line for an hour to check in at 7 pm. When I got the desk there was a slight hitch due to my name being misspelled in their computer and the woman "helping" me not bothering to ask me for my credit card OR confirmation number even after I volunteered that I had them at the ready. After announcing there was no reservation for me she stared at me blankly until I lost my temper at which point she rudely informed me she was trying to help me and asked for the confirmation number. Overall it was not the experience I was looking for after a long day of travel and work.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR4250572,2005-19-December,Believe the reviews. This is the worst hotel I have ever stayed at. Its cheap (by New York standards) for a reason! We thought we were getting a bargain - we were had. The lobby is great but when the elevator door opens on your floor the smell hits you. Carpets are filthy. It makes me shudder just thinking about it.,Leyton
UR3789675,2005-19-August,Ths was the WORST hotel I have ever stayed at. The lobby is very deceptive because it looks nice. Marble floors and what not. As soon as you get off on your floor though you notice that this place is in serious need of repair. The hallways were dingy and soiled. The doors to the hotel rooms didn't even look like they would be your actual door. I was thinking "Is this a joke?" The room itself was disgusting. The ceiling in the bathroom was peeling off. The water drained from the shower out of the bathroom and into the bedroom so the carpet was always wet. The carpet looked so gross that I never went barefoot the entire time I stayed there. I also wore flip flops in the shower because it looked so unsanitary. The linens looked like they hadn't been washed in a long time too. The only good thing about this hotel was that it was cheap and in a great location. But I would never stay there again.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3389325,2005-19-April,This was the worst hotel experience I have ever had in my life. Worse than the motels on the highway. The room we first walked into was disgusting. Nothing was fully cleaned. There was still comet or something in and on the toliet. There were dirty tissues on the floor. There were stains all over the floor. The comforter was so gross with stains all over in including some food stains that hadn't been cleaned yet. I couldn't even put my stuff down because of what all I could imagine getting on it. So we went downstairs and asked for a different room. We got the "manager's pick" which was a complete dump as well. The door of the room was falling apart as included pictures shows. The floor still had stains all over it. The best part was the pull out couch which had iron burns all over it. The TV remote didn't work at all and the TV barely worked because the buttons on the TV were broken. The comforters were still stained. The only good thing was at least in this room there were no dirty tissues on the floor. We kept the light and tv on all night in fear of rats and roaches. The rooms are huge the second room even had a walk in closet so I don't understand why they don't keep them up.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR4030249,2005-18-October,I nearly cried when I saw the first room they put us in (on the 3rd floor) condom wrappers on the floor bathroom was disgusting fusty smell generally dirty looking we complained and they moved us to 8th floor a little better but we still werent happy. We knew that the rooms above the 10th floor had been refurbished and we wanted one of those so we complained again. This time they put us on the 15th floor but all they could offer was 2 double rooms luckily I was with my sisters and we were happy enough to share. The room on 15th floor was great if they had put us there first I wouldnt have thought any of these bad reviews could be true. Lovely Oak finished bed dresser TV Cupboard and dresser table. Bathroom was lovely too. room was cleaned everyday and fresh towels left. Perfect location for NYC visitors. My advice to anybody travelling is COMPLAIN COMPLAIN COMPLAIN!,Shopaholic1981
UR4125243,2005-18-November,No No No No No - just don't go here. It should be a good experience - the hotel is in a great location and the lobby lulls you into a very false sense of security. Sadly the rooms the service and the overall experience are just one steep downhill plunge into a pretty abysmal hostel environment. Pity the prices charged don't reflect this as you might then have some idea of what you're letting yourself in for. I can only echo most of the other comments about dingy rooms poor decorative state staff who seem so used to complaints that they just don't care...the list of problems just goes on. Do yourself a favour - if you've booked a room in this hotel go round the back and sleep in their dumpster - it will be better than the room they provide!,mallard2
UR3483506,2005-18-May,After walking around with a friend who lives outside of the city and the two friends I went with we decided to head back to our room. After a while of just sitting around at about 4 AM he decided to go home to get some sleep before he had to come back the next morning to be our tour guide again. It was just us three girls in the room. One friend slept on one bed and I shared with the other. I slept with my head at the foot end of the bed so I could see the front door clearly. After being asleep for maybe an hour I heard a slight noise coming from the door and somehow it woke me up. I lifted my head and a man was peeking his head in. With only a lap top light in the room it was hard to tell what was going on not to mention me being half asleep. I thought it might have been my friend coming back to stay with us because he missed his train. so I said "Is that you?" the man stood there and looked at me for about 15 seconds then he crept into the bathroom. I sat up and said quietly "there's someone in the room you guys." the girl I was in the bed with got up and said something. the friend in the other bed woke up and thought I was just hearing things so she got up to look in the bathroom. she saw him and immediately started screaming which started a chain reaction of screaming girls. we thought maybe someone would hear us and bust in to save us. he just sat in the bathroom. one of the girls went to call 911 and tried to turn on the lamp by the beds... it didn't work. we just dialed 0 to get the front desk. when someone finally answered my friend said "THERE'S SOMEONE IN OUR ROOM WE NEED HELP." she was told to "hold on" and while she was on hold she heard the person who answered say "guess who it is." it took them at least 10 minutes to send someone from security up to the room. after about 3 minutes my other friend used her cell phone to call NYPD. they got there just before the hotel's security arrived at our door. somewhere in between all this the guy who snuck into the room snuck back out. the man from security who was a little creepy-looking seemed to have an attitude with us because we called the cops. so the real cops left and the man from security took us up to a different room going through some back elevators that were really creepy. the security man was asking us questions about the person and they decided it was probably housekeeping. excuse me? I didn't know housekeeping just walked into peoples rooms and had afros and wore neon orange t-shirts and jeans for uniforms! and apparently the same thing had happened the night before because the lock on the door was broken! we had to call my friend to come back and stay in the new room with us because we were still so shooken up. needless to say we were not charged for the night. we spent the rest of our nights with the friend who lives nearby. I was so scared the rest of our trip. I must have only got about 8 hours of sleep the entire time. so the location and prices are really good but it's not worth it. who knows what would have happened had I not been woken up by the door?,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3574415,2005-18-June,My husband and I stayed at this horrible hotel last Halloween for 5 nights. It is by far the worst hotel we have ever stayed in. The reception area is alright but the corridors and bedrooms are so shabby and filthy. The carpets are dirty and badly stained and very threadbare in places. Our room was on the 7th floor. The paint was peeling off the walls. The air-conditioning wasn't working just as well it was autumn and not summer that we were there. One of the taps in the bathroom didn't work tiles were chipped the remote control didn't work. The decor was dark brown carpet and beige like walls that were so depressing. The hotel was so bad that it coloured our opinion of New York. Just thinking back on the hotel is enough to depress me. Yuck.,Deisemum
UR3680328,2005-18-July,I have to admit I was in a panic after I had booked in and prepaid for this hotel on my first weekend away with with my BF. My concern led me to ask for a renovated room as I read that only 2/3 had been renovated. Now I'm not fancy I have 1 star'd it across Europe so I can handle modest but not dirty. This hotel was what it claimed to be good location and clean (enough) to satisfy a semi OCD germophode like myself. I checked that room over every day tipped housekeeping made sure I made my requests directly to the ladies rather than call down to the desk. Sure the sheets were worn in someplaces but obviously clean. Towels were fluffy and plentiful. The bathroom was a bit insitutional but we were fine with it. I stopped judging carpets after watching DATELINE and saw what they found on the floor of a room at the PLAZA. It was close to MACY's which was great mostly for the food hall for quick and good take away. Everything you need is right around the corner. Upon leaving we checked our luggage in the left luggage were were only going to check two bags but the gents working were super friendly and insisted that we leave the third as well. I was hesitant as there would be no claim tag given but all was well upon our return. Warning the reviews are true the basement of this building is dismal and I would advise NOT using the washrooms in the lower level. Given it's age and volume of people that flow through there you have to cut this place SOME slack. As others have said if you are used to the PLAZA stay away from here but if you are accustommed to modest accomodations and not looking for ambience give this place a try. It was pretty affordable and super central.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3014046,2005-18-January,We stayed at this hotel for new year 2004/2005 for 4 nights. Upon arrival we checked in and were told that our rooms were not renovated rooms as they had none left we specifically booked renovated rooms through our travel agent. Upon leaving the lift to floor 3 the carpets were old and dirty and the doors were in a terrible state. The room was disgusting like the hotel out of the shining the curtains didn't close the blinds were hanging off the windows were filthy etc etc hadn't been done since the seventies. I refused to stay in such a hell hole and we complained at reception so were given 'free upgrades.' These rooms were much better but still not the renovated rooms and maybe only rated a 2 star. The location was fabulous however. My advice is don't book this hotel under any circumstances it should be closed down whilst it is renovated.,Scotland_UKLouise
UR4249053,2005-18-December,we've booked this hotel for the 2nd time. But there won't be a 3rd. In 3 years nothing changed and the rooms looked (and smelled) the same.,Gloria77
UR4028080,2005-17-October,I will never again stay in this hotel. It was a nightmare! The hall smelled of gas the rooms smelled like a nursing home there was a strange white stain on the floor in the hall when you ran the bathwater BROWN flakes came out hard bed and no service whatsoever. It was so dirty and dingy. The only plus is it's really close to times square. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY! Stay somewhere else.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR4123111,2005-17-November,The disconnected smoke alarm was hidden by the fact that there was no ceiling light. We had to keep the bathroom light on and the door open the entire time (even in daylight hours) in order to see as it was so dark. What makes me most angry is that I've just got home and found they've charged $185 to my credit card. We'd paid in full checked in and out on time didn't use the phone didn't buy pay per view movies or use the internet and left the room in perfect order so I have no idea what it's about. The ever surly staff refused to deal with it when I just called told me to use another number and not to bother for a while as all their computers are down. Also don't expect to sleep in this hotel the plumbing is such that if anyone in the nearby rooms flushes their toilet in the night the whole corridor wakes up.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3675832,2005-17-July,Stayed one night in this dump. I guess in NYC you get what you pay for - $160. The hotel from the outside looks great and the lobby is quite posh but the room we had was probably the worst room I have ever stayed in EVER! The room had two single beds and was tiny the carpet was filthy the walls were chipped and dirty the hardware on the door was broken the bathroom was a nightmare ceiling was peeling and mold was clearly visible. The bath tub was chipped and the faucet felt like it would come off in my hand. The hotel provided soap and towels. Nothing else. I slept on top of the bed in my clothes - no way was I going to get in the bed. I was glad to get out of there. Luckily I was up for only one night with a buddy. Had it been my family we would likely have complained and asked for a different room. Location wise the hotel is right where we wanted it to be close to the subway and a good starting point for sightseeing. We will definitely research better next time though. Horrible. Stay away.,SteveinMD
UR3780903,2005-17-August,Booked two rooms for 4 nights. Stayed on the fourth floor. Definitely _not_ one of the rennovated floors. The carpets were filthy and threadbare. The bathrooms were old not cleaned well and didn't function well. Dripping faucets. Blasting hot shower when the toilet is flushed. Grimy grout in the corners. Hair from past lodgers. The sheets didn't seem to fit the beds at all. Every morning the bottom sheet was completely dislodged. Tempurature control seemed to have no effect whatsoever. The fan control did work however. The front desk staff was not helpfull and downright rude at times. Here is my favorite. We arrived two hours before check-in time. We had to pay $4 a bag to store them in the basement for those few hours. The basement appears to not have been touched -- upgraded or cleaned -- since the 1919 opening. Paid $160 a night per room. I have stayed in $35 a night places (not in NYC of course) that were nicer. Bottom line . . . stay elsewhere.,bdcassel
UR3910430,2005-16-September,This was by far the worst place I have ever stayed. I received the smoking room when I asked for non-smoking so the room smelled horrible and they would not change my room. The walls had paint peeling and mold all over. The carpet was sticky and my sheets were not cleaned. When I asked for new sheets housekeeping came by and just dropped off a pile of new sheets and left. The bathroom was the worst mold and dirt everywhere. I had to cancel the rest of my stay there was no way I could spend another night in this pit. I would highly recommend to find another place.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR4026666,2005-16-October,I stayed at this hotel in October last year and didn't think at the time to write a review but having visited this web site now to see a review on a different hotel I felt compelled to add something about the Hotel Pennslyvania (or Hotel Translyvania as we lovingly referred to it whilst there!). Believe all of the other reviews you read about this hotel - it was AWFUL! There is no other word to describe it. However there is a positive side - if you want to see it! Despite arriving jet lagged to see a shabby lobby full of slightly lost looking grungey back-packer / hostel types loitering around and then getting up to the room which was a mix of everything everyone else in their reviews has described and then promptly feeling like we wanted to break down into hysterical sobs of tears we managed to recover and resign ourselves to the fact that it was only a 2* hotel which we had known all along and we got on with it. The positives are 1). its location - you really couldn't complain about that 2). it was room only so there was no need to eat there 3). it really was so awful that it made us want to stay out all day and night so we took in everything literally that NYC had to offer! By the end of our 5 night stay we were even kind of sad to leave the 'Translyvania' in an oddly macabre kind of way! It really is something out of the railroad era - and I found that quite fascinating - certainly looks like it hasn't been decorated since then! And check out all of the cupboards in the bedrooms - we had 5 - 3 of which led on from one another like a labyrinth plus a weird door which wouldn't open but which appeared to lead into the next room - Mad! However whilst we managed the trip on a budget (and the choice of hotel was all part of that plan) next time I go to NYC i'll definitely fork out the extra few dollars for somewhere a bit plusher! Good luck to the next trippers who go!,Roundaworldin86days
UR3476661,2005-16-May,What can I say ... except I wish I'd known about TripAdvisor before I booked for the Pennsylvania. Mind it was a bit naive to think it would be great just because Glenn Miller and his Orchestra stayed and played there - in all honesty ... that and the hotel location ARE the ONLY things going for it. I agree that the lobby was great but oh-so deceptive as when you got off the lift and onto the hallways ... well I thought I was in a different hotel. The stains on the carpets / walls / ceilings were v.scary and led me to wonder just what had been going on @ this hotel ... immediate visions of pimps & murderers sprang to mind ... and I'm not a paranoid person. It got worse tho ... the rooms ... UGH! Stains were NO better and the furniture was like someting out of a bad 70's porno ... call me old-fashioned but peeling filthy wallpaper just ain't my style. Anyway got the room changed which was marginally better (nice beige neutral tones as opposed to the grey / pink / splatter / strangely floral look of the previous room) ... some attempt @ rennovation had been made tho the square patch of "old" paint on the wall where the previous mirror had been was quite amusing. The bathroom was clean as were the beds but the carpets ... well I didn't care to look that closely after the 1st room. If I'd gotten this room in the first instance I probably wouldn't have minded so much ... even not being able to close the window wasn't so bad in the end. On my return to the UK - a conversation with a colleague led to the discovery that he had also stayed there years before ... we didn't need to say much about it the knowing glances said it all. So there you go ... not a lot being done by the hotel / management to improve the situation.,Bonnsoir
UR3276290,2005-16-March,We are not picky in anyway. This hotel is the most horrible thing we have ever seen. Homeless shelters are fancier and cleaner. Do not be fooled by the lobby or the exterior. The front desk hates working there and it is apparent in their customer service. It was so bad that we thought we were on some Candid Camera type show. We were waiting for the host of the TV show to surprise it with "We got you!",A TripAdvisor Member
UR3564178,2005-16-June,Would never stay here again in million years it remined me of a nursing home i use to work in and believe me that smelt nicer than this hotel the wallpaper was hanging off the carpets were all damp which after a few hours started to soak into my husbands suitcase the staff were not the friendliest of people took 3hrs to book in only allowed to cash $100 dollars a day in city that size i think that was a joke and not a very funny one at that wa came in one afternoon and the maid had been in to do the bed etc and found a pubic hair on the sink which just knocked us sick the hole place was dissgusting and if i were to go back to new york i wouldn't care about the location the place should be pulled down not renovated like they say they did five years ago more like 500 if you as me. pease if your thinking of staying here think again the city is a fantastic experience but he hotel is what i said in the begining it's the hotel from hell and believe me i would rather go to hell than ever stay there again,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3198332,2005-16-February,The staff at the front desk was rude. They yelled at a woman who was locked out of her room that she needed to "WAIT A SECOND!" I checked in and paid with a credit card (MISTAKE!) My room was on th 7th fl and unrenovated. My 10yr old and I went up there. The lobby is beautiful. They floors upstairs are NOT! The hallway was so dirty and had more stains than I had ever seen. There was a homeless woman sitting on the floor in the hallway. There were 2 large garbage bags of trash beside our door. The room was awful. Dirty old stained. I went downstairs and asked to leave. I was EXTRA nice and very polite. I just said "we dont wish to stay can we check out?"They refused to give me any proof that my credit card wouldnt be charged "TRUST ME" she said. I insisted to have some receipt because I know my credit card company would insist on it. Finally when I asked for a manager she printed out the check out form for me (took like 3 seconds) As for now the authorization ($50 OVER the room cost...which is customary but they didnt ask me first) is STILL on my credit card. It has only been 2 days but after a week I have to work hard to get it off. Let me state-I am NOT picky. I am easy to please great tipper REALLY polite. I wouldnt let my dog stay here. It was like something I have only seen on TV.,momof3atl
UR3778222,2005-16-August,To the person who wrote "This place is a dump" I wholeheartedly second that opinion. This was truly one of the worst places I have ever stayed in. Finding a cheap room in Manhattan is always a challenge so I decided to take a chance because the rate was so low. The fun started when I entered the smoky lobby (I guess they aren't abiding by the city's no-smoking laws). This hotel is popular with tour groups because of the low rates so the place was mobbed and the check-in line was very long. I waited at least 30 minutes. When I got to my room I was literally speechless from the shock. The bed had no headboard and was simply a box spring and mattress pushed against the wall. The room was tiny. Maybe I could have lived with both of those things. Then I noticed that the top drawer of the bureau was open and when I tried to close it it wouldn't budge; it was stuck and would not move in either direction. I opened the second drawer and there was dirt inside it--we are talking about half an inch of dirt as if someone had just poured it in. I am not exaggerating. I called the front desk told them the room was unacceptable and asked for another. First the front desk clerk said they were completely booked. I said that the bureau was not usable and that not all of the guests had arrived yet so surely she could find me another room. She grudgingly told me to come downstairs where I had to wait another half hour on line to change my room. This was one a bit better. There was no dirt in the bureau the drawer worked and the bed actually had a headboard. It was still tiny and would have been OK just for me but when my husband joined me in a few days it was pretty tight. Although the room wasn't outwardly dirty there was something about it that didn't give me a clean feeling; perhaps I was just still traumatized froom viewing the first room! I didn't have the time to try and find another hotel and I doubt I could have found one at that late date for a decent price so we just stuck it out and endured cigarette smoke every time we walked through the lobby. All in all - this place is a major dump and I would not advise anyone to stay there no matter how cheap the price.,ChelseaGirl98
UR3474166,2005-15-May,Although the lobby was crowded it was very grand and nice...just like the web site picture. This was when the horror began........after exiting the time machine (elevator) we felt like we were in the movie "The Shining"!!! The green glow from the hallways went well with the mold on the ceilings walls curtains bathroom floor and decorative sphere on the TV. The shower was reminicent of my elementary school camping years. The yellow stains on the sheets were also reminicent of my elementary school days!!! After immeadiately leaving to change our hotel room a housekeeper told us "we'd be better off asking for Section 8!!!" After Yen "upgraded" our room we received a larger version of the first; RIPPED CURTAINS WINDOWS WOULDN'T OPEN NO AC STAINED SHEETS DIRT CAMPING BATHROOM RIPPED CARPET. Needless to say two hours later we switched hotels for slightly more a night. Our experience would explain the crowded lobby with other hotel guests waiting to leave just like us.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3273947,2005-15-March,Booked on Hotels. I specifically booked a room type and also called to confirm and when I arrived did not get the room type. After ------ at the never friendly staff they upgraded me to a suite!. The suite had cracks in the walls stained furniture badly stained carpets as well as filthy windows. Rusty and dusty ac nosiy AC units... ah welcome back to NYC city! I paid $150 per night. Very cheap for NYC. Very large room though..... Will never go back or book a room on Hotels again.

UR4023977,2005-14-October,I have stayed at this hotel 3 times. Always for convenience. The first time was 5/02 for $79/night. The room was disgusting; however the convenience to MSG allowed us to forgive that. The second time we stayed there was 12/02. This time the hotel must not have been extremely busy because we were given a better quality room for $99/night. This summer we were charged $179/night for a standard room the size of a Cracker Jack Box. The condition and smell of the room were beyond description. We had to have the room deodorized. To learn that this hotel is charging $399 for this room this December makes my blood boil. NYC Government wake up and control the % of rate increases that your hotels charge for popular seasons! This does not help your tourism; and it should be unlawful for hotels to charge rates that far exceed the services and conditions rendered.,JanetCWyoming_RI
UR3273003,2005-14-March,Worst rooms i've ever seen - smelly dirty tub chipped and cracked. I did not want to touch anything. Hotel is extremely understaffed and the staff it does have is rude and unhelpful. We relocated to a Sheraton.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR4018655,2005-13-October,Arrived to the Hotel from Ireland . Lovely lobby marbled floors and clean.Very friendly and efficient staff at the desk. Got into the lift but when it opened on the 15th floor the wallpaper was falling off the walls paint was dirty and chipped  unfresh smell carpets dirty. The bedroom was the same. there was holes in the walls where the headboard of the bed used to be .The carpet was dirty and in particular hadnt been hoovered around the bed in some time. However the bathroom was clean the the sheets and towels were clean.We got another room on the 16th floor . This time slightly bigger but an unfresh smell. There was hole in the wall and the place needed a good clean  . I will not be going back there Patricia,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3897159,2005-12-September,Don't be deceived by this hotel's entrance and lobby which do look nice. Why? Because after check-in you will experience a gloomy walk through dingy hallways. And once you reach the room you will open the door to a world which is not very clean and is definitely outdated (especially the washrooms). Do yourself a favour and spend a little more to get a decent hotel room.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3546723,2005-12-June,My boyfriend and I had to queue at the reception desk for AGES when we first arrived. There was always lots of people in the lobby at whatever time of day we went through there but I suppose that was due to it being mid December and a busy period. LOTS of irate guests around! We had booked a 'superior' room rather than a standard. The woman on reception gave us our room key and we went up to find it when we opened the door we could not believe what we saw! DISGUSTING! constantly running tap in the bathroom filthy carpets TINY bed and it STUNK of smoke. Well we went straight back down to reception and started to queue again. But a porter spotted us and said 'oh you two complaining about your room? Come straight to the front of the queue - you don't have to queue twice.' So we saw the woman again and complained that the room was disgusting and demanded a better room. (on the way down in the lift we talked with another English couple who were on their way to say the same thing! Apparently its pretty common practice for them to put you in a crappy room first and wait to see if you complain.) So anyway woman on reception said 'booking a superior room doesn't guarantee you one. There are none available sorry.' So my boyfriend got very angry at this - at which point she glanced at the computer and an available superior room MIRACULOUSLY appeared to become available. She gave us these new keys and THAT room was a world apart. Huge queen size bed big TV clean. It was like a different hotel. The lesson to be learned from this experience - complain until they give you a satisfactory room! They give the nicest rooms to the ones willing to fight for them and believe me you do NOT want to see the horrendous state of their worst rooms. Be prepared for a lot of running up and down between rooms and reception desk - NOT the most relaxing start to your holiday after a long flight. Also I remember a school trip of girls staying in our corridoor running up and down and screaming all night long and leaving toilet roll scattered around outside. Having said all that the breakfast was yummy and it was handy for the subway - but not in my opinion a 'fantastic location.' VERY touristy area. There were other English people everywhere! The hotel is next to a real rip-off Sbarro! Quite difficult to find places to eat round here. Next time I'm staying in a hotel in Central Park West which gives more of a taste of the real New York away from tourist central.,Annoula
UR3661014,2005-12-July,We have a phrase in the UK - 'Fur coat and no knickers'. For those who dont understand it means flash on the outside with nothing to back it up on the inside. The foyer is very spacious and attractive the rooms an absolute disgrace. The 8th Floor was our unlucky abode. The room smelt of damp and NOTHING yes NOTHING! worked in the bathroom. The toilet didnt flush the plug in the sink didnt stay in until I wedged a paper cup in the system and there was no shower head or mechanism.Oh and the latch on the window was broken making it impossible to close (The man on reception claimed this was OK as it provided air conditioning!!!!!). We then failed to follow instructions and complained to reception who eventually agreed to move us. Our new room wasnt made up and closer inspection of the last occupants trash led us to believe it hadnt been cleaned for at least 4 days. The beds were unmade and wet towels littered the room. The staines on 2 of the chairs were not reassuring either. We chose this hotel because of its location and price. The Hotels summary advised that this hotel was ideal for those who wanted to spend their money on the delights of New York and not on accomodation. This phrase is an absolute 'cop out'. I do not expect much from a hotel as in my opinion you dont spend enough time in it to warrant a classy service  but this place is a shambles. To anyone thinking that my comments and others are overly harsh - trust me they are not - avoid this one like the plague!,A TripAdvisor Member
UR4235845,2005-12-December,I booked this hotel online. After showing up I checked out almost immediately and went to the Crowne Plaza. Hotel Pennsylvania is a complete dump and is a perfect candidate for gutting and remodelling.,MentalMan
UR3353798,2005-12-April,I keep seeing people talking about how cheap it is to stay here......."so they say get over the mold!" We stayed there less than 24 hours and were charged $374.60! I don't think that's BUDGET! Yes we checked out the next day......yes two different rooms......horrible smell......ceiling falling down........furniture that should be put out for the trash (if it was no one would pick it up it's not even fit to sell at a garage sale). Let me expain....no drawer handles broken legs the dresser tops were broken off. The sheets were so worn and rotten they were filled with holes. The pictures you see are real the stories you hear are true! The first time I talked to the desk clerk I was told............."These are the types of rooms hotels contracts for if you have a problem...call them." Hotels got me a different room......same quality. Since we were there for 10 days we found another hotel. Won't book on hotels again cost too much!Won't EVER go back to the Pennsylvania Hotel Central Park really is better! There might be nice rooms here but why chance it especially if you have your family with you? I really think the people who had nice rooms were real lucky or are employess and others who were paid to give this place a good rating! BEWARE!,A TripAdvisor Member
UR4106044,2005-11-November,I had the unfortunate experience of staying in this hotel for a group trip. They require you to stand on a long line to PURCHASE a ticket in order to store your luggage - definitely not the norm (even in NYC hotels). Then you have to take your luggage down to the basement on your own. Very inconvenient. Also while the lobby is nice the rooms are hideous. Tiny and dirty! There were scuff marks all over the walls. A colleague of mine had a used bar of soap in his shower. The sheets were scratchy. I could go on and on but to make it simple DO NOT STAY HERE!!,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3000146,2005-11-January,Went to New York 28th December 2004 The hotel when you book in looks fine but when you get to your room the shock hits you. Rooms are very small not cleaned very well at all and the bathroom was disgusting there were chips in the bath and it looked like it had been hand painted over there was no way we were going to take a bath in that. When complained we were moved. Yes the room was slighty better than the first but not what you would of expected at a cost of 600 for 4 nights stay. The best way to explain it was that of Butlins budget. If you can afford a little extra go for a better hotel. Okay its central for all the attractions but that is all. But besides that we had a great time in New York spent as little time in the hotel as possible.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR4232070,2005-11-December,Very important to warn people to book this hotel. Ive never been in such a terrble hotel. The rooms are dirty and cold.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3754638,2005-11-August,My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Pennsylvania during the first week in August and the room was what we expected from reading the reviews - an ok (I didn't say good) place to sleep in NYC for the location/price. The room wasn't nice by any means but we weren't planning on hanging out in the hotel all day so we figured it would serve it's purpose but we just wouldn't recommend it to our friends. That all changed on our 3rd night there when we came back from a day at Ellis Island to find my laptop and charger had been stolen from my case inside our locked room. Apparently this is a common problem at this hotel. Another couple had their wallet stolen the day before my laptop dissapeared. If you do chose to stay here please protect your belongings and don't leave anything in your (locked) room that you don't want the employees helping themselves to.,Cinful1
UR4003899,2005-10-October,I know it is some time ago but after some friends of mine went there recently and had a similar experience I had to write this report. I read that this is the Hotel that Glen Miller penned the song "Pennsylvania 6-5000" and that he played there with his band and I thought O.K the place has some historywell I don't think that the place has been decorated since the 1940's!! the room I had was not one of the renovated ones and in truth I did not push to get one I reasoned as I was only going to be in the hotel to sleep there it should be alright the bedding was clean however the carpet and drapes were filthy. As to the bathroom the shower head was coming off the walls as was the shower rail. the general state of the bathroom made me feel distinctly uncomfortable It really is a shame as the hotel is in a prime position directly across for Madison Square Garden two blocks from the Empire State and Macy's somone should get a hold of this place and spend some money on it at the moment is a a shabby low budget hotel I recently stayed at another hotel off Times Square paid about the same but was way ahead of this one I won't be back here and would not reccomend it to anyone,Allyone
UR3654085,2005-10-July,We have to say the first impression of the hotel The Lobby was big and busy. The staff especially the asian/indian man at the reception who checked us in and out was the rudest person ever!! We found the room very basic small old and the carpet was screaming out to be changed!! Our room was a Standard - Special nothing special about it! Halfway through the week we discovered a mouse in the room we asked to be moved and was given a smoking room! ( our first room was as requested no smoking). We moved to another room next level up it was nice but that was ruined by the room next door which had about 6 or 7 people talking very loudly till at least 2am! We had to call the reception to tell the people to tone it down we wanted to get up early to site see the people in the next room were staying at the hotel as there was a Convention being held there for Asians! If you are to stay there make sure there arent any conventions! The only good side is the location its 10 minute walk from Times Sqaure opposite Madison Sq Gardens and the Empire State Building isnt too far either. Also be aware - you are meant to tip the chambermaids every day or by the end of the week if you dont tip them they wont give you any extra's for the bathroom (not that we needed it). But they make you feel bad! How silly really when you have paid for the room you expect what you would expect in any hotel you stay in to have the bed tidied and bathroom kept clean with fresh towels! Be prepared to take extra $ for tipping purposes only...you'll need it!,A TripAdvisor Member
UR3176639,2005-10-February,Have just returned from New York City. I usually stay in the Red Roof Wolcott or Herald Square but was forced to locate in the Hotel Pennsylvania as it formed part of an organised trip. The lobby is fabulous -clearly this is where all the money has been spent as the room we had was in need of much care and attention. A stained ceiling - the victim of damp a TV which was broken on the first day and once repaired kept turning itself back on in the middle of the night a telephone which you couldn't use for outside calls and a smoke detector which looked disconnected. The whole place apart from the lobby and top floor all looked tatty and neglected. But the sheets were clean!,Mark Cartwright
UR3982634,2005-1-October,Stayed at the Pennsylvania Hotel for 4 nights in September 05. We decided to stay at this Hotel as we had stayed here 9 years ago and we liked the location. We were seeing a show at the Garden so it was convienient. When we stayed 9 years ago the room was not that bad. This time as soon as we walked in the room the smell of damp hit us it was horrible the bathroom had mould on the ceiling and the bath was chipped. The upside was the bed was very comfortable the shower was powerful and the iron and board and hairdryer was excellent. The air conditioning was also very good. The Hotel does have an excellent location but my advise would be to spend a little bit more money and stay at another Hotel in the same area.,bunnj
UR3103444,2005-1-February,Although we had a written confirmation for a superior room they gave us a small room with a small double bed and a at least 50 ! year old bath room with a shover. It was not even to be considered as "standard " After two telefon complaints we transferred to a bigger room with a heater which sounded like a truck engine and a carpet which seemed never been vacuum cleaned with thosands of stains. For the rate of 99 $ there are far better hotels in NY.,ddinc
UR2520155,2004-9-September,I live in NYC. my lady and I booked a night there beacuse we were traveling to Canada by train Penn Station which is right across the street. The room they gave us was not fit for a doberman. The hotel room was disgusting. I truly belive that they save the clean rooms for the upscale entertianers that visit NEWYORK. I could not wait to leave that hotel. AS A NATIVE NEW YORKER BEWARE IF YOU ARE NOT SOMEONE IMPORTANT DONT STAY THERE,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2670514,2004-9-October,My wife and son and I stayed in the Hotel Pennsylvania for one night on our way back from Spain in July 2004 having chosen the place because we were going to catch a train home early the next morning across the street at Penn Station--and with this hotel the earlier in the morning the better!. Our AAA travel agent had steered us away from the hotel the summer before based on its bad reputation (though we didn't realize just how bad its reputation was--and now we understand why it has it!) but the hotel we wanted to stay in this year was booked up so we took a chance on the Hotel Pennsylvania. We have stayed in various types of hostals and hotels around the world and this place was the worse and not just for the old and hideously dirty rooms (the letters "AC" hand-written on the wall above the AC switch pills on the floor stains everywhere in our first room; food under furniture and urine in the toilet in our second and supposedly improved room--my wife checked every possible inch for bed bugs) but also for its staff's "Hey this is what our hotel is like" attitude. They knew it was a dump and had heard so many complaints it seems from so many that it was no big deal to them. Several foreign tourists arrived while we were there and I was embarrassed frankly for the United States as well as sorry that these folks had spent good money to stay in this place during what was probably a package tour to New York! What a dump!,A TripAdvisor Member
UR1898866,2004-9-May,Having read the reviews I was concerned about staying at this hotel. In my room the carpet needed cleaning the windows were grimy and the curtains were stuck half way. There was a strip of peeling wallpaper above the bed and the lampshade was torn. However the bedding was clean the bathroom was fine with plenty of towels and the TV worked perfectly well. There was no problem with noise. I did have to wait for a while to get the safety deposit box every time. My advice would be: if you want nice surroundings pay a bit more and go elsewhere. If you're not bothered enjoy the great location with the whole of New York on your doorstep!,Freeflyer55
UR2873545,2004-9-December,We are just back from a short trip to New york where we stayed in the Hotel Pennsylvania. The hotel was OK but yes there were problems. If it's location you want this hotel is ideally located. Times square - 15 mins walk Subway across the road Macy's across the Road Bus station (to get to Woodbury Common) 15 mins walk and countless other places within easy stricking distance. Our plan was to get out and about as much as possible so we would not be spending much time in the our hotel room. We wanted a clean comfortable bed with clean sheets and we got that. But outside of the bed was a different story. The bathroom was not clean. Hairs on the floor bath sink - hairs everywhere. The bath / shower was dirty. The bathroom walls were dirty. The bedroom carpet looked like it had seen better days too. Neither of us would walk bare-foot in this room. Reception told us that this was one of the re-furbished rooms. (hmmmmm?) But don't forget we only wanted only somewhere clean to put our head down at night and we got that. Would I stay there again? I would. But only after packing my flip-flops and a bathroom cleaner.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2518332,2004-8-September,It served it's purpose. It was a place to sleep and shower. We did not spend much of our time in the hotel being that there is so much to do in NYC. The carpet is disgusting it was so bad that we didn't take our shoes off unless we were going to sleep or going to take a shower. The bathroom (luckily) wasn't that bad it seemed pretty clean. As for the doors they did looked coffins ~really strange~ !!My advice is spend just a little more money and stay in a decent hotel.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR1543204,2004-8-January,Went on a girly weekend to NYC and booked this hotel as part of a cheap internet deal. We were a bit disappointed on arrival that the rest of the hotel wasn't as nice as the lobby. 2 of us had to change our room immediately as the lights didn't work and the window was stuck open. We ended up a 5 minute walk (on the same floor) from our friends. Our rooms did look like they had been decorated in the seventies but they were fairly clean and one had a fridge the other had a fantastic view of the Empire State building. Anyway as we didn't plan to spend too much time here we got over our disappointment and relished in the fantastic location. Close to loads of top attractions and near the subway.,SuziR
UR1639427,2004-8-February,I have to say that Hotel Pennsylvania is the absolute worst hotel that I have ever stayed in in my life. The pictures on their website were completely misleading. They might actually have one guest room that looks like the one in the picture but I'm pretty sure that most rooms there are not that nice. The rooms look like they haven't had any kind of renovations since the 60s. Our room was incredibly small the carpet had stains on it the walls needed painting there was a hole in the wall where the cable was coming into the room and the shower was so gross that I refused to use it in the 2 days we were there. My husband and I tried to stay out as late as possible so that we wouldn't have to spend much time in our room. I wish I had found these reviews before we stayed there because I'm sure we would have booked another hotel even if it meant spending more money. If you are interested in staying near the action (Times Square etc) this is definately not the place to stay (unless you don't mind walking.) Do not waste your money here.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR1541366,2004-7-January,We stayed here for 3 nights while Christmas shopping in December 2003. I had read the reviews so I was prepared for the horrors to be found at this hotel. I wasn't disappointed! The room we were first given looked like a slum. There were two tiny beds no curtains dirty linen and the room was miniscule even by English standards. After complaining to the reception staff we were given a much better room. It was still shabby and I wouldn't walk on the carpet without slippers or shoes but the bathroom and towels were clean as was the bed linen. Good value and great location but next time I will spend more money and stay at a nicer hotel.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2869301,2004-7-December,We stayed at the Pennsylvania from Nov 12th to 16th the lobby was a very grand affair with marble floors and crystal chandeliers we were told the staff were unfriendly but found them to be quite freindly and helpful. We then arrived in the rooms and oh deary me what a shock. Plaster was falling from the ceiling and the place had not been decorated for years and years the painted walls were dirty and the carpet was sticky. 2minutes later our friends came to tell us they were not stopping in their room after a quick inspection of their room we could see why it made ours look positively opulent with a stale mildewy type smell so we went to reception with them and joined the queue to complain which was quite lengthy they were then given another room which still quite discusting was better than the first. I would not stay in the hotel again rent free though in its favour the location is first class.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2428032,2004-7-August,Although we have stayed in "cheap" hotels and hostels around the world this takes the cake for the worst mistake any traveler could make-- this is the WORST MOST HORRIFIC place we could have selected for our 5 nights in NYC. After a 30 minute wait to check in we almost cried when we walked in to our room--the carpet was damp and stained and the smell was worse than a fraternity house on a Sunday morning. After complaining we received another room which had paint literally peeling in chunks from the ceiling another damp and stained carpet mold growing in the corners and curtains that could have been used to sweep 7th Ave. And no smoke detector. The shower with the spigot at about 4 feet high didn't drain forcing us to re-wash our feet after getting out--with shoes close by b/c there was no way you'd want to touch the floor w/bare feet. After trying to sleep on the top of the tiny bed (too gross to even consider looking under the covers) we checked out early the next am and found another place (actually a palace!) for not too much more...we booked w/ Hotels and I am just starting the fight to get reimbursed for the 4 nights we booked but didn't use--I took pictures of the filth to support my claims because no one in the hotel industry would believe what this place is trying to pull off as acceptable accommodations ...the staff was very nice I must say--but if the front desk people had any idea of the quality of the rooms they were assigning they would be ashamed to work there. The lobby is deceiving--it is nice. This teaches me to ask to see a room before I sign anything--and I will never use Hotels again either. My hope is that some news media have reservations there for the upcoming Repub. Convention across the street at MSG and are as disgusted as we were and decide to do a story on it. The place needs to be condemned.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2622632,2004-6-October,the room allocated can only be described as derelict as were the other 5 rooms we were offered.the staff couldnt care less and just shrugged.i am surprised the New York Tourist people dont close this place down its got to be a health hazard.now looking at the other reviews i cannot understand why the management/owners dont do something to the place  i guess they have your money and care a hoot whether you stay again  why should they there'll be another poor sucker along in a minute.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2809998,2004-6-November,Ive just got back from manhattan and apart from the hotel i had a great time. On checking in we were given a room on the 16th floor. Before i could turn and pick up our bags on getting our room key there were 2 couples waiting to complain one wife was crying about their room. On opening our room door the smell hit us like old smoke and mould there was a telly sitting on a box in the middle of the room the bedding was grey with age and the carpet was badly stained. We went back down to the lobby with our bags and met one of the couples who told us they were given a new room on the 9th floor and it seemed ok so i went and asked for the manager and told her we wanted a clean room one that didnt smell she told us that we got what we paid for and then i said i wanted our money back. We ended up on the 9th floor and the room was alot better but if you dont fight for it you wont get it. Also dont use the stairs from the 2nd floor down we found needles and the smell of **** and **** was unreal. Its best to take a lift down. I met a lad from kerry who said he was offered 3 rooms the second one had **** on a wall. I know its only a 2 star and its in mid-town manhattan. But we are human!,A TripAdvisor Member
UR1540246,2004-6-January,booked a 5 day new year break at this excuse for a hotelthat was my first mistake.Arrived to a 1hour queue at reception to be given a twin room after booking a double then after half an hour complaining being given a room out of trainspotting.more complaining i at last got a 5th rate 1940s the room that time forgothovel.the reception area was gorgeous shame i couldnt of slept here.the adjoining resturant was superb(Ojays)but those rooms are so dirty that i didnt dare think what half the stains were.so my advice is pay a bit more and do some research.,NottinghamSwimmer
UR2865091,2004-6-December,Party of 8 (four 2X room reservations) arrived Nov 04 early afternoon in a wonderfully ornate lobby thinking hey this is the place for us. We merrily proceeded to our rooms once given the keys. This is where the use of such words as wonderful and merry come to a sobering end. If NY is the city that never sleeps then this is the hotel there that never sweeps. The dirty trashed walls and musty damp smell that graced the 7th floor corridor was just a pointer of things to come. All four of our rooms (on different floors) were absolutely disgusting. Dark dingy filthy wallpaper creeping off the walls flood damage stains mould growing in the bathroom .. I could go on and on. You would need an electric sander to clean the antique grime off the windows. Went immediately back to lobby and joined the hordes complaining to completely disinterested rooms manager to be told that all rooms are like that. A lie because I had already asked opinion of a room cleaner who said some rooms were renovated and that ours was not. Not getting anywhere we lost the first day of our vacation seeking clean accommodation eventually upping sticks to the Milton Plaza without opening our suitcases. It was as bad as that. Horrendous.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2425256,2004-6-August,As far as location goes it was undeniably the best. It was close to all tourist attractions and based on that alone I would definately stay again. However the rooms were absolutely disgusting. My friend had left with these strange swollen bitemarks we deduced were bedbugs!! The room stank it had a moldy dampness to it the room was cramped and the previous people who stayed left their foodstuffs in the mini-fridge! Obviously the maids forgot to clean that out. One room was found with cockroaches!! I think with all the business the Hotel is getting they could afford to clean-up and make some upgrades to the rooms. The staff could've been more friendly too. I hope whoever stays has a more pleasant experience.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2620566,2004-5-October,Like many before I was dreading staying at this hotel as there were 7 of us and it was a birthday surprise for my brother. Out of the 4 rooms we had only my room required changing due to a dirty white blind instead of curtains rust in the bath tub no shower curtain and very dubious brown stains just above the pillows (no headboard). We managed to get our room changed by a receptionist well versed in complaints (we were only half way through our list when we were given our new room key) and although the room was smaller it was clean. The lobby is beautiful and the location could not be faulted. Stay here if it is dirt cheap but my previous stay in the New yorker was far preferable and in a similar central location,zoobie
UR2807318,2004-5-November,Look up 'funky' and there should be a picture of this place... Old old old everything - my room looked like a set from CSI Manhattan- all that was missing was the chalk outline. It took 4 calls and 25 minutes just to get the phone turned on. Two stars is gracious in the extreme- keep looking is my advice.,Lockjaw43
UR2863626,2004-5-December,When we arrived at the hotel we were really impressed by the lovely reception. There was a group of 7 of us with 3 rooms booked. When we were all issued with our room keys we were all on different floors! When I got out the lift at the 7th floor the smell of mould & oldness hit me. I was dreading going into the my room (thank god i wasn't there on my own - the room was along a dark smelly corridor). The room was an absolute discrace the window wouldnt close right there was mould all over the walls the carpet was all stained the toilet leaked when it was flushed the bedside cabinet didn't have any drawers there was cables hanging from everywhere and the sockets weren't even attached to the wall! The rest of the groups rooms weren't much better either. When we went to complain there was already 3 different groups of people complaining. When we complained and advised that our room was on the 7th floor a member of staff said that that is one of the worst floors in the hotel and should be shut down! We all managed to get new rooms and they were much better - I couldnt beleive it was the same hotel. When we were speaking to people that live in New York and told them where we were staying there - their faces said it all.,holidaymaker83
UR1628195,2004-4-February,as soon as you walk in you feel special big chandelier big lobby big reception...............big queue. we were given door passes that didnt work/also allocated a room that was occupied. The corridors are long and the doors to the rooms look like massive security doors very scary. The room was smelly (dampness) need a lick of paint. We wouldnt stay here ever again. New York however is fantastic love it love it love it.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR1763512,2004-4-April,Me and my friends where pleased to see a nice hotel lobby and reception  when we had checked in and got in the lifts to go to our bedroom when the lift doors opened to our floor level we where met by the smell of damp and rott. We then got to the room which was what i would call a dump with net curtains stained with dirt and was black in colour also dirty curtains bedding look ok i suppose but did not intend to sleep in the bed in fear of being bitten. also the floor was never hooverd while we there we also noticed sick which had dried along the corridor carpets the furniture looked dated and dirty also we had some youths trying to let themselfs into our room on one accasion also when we so the room attendants there trolleys where empty god knows whats goes on at this hotel but they should be closed down to health and hygine  the best laugh was the carpet that never fit to the sides of the room and had spikes showing around the edges . what more can i say apart from its a health risk to anyone staying there. Enter the hotel at your own risk is what i would say. me and my freinds stayed there march 25th 2004 and never again.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR1622380,2004-31-January,Stayed for 5 nights in December 2003. Our room looked like it had never been cleaned stained walls carpets etc or changed its decor since 60s/70s. Bathroom was very nice and clean though with a good supply of hot water all the time. Dingy corridors with vile green carpets with loads of heavily bolted bedroom doors reminiscent of being in a crypt. Very unfriendly with long queues to speak to anyone on reception at all times. Quite souless. However it suited our needs close to amenities a bed to sleep in and a good TV. However our stay was summed up when on informing a member of staff on reception that our room was pretty crap he replied yes all the rooms are!,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2609908,2004-30-September,I had to make a last minute trip to NYC when the UN General Assembly was in session and every hotel was booked but the Hotel Pennsylvania. I paid $219.95/night plus tax for a room that looked like it was in a flop house. I've stayed in all forms of accomodations around the world including youth hostelspensions and various motels and none were as dirty or in poor condition as the room I got at the Hotel Pennsylvania. The service at the hotel is equal to the conditions of the facilities with the front desk being unhelpful and rude. This has truly got to be one of the worst hotels in NYC. If you can avoid it stay away.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR1755950,2004-30-March,The location of this hotel is Great!!! Is a shame that their costumer service is so terrible. There was a mistake with the date of my reservation and all the MANAGER could say was "Call the people you made your reservation with. Next person on line.!!! He didn't even bother to offer a room or any other solution if I had been closer to home I would have come back and not stay there.The room was clean but because it was a last-minute-reservation we got a 10" wide window room with a view to the other three walls of the back of the hotel. Lobby is impressive halls on upper rooms are horrible and old. Only because is cheap and has a good location can be useful. Don't expect anything nice.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2231326,2004-30-June,We stayed at hotel Pennsylvania for 3 nights...Don't let the fancy lobby or snazzy internet photos fool you.. This is an awful place..Our room was tiny and dirty and they had forgotten to leave towels for us on the second night and it took over an hour to bring them to our room despite us wondering if they got lost on the way up...The ONLY PLUS is its location...right near everything...but it was a hard earned lesson..What a dump! Stay away....,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2346478,2004-30-July,Hell and yes it did include coffins. The doors of your room actually look like a coffin cover. After 30 minute check in I proceeded to my room. Upon entering I noticed women's clothes on the floor but at least I was greeted by two nice small dogs looking at me and bouncing on the bed!! Back downstairs for another room. Ok nobody in this room but the mold in the bathroom. Leaving to go to dinner I was greeted by yet another small dog running around the 9th floor hallway. Back from dinner and too afraid to stay in my room I wander to the bar for a night cap. Nice bar. They were even nice to the undercover stripper trying to pick up Johns. Back to the room. I didn't even want to pull the sheets off the bed but I did venture to use the pillows. 1:30 falling asleep. Wide awake at 6:15 to get the hell out of there. I had to wait until 7:30 to leave though cause it takes an hour to retrieve your $35.00 valet parked car - which of course didn't come fast enough as I then had the pleasure of seeing a transvestite coming out of the hotel. I thought someone told me there was no room service at this hotel? I'd rather stay under Madison Square Garden than here.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2964659,2004-30-December,Stayed there in August 2004. Great location in midtown but that's all. Terrible queues at reception reception staff with minimal English and who were extremely unhelpful. To cap it all after I checked in and underlined I was staying for three nights I returned on day 2 to find myself having been automatically checked out of my room - and (after another long queue at reception) the guy who'd checked me in denied having had any conversation with me. Really really poor hotel.,KennyMacD
UR1849149,2004-30-April,I stayed here in October 2003 and was shocked by how grimy the place was. The room was TINY the walls were dirty and there was no clock. When I was ready to sleep I turned the TV off and heard SCURRYING so I turned it back on in fear. I was NOT impressed. If you're really trying to save money sure stay here. Otherwise avoid it!,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2804573,2004-3-November,My best friend and I booked 2 nights recently at the hotel Pennsylvania. We were looking forward to our stay in the city. We arrived to the hotel and our first impression of the lobby and shop area was that it was "nice". As we proceeded to the elevators getting off at our floor and walking to our room it just got worse. We entered the room and all we could do was laugh at initial shock. The carpet was stained the lamp shades were torn and discolored I found an empty soda bottle under the bed the dresser was missing a drawer handle the bathroom sink had a minor leak the mini fridge was lop-sided and worse of all there was NO A/C. I contacted the front desk to be informed that after the summer the air conditioning is turned off. (the outside temp during our stay was low 60's) We were roughly 18 stories high in a tiny room with no AC or air vents. I was exremeley disappointed with the appearance of this hotel considering the rates they charge and how close to times square and other attractions it was too. I would think the hotel mgt. would want to make rennovationd or even just pay to clean the rugs to make a good impression on guests - So they would want to come back.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2607190,2004-29-September,The pennsylvania Hotelwhere do I start This hotel looks very exciting when you arrive in the lobby and you think you have cracked it when you see it but wait until you are allocated your room we got a room on the 7th floor(775) and it was disgusting the curtains were hanging off the toilet was dirty the whole room was dirtystains on carpetslight switches hanging off broken etc the room was cold the air condition did not workwe complained and the staff at reception did not care until we asked for someone higher upwe got someone and he could not change our room until the next day and he said himself he would not stay at this hotel unless he got rooms on the 11th or 12th floor which had been re-conductiond to a higher standardthat was the assistant manager.If you get this hotel tell your travel agent to get somewhere elseDO NOT STAY HEREI am not telling you a lieDO NOT GO HERE,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2852774,2004-29-November,The hotel is in a great location but this is the only redeeming feature to this hotel. We did have clean sheets ( i had taken my own after reading the reviews on here...) but everything else in the room was dirty past its user date and in need of a good scrub! Friends of ours stayed on a lower floor and it was in a much better state than our floor...the wall paper was falling off the curtains did not close as the rail was broken the smoke alarm was bleeping (we called the guy to fix it and as he could not reach he asked my husband to climb up and change the battery as he was taller....amused us for hours!) the bathroom shelf was not hinged down the arm chair was worm away and filthy etc etc... We only had a night and were able to laugh about it...if I had been staying any longer i would have have asked to be moved but hey we were only in the room for sleeping! Be warned!,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2329543,2004-29-July,Last May i was in NY for 6 days I read all the reviews after making the reservation and I was scared. I got a room on the 13th floor it's an old floor the walls looked awful damaged some doors too. The room was nothing special it was clean. I don't have any complain to make about the room it wasn't very nice (old) everyday was cleaned and they put fresh towels and sheets. I haven't seen any bugs but it's possible they exist.... don't forget it's a very OLD building. I only needed a clean place to sleep and take a bath i had a great view and NY to enjoy.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2227433,2004-28-June,Awesome area but god awful rooms! We got a room that was to be for 4 people the 2 beds were smaller than twin bed barely fitting one person let alone 2 in each bed! Rooms extremely small and overall unpleasant stay.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2326269,2004-28-July,First off let me just say yes the lobby is nice. And that is the last nice thing I will say about this dump. We stayed in this hotel in March and I still am questioning why the heck I paid to stay here. It took an hour to check in for one and that should have told us something. We proceed to the elevator. Oooooh tv's. Boy am I excited. The elevator doors open to our floor and all of our mouths drop immediately. The stench of that place hit us and we immediately closed our mouths for fear we might catch some airborne disease. We slowly walk down the dim hallway and pray that our room is better. We notice the doors on all the rooms look like...no that can't be right. Yep. Coffins! What the he....We open our door and are welcomed to peeling wallpaper nasty furniture dirty carpet murky water dripping from the faucet a horrible stench an unsanitary bathroom no towels a broken lamp crummy curtains grimy windows noise from next door and dust for days. We are scared to put our bags down for fear we might take some kind of exotic breed of roach back home. I'm telling you that place was so crappy I was scared to pull my pants down to use the bathroom! We attempted to exchange our room and guess what we found in our new room? We walked in on people undressing! There were people in our new room. How do you give someone an occupied room!? How bad is that!? We go BACK down to the lobby and ended up with the same dump for a room. I slept in the chair because I was scared of what I might find when I pulled the sheets back off the bed. I also showered with my slippers on for fear of falling and actually having to touch that grimy tub. Not to mention the water pressure was so freaking high in the shower I truly believe I lost a layer of skin. If I was smart I would have caused some commotion got arrested and ended up in jail because I bet money the jail would have been more updated and cleaner. It's that freaking bad! DONT STAY AT THIS RAT HOLE! Matter of fact rats won't even stay here.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR1617657,2004-28-January,I only stayed here because of work - it was the show hotel recommended through an expo at Javitz - and had problems with reservations and billing before I even arrived. Upon checking into my non-smoking room on a non-smoking hall which smelled like smoke I knew that the problems would continue. Unlike most good hotels the HP won't let you handle ssues from your room but instead require you to come down to the lobby where the lines are long beyond belief. The room was dingy and dark but just clean enough to pass. My room continued to smell like smoke despite opening the window all day when I was out (this is in sub-zero temperatures outside) and I finally realized it was coming from down the hall - from a room apparently occupied by human smokestacks - and it was coming in under the 1 inch gap under my door. I finally had to resort to the bath mat rolled up and put across the door to keep the smoke out. Security did not care enough to respond do my call about smoking on a non-smoking hall. I am allergic and the only reason I didn't request to change rooms is that I was scared I would get one that was worse. I repeatedly had problems with the phone receiving messages and getting calls from outside. The day before I checked out - when I was convinced this hotel experience could not get any worse - the pipes burst water leaked all over the lobby and put the elevators out of commission so guests were forced to use the service elevators. Although they were left to largely figure this out themselves as signs were not put up and it was difficult to find the service elevators once in the halls (which by the way are painted government issue gray and the doors literally look like coffin covers). The icing on the cake compelling me to write this review is that the hotel triple charged me on my credit card and I cannot get through to anyone in accounting and they are not returning my calls. Beware!,A TripAdvisor Member
UR1844259,2004-28-April,Stayed in December 2003. After two nights at New York Helmsley (Excellent) coming to stay here was a bitter disappointment. Check in took over half hour but it is a large hotel. We had a renovated room with mould in the corners carpet not fit to walk on and only just big enough to fit the bed in. Never again.,Wildpoppy
UR2789508,2004-27-October,Our first time to New York and was so excited about the whole event. The Pennsylvania hotel was disgusting. When we arrived we thought we had made a great choice by the sight of the hotel lobby but once out of the elevator onto the 9th floor..........shock. The corridors had a musky smell. Our room was drab dull and filthy. My sisters room was even worse mould on ceiling plaster falling off walls cobwebs and the wardrobe was a cubbie hole with hooks along the back wall and she had flea bites on her face and neck the following first morning. We hated every minute of it. We had to get on with it and only used the room as a base. Someone told us they had better rooms on other floors but the few floors we seen were no different. Staff told us most of the hotel had been renovated 2 years ago........dont know what part. Dont be taken for a fool like us. DONT STAY!!,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2224962,2004-27-June,I stayed at this hotel with 3friends on 31st May for 3nights.NEVERNEVER AGAIN. The staff on reception were rude when we tried to make a complaint to the manager we had to speak to him by phonewould not come out to see us. The room was a disgrace dirty windowsfilthy carpet thank goodness I had taken slippers behind the unit with the TV on I doubt if it had ever seen a hoover in years. The ceiling in the hallway on our floor started to fall down and it was left there on the dirty hall carpet. At least there were clean bed linen and towels. A good location but this hotel definately needs money spent on it big time their reception staff need training in customer relations.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR1674835,2004-27-February,This hotel is possibly the worst i have erer stayed in. we had to change rooms three times floor was filfthy rusty fittings in the bathroom paper falling off the walls damp need i go on??? JUST DONT EVER STAY HERE!!!!,A TripAdvisor Member
UR1843380,2004-27-April,This was absolutely the worst hotel I have ever stayed at. It looked all nice in the lobby until I got to my room and found tons of random hair all over my bed and pillow cases. Sound bizarre? It was the sickest thing I have ever encountered. DONT STAY HERE if you're looking for a clean hotel.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR1746741,2004-26-March,You're on holiday and you expect to get a friendly welcome from the staff but this did not happen! The exterior of the hotel and the ground floor reception area is impressive. This hotel is in a great location too. However the decor of the room was terrible (holes in the wall and grubby curtains that did not close). The services menu on the televison did not work and neither did the internet access. The queen bed was massive though and at least the room and bathroom was clean. Good hotel if you're on a budget.,sunluvva
UR2847130,2004-25-November,The only positive of this hotel is the location you really could not ask for better. Arrived at the hotel after a long day travelling from a trip to las Vegas. Long long wait to book in. Finally given a room openend the door to be faced with what looked like a prison cell it was so small. The bathroom was filthy paint coming off the walls the shower tray peeling and worst of all the room was still dirty from the previous user. Filthy sheets rubbish bins full to over flowing. Why were we given a filthy dirty room? It was quite late in the day and not early morning soon after the previous occupant had left. We immediately returned downstairs and refused to stay in the room and asked for another. The sad thing was that the person who booked us in was not suprised to see us back at all it seemed as though this was quite normal to him. We were given a much better room although I did get bitten by some insect living in the room...5 times infact. I have since been on the hotel web site and they only show rooms that look good and certainly not what we were given which to me is false representation. I don't think in the 3 days we stayed there did I meet anyone who was happy with the hotel. The main cause of complaint was the rooms and how dirty they were. 2 couples were even moved to different hotels as the ceiling to their rooms was falling down!!!! I have stayed in Travel Lodges in the US at a fraction of the price we paid and the rooms have been considerably better.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2221642,2004-25-June,If I had arrived here earlier in the day I would have left and found another hotel. The room I was given was incredibly shabby. The carpet and wallpaper were stained the door looked like it had suffered water damage the window shade wouldn't close the air conditioner was broken the lamp wouldn't stay upright on the wall there were stains on the bathroom walls and the leg of the basin in the bathroom had fallen off and was on the floor. A very unpleasant place to stay at any price.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR1668693,2004-25-February,Where do I start how about the lines moving to slowly the mice crawling through the walls the mold on the ceiling in the bedroom(s) I moved twice the bathroom ceiling cracking or the dust balls going through the lobby like tumble weeds at the OK Corral. The see through towels or the dust balls again under the furniture. The corrridor walls cracking down and the carpet looks like it is from WWII era. I have stayed there before about a year ago and it was okay at least it was clean then. Security was curt and the front desk was miserable at best Housekeeping was run much better when I was there back in 02. What ever was going on then do it again. Until then I wouldn't go back and this from a native New Yorker. Shame on The Hotel Pennsylvania some should call the news show Help Me Howard to get this place closed down!,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2944561,2004-25-December,Our room was very bad and we learned through the desk clerk that our booking through hotels was part of a block that did not include the rennovated rooms. The website for hotels gives the impression you will get a rennovated room. The hotel clerk told us that because we booked through hotels we could not upgrade to a rennovated room. Our room on the 13th floor was bad: wet carpet mold in corners curtain broken wallpaper peeling pictures off the hooks grimy. The closet was not clean. It took the strength of two people on a chair and the window sill to close the window and apply the one window lock that was working (the other was broken). The shade was broken. The hallways had the appearance of a slop house and dangerous. The fire alarm went off at 11:00 PM. I called the desk clerk to ask what we should do. He said the person in charge of the system was working on it and we should stay in our room. The alarm rang on and off for another ten minutes and it was loud. Because the look of the place made it feel very dangerous and we had just arrived that night I finally called 911 directly. This did not make for a restful night. We paid a lot for this room. When we checked in I noticed on the side of the desk clerk's printer the taxes listed for the different-priced rooms. None were as expensive as what we paid through hotels.com When I asked the desk clerk if we paid too much they said that we should book directly next time. The lobby staff elevators clientele and location are fine. The bathroom was fine.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2598514,2004-24-September,We were traveling to New York for a business trip. It was close to the convention center and a reasonable price. Once there the nightmare began. There was mold and mildew on the wall. The bathroom door wouldn't close. The bottom frame of the bathroom door was rotted out. The sink was missing a leg. The shower curtain was missing half it's hooks and the floor got flooded at times. There were two people in the room and the maid service left only one face cloth. We requested additional towels and they took them when they cleaned the room. The hallway carpets were disgusting. We tried to change rooms but were told the other rooms were worse...WORSE! Management wouldn't even talk to us. I would NEVER stay or recommend this hotel to anyone. Buyer beware! If it sounds to good to be true it usually is.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2844662,2004-24-November,My stay at the Hotel Pennsylvania was horrible. It took 40 minutes to check in and upon finally arriving in my room I found it to be completely run down. Paint was chipping off all of the walls the carpet was stained everywhere and plaster fell off the ceiling all night long on to all of my things. As if that wasn't enough I woke up at 2:00 am to the sound of someone opening the door to my room. The front desk had given a key to my room to a complete stranger. Their only response was to this incident was to tell me I shouldn't be concerned because it was a nice person.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2483161,2004-23-August,My mom sis and grandma stayed at this...hotel...for one night in August 2003. Whoever said the beauty of the lobby fooled you was 100 percent right. I thought I had walked into the Four Seasons! But that's where this comparison ends...I was immediately turned off by the hallways and noticed that the doors of the rooms looked quite unusual lol...Thankfully my half of the family was staying at the Crowne Plaza UN so I didn't have to sleep in this room and although I didn't notice anything horrid in the room (other than the dated look of the room and furniture) I took a peek in the bathroom...and well let's just say it wasn't pretty. One of the un-pretty things I found were nail clippings! Nail clippings! Jeez makes you wonder what use is housekeeping at this hotel?,nyckid99
UR2314626,2004-22-July,OH MY GOD WHAT A DUMP! i stayed here May 18th-20th 2004.The hotel lobby was nice and check-in took about 20 minsour room was booked direct with the hotel on their web-site and i requested the nicest possible room as it was my girlfriends first trip to the states and the upgrade was confirmed at check-in.God what must the other rooms have been like? where do i start? once leaving the elevator the smell hit you and the decor of the walkway to our room was dated to say the leastour room was dark & depressing and smelt of tobaccothe bathroom was cramped dirty and with the shower base peeling. when we each took showers the water pressure pinned us against the walland when we had finished showering we needed to check that one or two of our body parts were still there.on the first morning we decided to take breakfast in one of the two hotel restaurants which cost over $50 and was at best average considering the waitress looked like robert de-niro in drag with an attitude to match (the tip was already included in the bill) i wonder why that was?. On the plus side the hotel was across the street from penn station which was handy as we travelled on the Amtrak at 7.15am and was close to Macy's and the Empire State Building,yorkiespurs
UR1664422,2004-22-February,We went to the penn for the Creation Farscape con in 2001 and oh my god what a pain in the butt. We get there and the lobby is packed because in adition to our con there was a Star Trek con and a Micheal Jackson concert. So you have all these people and only five chairs on the side of the lobby. So I park my butt on the floor with some of my friends who managed to grab the seats and start doing my homework while I wait for my sister to get through the endless line to the desk. I wasn't in anyone's way I made myself as small as possible and yet I got harangued by some over glorified bell boy who told me I couldn't be sitting on the floor. After an hour we finally get our keys two of them even though there are three of us. After much nagging we get a third key but they deactivated the other time for whatever inane reason they had. We didn't realize this at first of course it was after my sister and her husband went back to the room after a party and couldn't get in. When they went down to the desk complain they gave my sister a hard time cause she wasn't wearing her shoes which were of course in the locked room. The room itself which was supposed to be a triple but was instead a double wasn't all that bad just horribly stuffy especially the bathroom. Our friend was less lucky as she got a room with the door coming off the hinges. The con was on the top floor in a large auditorium with atrocious acoustics so the people in the back couldn't hear anything that was being said. The closest bathrooms were on the sixth floor even for the people backstage. The sad thing is after reading all these reviews I realize how lucky we were. Avoid this hotel it's not worth any amount of money you save.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2910575,2004-22-December,I booked this hotel thru the internet from Ireland my husband said he heard bad reports from it and I said that it couldnt be that bad how wrong I was. We checked in on the 21 december x 1 night were going to a show in manhattan. When we got off the lift on the ninth floor I knew there was something wrong..... it was dark and dirty and the carpet looked like it had not seen a vaccum for quite some time... When we went to our room 935 I could not believe my eyes the bathroom was filthy leaking water from I dont know where hair in the bath the sink and the walls. The bath tub was chipped and had a ring around it and the taps were dripping constantly. The bedroom was quite frightening. The walls were filthy chipped paint and the carpet was dirty and had a layer of dust on it. I was afraid to look at the bed. The curtains were dirty and the windows were filthy. We went to our show but just went back to the hotel to pack and leave at 1am. This hotel sould not be allowed to offer what it does just on the basis of its central location. We deserve more. It should be shut down and totally ripped out.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2838077,2004-21-November,This hotel was horrible. Check in took 45 minutes as did check out when they incorrectly charged us. Had booked non-smoking on non-smoking floor guess what room smelled so strongly of smoke we had to ask for another room. Finally got moved to a different room where we could hear every word our neighbour spoke on the phone due to paper thin walls and adjoining door. They decided that it was time to turn off the heat on our second day in the entire hotel and even though it was still cold enough for winter coats outside. I complained they told me that the law permitted them to let us freeze and didn't even offer extra blankets which I would have been afraid to use due to unidentified stains. After all the problems I had they had the nerve to try to charge me to keep my bags in a lockup for half a day. When I complained they finally waived the stupid $5 fee. All-in -all a horrible experience smelly rooms and floor and oh yeah the lobby bathroom and the bathroom at the entrance to the so-called health club (which was locked and I couldn't get a key to) was over-flowing into the hallway. Yuk. Pay the staff an extra dollar an hour and maybe they would actually clean and check people in!,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2084937,2004-20-May,We arrived at the Pennsylvania Hotel after a very long journey from England hoping to find the friendly Americans which we had been told about. Instead we had to queue up at Reception for approximately 10 minutes and were greeted by a very unfriendly receptionist. We asked if any renovated rooms were available and were ignored. On asking again we were more or less shouted at that there were none available! Two members of our party were then told that they had no reservations and to "wait there". We waited for approximately 45 minutes before a "manager" came out and told us to calm down even though we hadn't said anything. I tried to talk to her but was talked over all the time and she wouldn't let me speak! She then said she wouldn't talk to me anymore and walked off! We were treated as if we were totally at fault no apologies at all. I agree with the other comments about the standard of the rooms - damp smell dirty windows badly in need of a good clean and paint. We tried to change rooms but none were available. I definitely would not recommend this hotel to anyone and was very disappointed as this was my first visit to the USA.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2208030,2004-20-June,Stayed one night at this hotel 6/5 and was shocked by the poor upkeep of their standard room. Had a faulty shower in the bathroom which housekeeping could not address immediately.. they needed a day or two to get their plumber in!! Room was dusty and musty- did not appear at all like the internet version; bedsheets pillowcases towels didn't look clean appeared very used with some stains. Thank goodness we only had a night's stay here before heading to Boston the next day... on our return trip to NYC we stayed at a much better hotel- The Bedford. This may be one of the larger & older NY hotels but you would expect a certain standard of upkeep & cleanliness of their rooms.,gnom:o)
UR2311078,2004-20-July,Stayed here in December '04. Pictures on web site looked very nice. Lobby lived up to pictures but rooms were appalling. We arrived to find they only had one room reserved for 5 adults despite having paperwork showing 2 rooms! Out of lift into hallway - terrible dirty carpets and hiddeous doors. One room had dirty towels and rubbish left by previous occupant walls were full of holes from where picture have been hung and paper was hanging off the walls. The other room smelt of damp and smoke and the curtain was hanging from the window. We joined the huge queue of others complaining and were eventually given another room still smoky but down as a none smoking room. Complained again and were moved a 3rd time this room was still sub standard but we were only there 3 nights and didn't want to spend all our time in lobby with unhelpful staff complaining. Others we spoke to found bed linen dirty with hairs in another walked into the room they were given to find someone else in bed! Everyone was complaining. Hotel APPALLING and staff UNHELPFUL - AVOID IT AT ALL COSTS!!!! It is famous for being where Glenn Millers stayed and wrote Pennsylvania 65000 - don't think it has been refurbished since he stayed there!!!!,Coley1969
UR2900755,2004-20-December,myself and three friends stayed in the Pennsylvania hotel for 5 nights! we booked two rooms and the first room we were given on the 13th floor was filthy dirty the curtains were black with dirt there were stains on the carpet and the room smelled even though they had the window open when we went into the room. So we went straight back down to reception and demanded that they change our room we did get changed to the 8th floor our room there was a little bit cleaner but not much. The wallpaper was stained from smoke and someparts were peeling off in the corridors. This is the worst hotel i have ever stayed in we even saw some people had pets in their room which i think is disgraceful in an 18 story hotel!!!! the only good thing about the hotel is the location (5mins from Macys). I would not recommend anyone stay in this dirty hotel it is in serious need of a renovation. We had some friends visit us in the hotel and they said they stayed in a hostel in NYC that was nicer than this hotel.,marymc
UR2801332,2004-2-November,Stayed in this dump in May 2002. Booked it through private travel operators who assured us what a wonderful hotel it was. Researching it on the internet (before I discovered the godsend that is tripadvisor) the hotel looked ok; nice rooms and a plush expensive looking lobby. The lobby turned out to be the only part of the hotel that looked anything like the pictures on the net. Shiny and expensive looking the marble flooring should have been an indication of what the rooms would be like upstairs. Oh how wrong we were. Once we stepped out of the lift it was like we had started in the Waldorf Astoria and ended up at the Norman Bates/Psycho motel. The corridors were dark and dingy and painted in a manky pea green colour. Even the doors to the rooms were odd and looked like the hatch doors of a submarine. Once inside it only got worse. The pea green paint continued and the flickering light only made the shabbyness of the room more apparent. The one chipped and stained lamp did not work and the curtains and bed linen looked like they'd seen better days. The bathroom looked like ones that you would see in the tenement buildings of an old late 70's/early 80's movie. Really the Pennsylvania looks exactly what it is; a hotel that in its heyday would have been the epitome of 1930's art deco glamour but which has sadly been allowed to fall into disrepair. Unfortunately now the only thing right with this hotel is it's location (it's bang opposite Madison Sq Gardens Penn Station is next door and the Empire State Building is at the end of the road) but with so many other cheap but nicer hotels right nearby even it's location does not warrant you risking fleabites to stay here.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR1761458,2004-2-April,I have to say having read all reviews I was dreading the hotel. It did live up to the expectations. We had to queue for a long while to check-in and were given a pass for a room on 7th floor. When we opened the door the horror on our faces! Paint and plaster were peeling off walls hole in wall with bare wires exposed the carpet was grubby and obviously had not been vaccumed for quite some time. Room was dusty and again this probably had not seen a polish and duster for a couple of weeks. Bath tub was rusty and gourting had come away from tiles. Bathroom did not appear to have been cleaned. There was no wardrobe facility no dressing table/mirror. There were two beds but I was scepticle in sleeping in these after having seen the decor and the cleanliness of room. We promptly complained and was told by reception there were no rooms available. I asked to see Manager and joined the long queue! I explained to Manager our room was unacceptable and dirty and that I ran a cleaning company and if my staff operated like that they would be dismissed immediately. He did not argue as I was armed with previous internet reviews!! He issued me with another pass to a room on 5th floor which I must say was much better than the first although it still did not meet up to what I expected. The corridors on all floors are pretty grubby and dingy and need redecoration throughout and yes the doors do look like coffin lids! The lobby however is pretty presentable in comparison to the rest of the hotel. The only good thing going for the hotel is the fact that its location is pretty central. I don't think I would go back to this hotel again unless they redecorated it!! Trust me I have pictures to prove it.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2308421,2004-19-July,After discovering tripadvisor a week before a friend and I were due to fly out to New York I was very worried but I thought as long as we felt safe (as we are not even in our twenties) and our room was clean it would be OK. I suppose the one good thing was that when we got there I was expecting the worst - and that was what we got. Having checked in we went in the lift to our room on the third floor. As soon as the lift doors opened the smell hit us - it was terrible - like it hadn't been cleaned for years. However as we knew we were only going to be in the corridors for a short amount of time each day we tried to over look it and proceeded to our room. Walking down the corridors the carpets were stained as were the walls in addition to which the doors of the rooms were mouldy and broken - I can now also see what other tripadvisors meant when they said the doors looked like coffins. When we found our room it was dark and dingy the beds hadn't been made and there was used towels all over the bathroom. I felt quite sure this would happen - it would seem it happens to most people. We then went back to reception where we were allocated a new room but recieved no appolgy for the state of the original room. When we got to the new room on floor seven the room was notabley better which seems unfair on those who are on lower (worse) floors and have paid the same price. However this is not to say that our room was nice although the lighting was better the main lamp did not work. I notice some people have commented that they had stained curtains - we didn't even have curtains. The bathroom was by far the WORST part of the hotel there was a hole in the ceiling the bath was literally flaking away and it was hit or miss as to whether or not our water was BROWN. In terms of the staff some were very friendly and helpful others weren't - either way do not always trust what they tell you as we were informed that the shuttle bus back to the airport would take about a hour/hour and a half tops - it took over two. I would also recommend to avoid the rip off prices in the shop a few stamps a drink and a chocolate bar cost me $14. If like us you are booked into The Pennsylvania Hotel and are now very concerned about what you have read try not to worry too much despite everything that I have told you above we still had a GREAT holiday aided by the hotel's brillant location (it's best feature). At the end of the day we just laughed about it and got on with enjoying our holiday.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR1659679,2004-18-February,I went to this hotel with my husband and some friends for Valentines weekend 2004. I had read the reviews on trip-advisor but as it was already booked I decided to remain optomistic and hope that the negative reviews were exagerated. They were not. It was worse than I ever could have imagined. When we pulled up outside it looked fine and we were pleased with its great location. We entered the lobby and that was still okay. It was big and busy so I was still hopeful! We checked in quickly and made our way up to our room on the 15th floor. As soon as we stepped from the lift I got a taste of things to come. It was nt too bad just looked dated and a bit rough around the edges. As we approached our room I was noticing the doors they were terrible dirty tatty and very old fashioned. Nevermind I thought lets just get in there. We opened the door and the smell that hit us was attrocious. The window was wide open despsite the temperature outside being minus to try and mask the smell. To be honest there was nothing good about the room. The carpet was dirty the wallpaper was thick with grime and hanging off the walls the ceiling was yellow and the paint was peeling. The curtains and nets were also thick with grime and very dirty there is too many things to mention. It was late by then so there was nt much we could do we just got into bed (which thankfully was clean). In the morning I had a fuzzy head from the smell so we went to see our friends room. Although theirs was as tatty as ours at least it did nt smell. As we knew it was just ours we asked reception to change. We were told we could but would need to ask again after 3pm. When we came back to do this we were told under no circumstances could this happen because there had been a flood and 40 rooms had been affected. The man was stressed as he had alot of people to deal with but he was sarcastic with me when I told him why we were unhappy. He said to me 'Madam this is only a 2* hotel you know' I was well aware of that and basic I dont mind but dirt and smells are unacceptable. We had a further 2 nights in this room and were very unhappy. We had some lovely days out but felt really down when we had to come back to the hotel. There was no chance of having a mid day lay down or a lie in we could nt wait to get out. We were lucky that it was an active holiday. We finally found out what the smell was when we heard a dog barking down the corridoor. Animals in a hotel!!! what on earth is that about!!? That is gross. It was also obviosuly a smoking room and years and years of dog smells and smoke had built up to stink out this foul room. The only good things in the hotel were its location and the housekeeping-the beds and towels were always clean. The rest was a disgrace I had to buy slippers so I did nt put my feet on the dirty carpet I had to sleep fully clothed as it was so cold with the window open and we had to buy air freshner to attempt to hide the smell!! What a great Valentines not!!!!!!! Do not stay in this hotel it really is horrible. Pay the small amount extra and find yourself somewhere decent!!!,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2070689,2004-17-May,After reading several bad reviews on the Pennsylvania I was expecting the worst. I had heard that renovations had been taking place at the hotel so I had my fingers crossed. Arrived at the hotel into the posh marble lobbyvery impressive. Queued for a good ten minutes and was expecting a warm welcome a happy smiley face etc but instead had to settle for a few grunts from the staff. Room was on the 7th floor and as in other comments the lift doors open to find a dirty green carpet... the musky smell in the air.. the wallpaper hanging off the damp patches on the ceilings. The room was not much better inside very basic and in need of a good clean. I'm convinced I had the same 3 towels on each of my 3 nights stay just folded up again. The shower stops working when next door is using it and goes very cold and I couldnt see out of the window as it was filthy. The only thing good about this hotel is the location 2 blocks from Empire State and believe me you will be wanting to stay out as long as you can! My girlfriend wouldnt even dare walk barefoot on the carpet! Pay a bit more and go somewhere else!,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2200094,2004-17-June,6/17/04 This hotel is creepy dirty and deceiving. The lobby is beautiful - but when you arrive at your floor it's like you stepped into the Twilight Zone. Peeling wallpaper with splatter stains stains on the carpet...the bathtub looked like a bomb had exploded in it and had a dirt ring to boot. Wore my flip-flops everytime I showered as I was afraid I would catch something. The smell was a combo of mold and dirt. We had to burn scented candles in our room. When we complained we were told that since we booked online we would have to contact the service we used in order to upgrade. We decided after viewing another floor it wasn't worth spending another dime here to upgrade to a slightly better but still creepy room. I will NEVER stay here again. The only good thing is it's in a good location. But next time I will gladly pay more to not stay at the Herman Munster Hotel.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2304724,2004-17-July,okgreat jokewhere`s the cameratake us to our rooms now- please? the worst room we`ve ever spent a night in. stained carpetspeeling wallpaperfilthy curtainsone of the seven dwarfs bedsthe list go`s on. Do not stay here. KEEP AWAY!,A TripAdvisor Member
UR1651784,2004-17-February,Do yourselves a favor and find another place to stay unless you travel with flip flops for the tub and to walk around the room. THe drab wallpaper was peeling the bed was very lumpy and the bathroom has pre-WWII plumbing. Room was a little funny-smelling. The hallways are wide but dreary. Elevators look like they've been recently updated but the renovations apparently stopped there. Only thing good about it is the location. If you only need to sleep for a few hours this is the place.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2898179,2004-17-December,Not the best hotel I have stayed at although was impresed when i wlaked in Nice lobby. Howvere soon as i got into the lift and out on the hallway. what a dump.. it looked like a sleazy hotel the rooms were old and mouldy with plaster falling off!,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2454201,2004-17-August,This hotel was classified as a turn of the century hotel which was to have been restored. Well I felt it must have been restored in the turn of the century. There is a big sign over the check in desk saying " you may rent a smoke detector at an additional price... I thought all hotels had to meet standards. There was peeling paint on the walls the showers and shower curtains had mold on them. They also say that there where data ports in rooms. i asked whyI didnt have one in my room. they said i had to pay more for a better room. Well can tell you i will not stay here again not worth the money....,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2197457,2004-16-June,One of the Pennsylvania's biggest problems in my opinion is the staff. Firstly the hotel is very understaffed and the skeletal staff that they do have are very rude (front desk) very loud (maids) and just not very helpful. After asking 4 different members of staff if there was a toilet in the lobby I gave up as each gave different directions. Waiting for someone to come and open your safety deposit box was a joke. The line to check in is ridiculous. When we eventually checked in and got upstairs we found our card key would not work after using three different keys and going up and down to the lobby three different times and as anyone who has stayed there will know is a chore in itself we eventually go into our room (boy is that lobby deceiving). I think we had it quite lucky at the Hotel Penn after reading some of the other reviews. Our room didn't smell although it was badly in need of a good hoovering and polishing. The location is great can't fault that but the hotel itself is in bad need of a makeover staff and decor. It seems it's the luck of the draw when you stay at the Pennsylvania. Just dont complain if your lucks not in!!!,howied
UR1650932,2004-16-February,My husband and I decided to go to NYC for Valentine's Day to catch a show and see some friends. We had found the Hotel Pennsylvania on line for a very good price ($118). We knew that the location was very good. We accidently stood in the Penn 5000 club line but for $4 were checked into a room. Well the room we were checked into was one of the worst rooms that either my husband and I have ever saw. We knew the hotel was old but the room looked like it was not renovated since the 1940's. Wallpaper peeling paint chipping and a full sized bed that felt like a water bed. We figured that we would deal with it for one night. Well we went to seeour show and came back to freshen up before our dinner. I go to take a shower. I think "Well at least there is great water pressure!" I try to turn off the water. I can't. I notice some of the water streaming outside of the fixture. My husband comes in and I tell him that I can't turn off the water. He tries and more water comes out of the fixture. He calls the front desk and tells them that we are having problems. By the time he's done and I'm dressed the water is coming out of the tile and onto the floor. He calls again then goes downstairs to tell them that they have a big problem. Someone did come up and started to fix it which the water is now into the main room and getting close to the bed. They changed our room immediately (which is much to their credit). We were given a slightly bigger room in a smoking section but it had a King sized bed which when I called to comfirm our room days before they said they didn't have anymore. All in all good for a one night stay but be careful what you pay for.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2886572,2004-16-December,We arrived at this hotel after a long day of travelling to a disgusting smoking room on the 16th floor the dirt and the dust was unliveable in so we went to reception and was told that all the standard rooms are like this so we asked for a no smoking room thinking it may be cleaner. It was a bit better but had mould and damp in one corner of the ceiling paper coming off the walls paint chipped in the bath and dust all over! The tv didnt work and the blind was coming off the window! The only good thing was the change of towels every day and the location which was next door to macys! I would recommend the blarney rock irish bar thats also next door because you may need to get drunk just to go back into your room!,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2576782,2004-15-September,This hotel isnt even worth rating its hell on earth trust me!!!! me and my boyfriend stayed for 8 nights in this hotel at the start of september and i would never set foot in it again. we were very anxious about staying here after reading all the reviews and were thinking surely it cant be that bad BELIEVE ME IT IS!!!!. we had to change rooms five times to even get a room that you could actually stay in. Between the smell of urine and cockrouches i had my fill by day eight. it totally put a damper on our first time in new york believe me it is well worth paying the xtra to stay somewhere else!!!!! ANYWHERE ELSE!!!!,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2826002,2004-15-November,My husband and I are budge travelers so all we expect from a room is that it be clean and have a bed. Seriously we do not ask for much. Well this past Saturday Nov 13 2004 we went to see a show in the city and since my mother-in-law was willing we let her take my son for the night. It was our fist night out in the 7 months since he was born. We figured we would get a hotel and go back to NJ in the morning. Check in at the hotel was fine; the lobby was beautiful and clean. Our room was on the 15th floor when we stepped of the elevator we knew we were in trouble. The hallways smelled disgusting and all the doors and ceiling were decaying. We got to our room and our room smelled just as bad if not worse than the hallway. The walls were actually peeling and furniture was falling apart the walls and floors were filthy it was the worst room I have ever stayed in. They could not even bother to replace a cheap lamp cover that was falling apart. I felt horrible touching anything. We have stayed in cheap hotels before and they were fine. All we are looking for is a place to sleep but I would at least like a place to sleep that I was not afraid to put down my personal belongings. I would never recommend this rattrap. I have written an email to the hotel and am waiting for an explanation. If I had been staying for more than one night I would have raised heck at the front desk. As it was my one night out in ages was ruined.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2300533,2004-15-July,I was planning a short trip to New York Dec 03 & on searching Expedia I found what I thought looked like a reasonably priced Hotel. My decision to book this hotel was largely based on the photographs shown. Big mistake! The lobby looks great & the rooms looked pretty reasonable. On arriving the lobby looked exactly as it did from the photo but boy oh boy did my boyfriend & I get a huge shock. On stepping out of the elevator the corridors were manky & the doors to the rooms were awful. We had booked a non smoking room but on entering our room it stank of cigarette smoke & was dark & miserable. We rang down to reception who informed us that it was supposed to be a non-smoking room! Then in order to get moved to another room we had to go all the way back down to reception. Fortunately we did not have to queue again & we were assured that our next room was non-smoking. The room was still pretty dismal & the bathroom barely hygenic. And there was still cigarette smoke wafting into our room probably from the air vents. The bed was terrible so we didn't sleep particulary well. I know we spent very little time in the room during the day & evening but even still you want somewhere clean & comfortable. The only good thing I can say about the place is that it's directly opposite Penn station & Maddisin Sqare gardens & Macy's is just around the corner. Wish I had heard about Travel Advisor before I booked!,A TripAdvisor Member
UR1650696,2004-15-February,The Hotel Pennsylvania was the worst part of my trip to New York. The lobby emminates a feeling of grandeur however thats where it ends. Our room was a disaster to say the least!!! The door looked like it would fall apart any minute. The room had not been painted in years and the floor was absolutely filty. I wouldn't have wanted my dog to stay in the room. There was used soap in the bathroom and used napkins on the table. The tv remote didn't work and there wasn't even a phone book. The hair dryer was broken and the mirror in the bathroom was probably last cleaned about 5 years ago. I was not surprised when I heard that is where people stay for the Westminster Dog Show because of its proximity to madison Square Garden (right across the street). However these rooms weren't fit for any dog!!!!!! Pay the extra cash and stay at the Hilton or Marriot.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2883785,2004-15-December,Could cope with long queues at reception. Could cope with small size of room. However the Hotel Pennsylvania is just filthy dirty...its as simple as that. The corridors the lifts the doors to the rooms the rooms themselves and especially the carpets and curtains are covered in dark stains and grime. Even the foyer which other reviewers have complimented looks cheap and trashy. The excellent location does not make up for the fact that after a tiring days sightseeing you dread going back to this smelly building. On a more positive note towels were clean and beds were made each day. Staff helpfulness was average. Would definately not stay here again.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR1550757,2004-14-January,My fiancee and I stayed at the Pennsylvania Hotel between 17th Dec - 22nd Dec 2003 and found it to be everything we expected - very basic. The rooms are small and dingy and are in desperate need of refurbishment. However we knew the hotel was a basic 2* hotel and we got what we paid for. There is no better location on the island - a 5 minute walk to Times Square 20 mins to Central Park and 2 minutes from Macy's and the Empire State Building. Madison Square Garden is directly opposite the hotel although I would recommend taking the subway to the financial district - it's a good hour-and-a-half walk. We applied for a New York Greeter before we travelled and I would highly recommend this free service. Hara met us and showed us around Soho Chinatown and Little Italy - all of which are worth seeing even though it is off the tourist track. I would advise going to the Empire State Building first thing in the morning if you don't want to face long queues and try to pick a clear day. Ground Zero is eerily quiet amidst all of the noise in adjoing streets and is worth visiting not as a tourist attraction but more to pay tribute to the people who lost their lives on September 11th. New Yorkers will talk about the events of the World Trade Centre attacks quite openly although you can sense that there is not a day that goes by without them remembering something about that day. Drinks are pricey ($14 for a small wine and a pint of Guinness!!!) as are most restaurants as you would expect from a major city. Ice skating in Central Park is extortionate but worth it for the experience and visit the zoo ($6) whilst you're there. Christmas time is magical in New York but take plenty of warm clothes - the wind chill is biting cold. Overall it is the best place we have ever been to and we will definitely return to NYC - probably in summer next time.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR1783898,2004-14-April,Took a trip there on monday April 12 2004. I have to say i wish i read this board before i went. THIS HOTEL IS THE WORSE! I got a deal(110.00 a night)  and was a prime pick so i gave it a shot. The lobby looked great and clean. The checkin lines were very very long. A tleast a 10 minute wait. When I got to my floor (seventh) i could tell it wasnt going to be good. The walls were very very dirty and the carpet was stained. When i got in the room it wasnt much better. You had to wear something just so you wouldnt get your socks dirty! No view from my window at all and the windows could not even open! The room was very dusty and looks like it wasnt taken care of. No bags in the garbage the tub looked like it been there for years without cleaning with all the stains. The only thing that did this room justice was that it had web t.v. ($5 for half an hour and $3 every hour after that) it also had on demand movies to pay for like pay-per-view ($12 a movie) and you can check out of your room using your t.v. so you dont have to stand again in that long line. At Hotels site they have pictures there of the rooms in Pennsylvania. ITS A LIE! ITS NOTING LIKE THAT AT ALL!! RUN! UNLIKE MOST HOETLS IN NY THERE WAS NOTING IN THE ROOM WORTH "TAKING AS A KEEPSAKE IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN ;) ....THIS IS THE WORST EVER!!,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2822868,2004-13-November,The room was smelly bedding was damp no curtains on window cockroach type creatures crawling around room dirty. Other room offered same. Decided to get another hotel which at gone midnight staff were very un cooperative would not let us use phone or even call the holiday company to sort it out. In desperation we stayed at the astoria just to get somewhere decent. The room was so bad that I wouldent even have put my dog to stay in it. This is the worst hotel I have ever come accross outside of third world countries.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2000921,2004-13-May,Our senior group arrived approx. 40 people. On checking out the room we were assigned we found it was very SMALL. The drapes were partically hung. The TV was not working - (not pluged in) as was the radio--- had to call someoneat 10:30 at night- so we could check the wather for the next day. The bathroom was not up to clean standards especiall the tub -- which was DIRTY. We found the cleaning staff -- annoyed when we asked for towels. Our friends room had NO drapes and they used drapes for bedspreads. But the good news was no cock roaches.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2186128,2004-13-June,This place was God-awful---although the location was perfect I'll admit. I came to NYC to see a Dixie Chicks concert and thought that booking a room right across the street would prove to be very convenient. I would've rather walked 10 blocks to a hotel that would've been acceptable. Stained sheets awful mattress (the coils actually left marks on my back when I woke up in the morning) damp/danky/musty smell stained carpets dilapidated hallways filthy tub..... For those of you who think that the convenience of this hotel (right across from Penn Station) is worth staying here I caution you...your money is wasted here. Stay somewhere else.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2293489,2004-13-July,Brown sludge ozzing out from the bathroom tap; a dry stale air in the room that doesnt move; claw marks on the fungus on the bathroom wall; mold bubbling the wallpaper above the bed; a bed that folded in the middle when you lay on it; filth the glorious filth everywhere; five miles of people complaining at the front desk; miles and miles of filthy carpet to trudge to our stagnant room; in the morning instead of feeling refreshed and ready to go - i wanted to slit my wrist. PLease for the love of god do not stay here.,Carl427
UR2877572,2004-13-December,Have just returned from a four night five day trip to New York where we stayed in the Hotel Pennsylvania. Having read previous reviews I was quite nervous about staying there and had in fact contacted my travel agent well in advance who assured me that they have been booking people into this hotel for years and have never had a complaint! We arrived on Friday 4th December 2004 at approximately 2.00pm. There was a long line for checking in but it moved along nicely. I had booked two rooms one for my husband and myself and the other for my two grown up children. When my husband and myself went to our room we nearly died. Black net curtains on windows curtains falling down blinds broken. The carpet was covered in stains of an unknown nature cigarette burns and bleach stains. Bedspreads were filthy and covered in stains as well. The plaster was peeling off the walls. The bathroom was full of black mold. It was truly awful. The other room wasn't much better. We went down to reception and like other reviewers they agreed to change the rooms without any protest. We were given the key to a new room and said we'd look at it on the condition that we would then decide what room we would stay in. However our names were taken off the system immediately and while we were in our original room dicussing what to do a German gentleman and his son came in and wanted to know what we were doing in their room!! The second set of rooms that we checked out were a bit better than the original rooms but they were still not up to any standard. When we told the gentleman on reception this he told us to contact our travel agent - this was at 5.00pm which was 10.00pm at home!!. We took the new rooms. Our room was clean but it was very very hot. After we had settled in I noticed that the window was open I tried to close it but soon discovered that it wouldn't close. I requested that it be fixed but needless to say it wasn't. As it happened because of the heat in the room if it wasn't open we probably would have roasted. There were no curtains in the room only a torn blind so once it got to 5.30am it was impossible to sleep with the noise of the traffic!!. The room that the children ended up in was really awful. Again no curtains and there was blck mold in the bathroom and behind their beds. The plaster was also peeling off the walls in their room. They were so fed up that they decided to take the room but my daughter didn't sleep the first night as she was so nervous. We ended up having a great time but when you are going away for only a few days you do not want to spend the first 2/3 hours of your holiday traipsing around from room to room and then settling for something that you would never stay in at home. There must be some body in America that polices hotel accommodation. Don't get me wrong I did not expect the Ritz. I knew that this was a very basic hotel but there's a difference between basic and falling apart! By the way one of the reviewers said that the rooms ending in A are better - they're not - the four rooms that we were in had an A at the end of their number!!,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2447808,2004-13-August,As we entered the hotel lobby we were tricked into believing what a beautiful classy place it was. Soon enough we would enter the point of no return meaning we did not want to return to our room! Between pieces of the wall falling off holes in the doors black mildew on the ceiling and shower and unpleasant smell in the room the size of a closet we would not recommend this hotel to anyone average standards of what a hotel should be.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR1783663,2004-13-April,I stayed at the Pennsylvania about two years ago with my husband and a friend. From the recent reviews here I can see that little if anything has changed. It took about 40 minutes to check in which I can understand since this is a large hotel but BEWARE--those beautiful photos of the lobby mean nothing. The rooms are an abomination. Ours had dirty carpet (I never walked around with my socks off) and the furniture and bedspreads had cigarette burns in them. Once I had to pick up an item which had fallen behind a dresser; there must have been a quarter inch of dust underneath it thick as dryer lint. The grouting in the bath was black with mold and the sink drain was full of hair (no stopper). Also don't stay here if you enjoy water pressure with your morning shower. The mattresses were threadbare. I slept on a rollaway cot and got the best end of the deal. Honestly our room looked and felt like 20 guys had held a bachelor party in it the night before and someone had spent maybe 15 minutes cleaning it up. The management could offer me free stays anytime I wanted for life and I'd refuse it.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2877006,2004-12-December,we stayed at this hotel from the 8/12/04 for 3 nights had no problams checking in the lobby was clean and tidy wish i could say the same for the rooms mold on the ceiling's wall paper hanging of the walls which i think was the original paper from the 1920's shower was dirty luckely we did not have to spend a minute longer in the hotel room than we had toonly good point about this hotel is it's locaitioun which is central to most of the sights........,A TripAdvisor Member
UR1775290,2004-12-April,Yes believe all the negative reviews you are reading here! Wished I read the reviews before booking the reservation. We paid the rooms in advance so there was no way of getting our $ back. Absolutely not worth $150/night... matter of fact not even worth $5/night. I have never witnessed such horror in my life. Do not let those "nice" pictures you find on the internet fool you. Do not let the nice lobby fool you. First room was so digusting...stained carpets fifthy bathroom twin size bed w/dirty linen. We went back to the lobby & asked for another room. Second room...more of the same fifth. Third room...more of the same...with as an added bonus....blood stains on the sheets. By this time we were so exhausted by all the drama so we settled for a 4th room on the 9th floor. It was still disgusting but better than the other 3. We had to shower w/our slippers on just to paint you a picture. My advice...PLEASE DO NOT STAY HERE!!!,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2818983,2004-11-November,Arrived 01/11/04 at 13:00 and we were allowed to check in early. By 13:30 we had changed our room three times the receptionist was happy to keep changing until I was happy(ish). Some rooms are better than others the worst rooms are uninhabitable the best rooms are just acceptable. The web site is about 5 years out of date the receptionist told me that the refurbishment was carried out about the same time. Knowing what I know now I would return to this hotel (great price) but I wouldn't stay here longer than 2 nights. I've been told that the YMCA is just as good and only costs a couple of dollars a night. It's a great location you get clean towels your room cleaned and bed made up every day but don't expect anymore than that. You shouldn't have any problems with the staff some are very friendly the rest are polite. Take the journey New York is the new Rome but don't forget some comfortable shoes!,A TripAdvisor Member
UR1720195,2004-11-March,Stayed here May 2003 absolutely disgusting! Don't be fooled by the grand lobby or the history of the hotel. We stayed on the 7th floor and it was one of the worst hotel rooms I have ever had the displeasure to see. The room was old with crumbling plaster on the walls and large holes with wires hanging out seriously! The lamp in the room was extremely worn and was probably original hotel furniture the tv was tiny and there were doors through to the rooms either side that were sealed by locks and door chains. The bathroom was adequate until you realised that there was no hot water at certain times of the day. The concierge is absolutely rubbish and after asking her to advise us of a nice Italien restaurant she sent us to one of the most limited and expensive restaurants I've ever seen (and I live in London) where the menu consisted of about 20 dishes in total mostly oysters and other exotic overpriced and overated foods. The Lindy's "restaurant" in the hotel is also disgustingly overpriced with a meal for 3 consisting of 3 soft drinks a sandwich a burger and chicken nuggets accompanied by two pieces of cake cost $80!! No kinding DO NOT eat here! Finally on our final morning not only was there NO water in the shower but the water in the sink was BROWN! Needless to say I had a very smelly journey home! Do not stay here unless absolutely neccessary!,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2875774,2004-11-December,Just returned from New York on Dec 8. Don't be fooled by the photographs shown on there web-page or any other web-page that you may find this hotel. The entrance to the hotel is grand marble floor etc. once inside the lift and you head to your floor. doors open nice huge entrance on the floor turn the corner down the corridor and that's when you see the problems. unwashed walls. wallpaper peeling of paint coming of the ceiling unfinished doors. the corridors look well dodgy and the rooms aren't that much better just your standard hotel room [bed tv shower etc]- we bumped into another couple who where staying on the same floor as us  and they expected to see to see the twin girls from the film "the shining" standing at the bottom of the corridor as the lighting of the hallway is poor. However on saying that - The hotel is in a excellent location and the staff are very friendly and willing to help you out if you need any assistance It's a 15 mins walk to time square/broadway 20-25 mins walk to central park macy's is just around the corner empire state building is 15 mins away Grand Central Station and Rockafeller Center is 20-25 mins walk away from hotel. I wouldn't eat in the restuarant in as its expensive and you can get a really good food across the street at Blarneys Rock pub [this Irish pub is excellent - well worth a visit for the food drink and general chit/chat] Would i stay there again - Probably yes due to its excellent location. but i would request a room on floors 1 to 4 as i've been told by guests that where the best rooms are. and we were on the 16th floor and its no penthouse up there i can tell you that for a fact.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2522665,2004-10-September,I stayed in this hotel from September 1st through the 8th. I just wanted to say that I was totally disappointed in the room. From all the pictures on their website the hotel looked beautiful. When I arrived we were given a room that was very small and covered in mold. I went and complained to the front desk and I was given a different room. It was a little better in the fact that there was no mold but the dresser was missing handle to the drawers. The carpet was filthy. I left a twist tie on the floor in plain view and it was never picked up the whole time I was there. So I doubt the floor was vacuumed the whole week. I think if they are going to show the nice rooms that are on their site they should deliver. I have even looked at pictures on other sites that have pictures of the rooms. I know some have been renovated and some havent and still our room didnt look like anything shown. I am surprised that they havent been sued for false advertising. If I could have found something else in such a short time I would have. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. I will be telling everyone not to stay there.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2817893,2004-10-November,This is definitely the worst hotel I've ever come across. Please don't be fooled by the hotel lobby. It is the grimiest shabbiest place. There were stains on walls bare spots where the carpet wore off shabby furniture mold everywhere! I was genuinely concerned of mice and roaches. The staff was extremely hostile. Please please don't make the same mistake I made; there are definitely cheaper cleaner alternatives in Manhattan.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2178269,2004-10-June,I booked on a site that had no reviews for a discount and that was my big mistake. The first room they took me to - a squatter had slept there! And the room was like the nightmare scenes in "Barton Fink." They moved me to a better room which was worse...stained carpets and bedclothes musty smell moldy ceilings crumbling walls holes in the bathroom walls...I killed 2 cockroaches the size of my toothbrush. The the cracked stained faucet leaked for 3 days while they ignored my complaints. There was only a wooden desk chair. I finally bought my own bottle of Febreeze and 2 roach motels...the next day they cleaned up the traps but didn't get the exterminator in. The whole time the staff were curt and patronizing. ("Cockroaches sir...I'm shocked!" snort.) Don't stay here. Campgrounds would be cleaner.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2287371,2004-10-July,We got told that this hotel was "nothing special but clean cheap and in a great location" so we thought that would be ok as we would not really be in the hotel very often in NY. Well the hotel was not clean at all! The outside and reception looked ok apart from a bucket of water catching water dripping from a hole in the ceiling. When the elevator opened on the floor to our room we got a horrible surprise! The carpets were damp and the wallpaper was practically hanging off the wall with dampness! The room was tiny dirty and disgusting! We asked to get moved to another room which we did but it was exactly the same! Very dirty damp and smelly! The first night we got to NY we spent the first few hours trying to find another hotel it was that bad! As for this hotel being ok and clean that is not the case! I would have rather slept in the back seat of my car than this hotel. It really was terrible!!!!,vikkij1980
UR2800109,2004-1-November,The worst hotel room I have ever had. The outside and lobby make you think that the place is ok. The room was disgusting. It smelled like someone had been smoking pot for 6 months straight in our room. There was pubic hair in the sink and shower. There was dirt and grime everywhere. I don't know how we slept there. Thank god we got tanked at a wedding before returning to the hotel. I would never never stay there again.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR2142668,2004-1-June,I was a bit worried when I read all of these terrible reviews. I found my experience to be almost completely opposite of everyone elses. We were checked in withing 5 minutes. The reception people were very nice. The room was old and shabby but clean. It's not the Ritz but considering it was about $110 per night and was a 5 minute walk to Times Sq. it was worth every penny. If you are a bit of a snob and expect to get the Waldorf and Super 8 prices this place is not for you. If all you plan to do is sleep there go for it. It's not a room to lounge around in all day.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR1760560,2004-1-April,First room was tiny musty bathroom had mould when I complained I was offered another room at double the cost. Very disappointing experience.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR1075344,2003-9-June,I stayed this hotel for 1night(luckly) and was surprised by the water from tab or shower. Small brown crumble DIRT came out constantly!!! It didn't stop!!! Normally it should stop in first few munites or so but it didn not stop my entire shower time at all!! BUT not only DIRT also water was not clear it was yellow.....Well you should watch water for few munites or so BEFORE you take shower!!,A TripAdvisor Member
UR1510884,2003-9-December,My advice would be to avoid this hotel or at least have low expectations of what you will get for your money. We travelled in early December so paid more than usual which made the hotel experience even more disappointing - take no notice of any picture you see of the hotel - the nice rooms may exist but they are in the minority. Reception is chaotic with largely unhelpful staff and resembled a back-packers dorm with all the students sitting on the floor!! The room was poor really shabby - tired decor dirty bathroom ripped and stained bedsheets - a generally depressing room - we moved to a better one when we found there was no hot water but it was still a big disappointment - but as we were there to enjoy New York we weren't in the room much - just as well!! We even had to pay to leave luggage for 2 hours after we checked out!! Only positive is the location which is a big plus.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR1442361,2003-8-November,This hotel is the pits.Budget I can handle - even tatty but this was down right filthy. The 1st room allocated was already occupied the 2nd was disgusting and the 3rd was real Tat'. Weekend of marathon so had little choice but to stay but nevernever never again. Don't do it!!!!,mammacaz
UR1219766,2003-8-August,You have to read this before you go! I stayed at this hotel in April 2004. I checked in at about 10PM. After having to stand in a queue for about 1 hour with all my suitcases and really tired i finally got my key chucked at me by a girl that did not even care who I was. I went up to my room walking down the corridors I got this really bad feeling the room was going to be bad because the corridors look like something out of a Horror movie. I got into my room. Shock Horror the bed had dirty sheets someones blood on it. I did not open the closet or drawres for the week I was there because they where AWEFULL. I lived out of my suitcase. I was worried of even having a shower there it was filthy. My TV set was just standing there on a wooden apple box and to top it off my room overlooked another roof on the next building and every morning there where people walking on that roof and they would look into my room as there where no curtains. This hotel should be either knocked down or shut down and renovated. I still can't believe I chose this hotel. It's the first time I chose a hotel because it was cheap and whitout looking in the books and I have stayed in NYC often I should have gone to my known hotels. If you are going to stay here get a REFUND and get another hotel....If not for yourself this WILL ruin your time in NYC!!!,kristofd
UR1440559,2003-6-November,We arrived in NYC for a five night stay and were due to spend one night at the Hotel Penn before moving onto the Hudson. When we got into the lobby there were exposed cables and wires everywhere and the carpets were filthy. Upon arrival in the room there was blood on the walls! The bathroom was also very grimy with dead wasps floating in the toilet bowl. Even though it was already 10pm we checked out the same evening and went to the Edison - I would never return to this hotel. Please do not waste your money!,A TripAdvisor Member
UR1507825,2003-5-December,I stayed there in November and although I wasn't expecting much I was disgusted by the room I was given. It was small shabby dirty. The window wouldn't close all the way. The towels had stains on them. There was a wet towel on the floor of the shower stall when I checked in. There were holes dents scuff marks on the walls. And to top if all off I left the place with bed bug bites on my arm. I would never stay there again.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR1429426,2003-30-October,There was menstruation in the toilet bowl when we got there. I'd rather go on a death march than be forced to step in the lobby. If there was someone threatening to kill me if I didn't stay there suicide would be my Disney World. It was supposed to be my boyfriend and my first romantic getaway. We broke up because Hotel Pennsylvania.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR1533014,2003-30-December,My boyfriend and I were booked at the Hotel Pen on 10 Dec 2003 for 5 nights. We had read the reviews and were fearing the worst.... When we arrived we asked for a renovated room but am not sure what we got. Our room was on the 6th floor. When I saw the room it was much better than I expected it was small and one of the lights was not working but apart from that it was fine. The bed sheets were clean as was the bathroom and it was cleaned everyday with fresh towels. We had a fully working TV hairdryer. But be warned the walls are extremely thin you can hear EVERYTHING. I found all staff very helpful and polite at all times. This hotel is in an ideal location. We watched basketball at MSG and it was great to be able to just walk across the road back to the hotel. Macys Time Square and the Empire state building are all a few minutes walk away. This was my first trip to New York and I had a fantastic time with no bad memories.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR1501736,2003-29-November,I stayed at Hotel Pennsylvania on November 25. My boyfriend and I were up the for the Jay-z concert at Madison Square Garden. The hotel is in a excellent location. The rooms weren't so excellent. My just reminded ourselves that it was somewhere that we was just resting our heads for just for one night. The paint on the walls were chippingthere was a stain on our comforter. The refrigerator look horrible it made you afraid to put anything in there. The carpet and walls had stains. The best part to me must have been the bathroom that was somewhat clean. I wouldn't say that I would not stay here again but I would look around first. The price and the lobby looks good but thats it.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR1500487,2003-28-November,I visited the Pennsylvania Hotel this November. I expected the hotel to be basic but not to the extent where i had to clean the room myself. The rooms were dirty (you needed to keep shoes on at all times!) and the bathroom definately hadn't been cleaned between guests. If you dont mind a bit of dirt this hotel is perfect for sight seeing in New York and is central to all the main shopping areas. The lobby area is large and clean and the staff seemed really friendly. My advice to anyone visiting this hotel would be not to expect too much and stay out of the shower you might catch something!!!!,A TripAdvisor Member
UR1531692,2003-28-December,As like everyone else I had read the reviews on here and was dreading it. I had also read that if you were lucky enough to get a room above the 10th floor you would be ok and that the rooms were re-furbished. This is NOT the case. We were allocated the 16th floor(room 1631). The room was absolutely huge but very old and very basic. There were curtain rails but no curtains! The carpets were very worn bedding shabby etc but it was warm and clean. I did request a change of room but the reception staff as obviously used to this request and point blank refused telling us that the hotel was full and that we weren't able to swop rooms with a later arrival that wasn't yet there. They asked us to return the next day at 2pm which quite obviously you wouldnt do as you wouldnt waste a day of your holidays (a fact I am sure they are well aware of). To be fair by day two we were used to it and it wasn't all that bad. At the end of the day you only sleep there and the loaction is fantastic. What you get in your room is very hit and miss  some have hairdryers and fridges and some dont its just pot luck! I requested a hairdryer one evening to be told it was on route  after various calls for 2 hours I was told in actual fact they didn't have any! The New Yorkers are quite abrupt but this is just there way so dont take it personally.,BREG
UR1422764,2003-27-October,The room at the Pennsylvania Hotel was one of the worst I've ever stayed in (and that includes some really bad fishing camps). The bathroom was filthy! Cables exposed in several locations with holes in the walls. Shower head sprayed water all over the bathroom. When we arrived the room smelled like a bottle of bleach! The ads for this hotel appear to be inaccurate - the room we stayed in had not been remodeled in 50 years! It was a terrible selection - we wouldn't recommend to anyone!,A TripAdvisor Member
UR1499288,2003-26-November,I stayed at the Hotel Pennsylvania from November 9 - 16 2003. The location of the hotel is excellent - just directly opposite Penn Station with the subway just next to it. I paid $109 per night plus tax for a standard double room. Room 239 was spacious - it had a walk-in wardrobe complete with ironing facilities. However the room showed signs of ageing. Wallpaper was peeling off from the wall. When I turned on the bathtub tap rusty water flowed out. There was little space on the ledge above the washbasin to put toileteries. Information in the folder was outdated and there was no hotel stationery provided. The telephone charges are exhorbitant - toll-free calls cost 95 cents per call and a 5-minute long-distant call to New Jersey cost $19!! The hotel lobby although spacious was always crowded with people checking in and checking out or loitering around the theater booking counter. The front desk staff were unfriendly and robotic - not a single smile on their face when checking in. I was not even informed that I had to present a credit card in order to activate the telephone line in the hotel room and there was no information on the telephone call charges. Check out was a big hassle - the queue was long and the service slow - it took about half an hour to check out. Luggage storage was charged at $4 per piece. If you want a room in an excellent midtown Manhattan location with a reasonable price Hotel Pennsylvania has it but be prepared for what I have just mentioned.,aukahkay
UR1421450,2003-25-October,I would never stay here again. It was truly the worst place i have stayed. The rooms are dark dirty and you get teh feeling that the carpets. curtains if you can call them that and the blankets have not been cleaned since the hday the place was built. The final straw for me was when i ran teh shower : i was greated with torrents of brown water filling the bath. I stayed one night and left. Never again. I spend the rest of my stay and my other trips at the Park Central on 7th Avenue. Great place,simonharris
UR1148726,2003-25-July,Okey I got som problems during my stay at this hotel. 1: I've seen clearer tap water before.. 2: They tried to make me pay more money than I actually spent. 3: A lady knocked on my door asking for help because she had lost her sister the day before and still hadn't got the chance to call the police. The in-room phone was blocked for such calls and the people working in the reception "couldn't help her". It's amazing! She borrowed my cell phone.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR1144243,2003-23-July,I would suggest this hotel be used as a last resort. While it does have a "perfect" location to Madison Sq. Garden and Empire St. Building ... the staff are for themost part useless. You should not be shocked to wait in line for a couple hours to get your room. The hotel restaurant "Lindys" is an example of the phrase "greasy spoon". The hotel underwent a recent renovation so it is actually improved from years past. But halls are dark. Rumors of "friends" visiting at night are a typical complaint as are complaints of smelling an odor of urine. If you are just staying one night will likely be intoxicated and coming from a Nicks game ... this might be the hotel for you. Otherwise there are other options in this property's price range.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR1347501,2003-22-September,We stayed in this hotel in June 2002 for 5 days. Before booking we viewed their website and the hotel & rooms looked clean and tidy.However on arriving at the hotel at about 11pm at night we where dropped off at the side entrance which looked like a run down building. We managed to find our way to the marble cladded lobby and we breathed a sigh of relief because it looked nice and exactly matched what we had seen on their website previously. This however was short lived once arrived at our room as I have never seen such a dull shabby and dirty hole in all our travelling. The bed linen and walls were dirty and the fridge whined and smelled. The bathroom was shabby with a hole and mould on the ceiling. Our view through the window was other hotel windows and the curtains where dirty. Its was now about 11.30pm at night and we complained to the management as we had asked for a room with a view that was clean. They told us that they only had another 1 room available and that we would have to speak to the manager in the morning. We were given another room but were told that it had not yet been refurbished. We nearly died when we arrived at this room. The door was smashed in and just about locked and another two doors lead to other rooms and didnt even lock. I managed to push a sofa against one to stop it opening. The curtains had a natural black tinge that had been amassed over years and again the bedsheets were filthy. The carpet was worn right through to the floor in certain areas and the bathroom was falling apart. It was now 12pm at night and we had no alternative but to sleep on our coats on top of the bed. I phoned our travel agent in the uk at about 4am and he arranged another room overlooking madison square garden which was better but again wasnt that clean and extremely basic. While we stayed there no one ever cleaned our room but only changed the towels every other day and the personnel were very unhelpful. Please be careful if you do chose this hotel as New York is a wonderful holiday and this hotel may spoil it for you. Please note We were also ripped off by a company called the new york airport service who kept us waiting for almost 45 mins at the airport after telling us we would only be there about 10 mins and also dropped us of in the middle of New York when they stated they would drop us of at our hotel this cost us $45. It cost us another $20 to get to the hotel from where they dropped us off. They didnt want to know ethier when i rung them up. My advice stay somewhere else and get yellow cabs everywhere cause they are cheaper direct and easier to use.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR1525753,2003-21-December,We went in this hotel in Summer 2001. After 45 mn of waiting to get a room previously booked through a travel agent (I do not make this error) we entered in a tiny room. It was dirty without daylight. The ceiling was stained by numerous prior water damage (see the picture on Virtual tourist). The sheets are also dirty with a piece of chewing gum glued on one of them. The sign "on remodeling" was in the stairs. Reading the previous reviews I see the hotel is still in remodeling two years after our stay (good excuse). There was an expensive valet parking : 35$ daily. We had to ask our car one hour before the departure. So I did. But I had to wait my car 30 mn more because my request done on time was not registred. The employee was surprised to have no tip. Stingy Frenchman !,A TripAdvisor Member
UR1494139,2003-20-November,What a mess! The bathroom looked like someone had died in the bath likewise the carpet. I'm all for New York attitude but the staff were rude to the point of hostility. The final straw was having NO hot water EVERY morning. Pay a bit more and go elsewhere!,A TripAdvisor Member
UR1525498,2003-20-December,I am just back from New York a few days and would advise anyone to avoid this hotel. I have been to New York twice before so I knew what to expect. The hotel has only one thing going for it it's location! The first two rooms we were given were filthy the carpets were stained the walls and ceiling were peeling. After much complaining the third room was a little better and due to having travelled for hours we settled for it. I was not looking for anything fancy all I wanted was a clean room! My advice there are far nicer hotels for around similar prices - don't go here.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR1504120,2003-2-December,We stayed at the Pennsylvania from 26th Nov - 1st Dec it was our first trip to NY and I can honestly say it's the worst hotel I have ever stayed in!!! Admittedly I knew it wasn't going to be the best hotel in NY for the money were were paying but i did expect it to be clean. First impressions were good the lobby was really nice and clean. However it went downhill from there. We complained about the first room we were given on the 4th floor the room a 'superior king size room' was disgusting it was cramped dusty the carpet was filthy and the bathroom must have been built for a midget and had very suspicious stains in the bathtub. The second room no 736 was bigger but not much had a king size bed with a newish bed cover and a cleaner bathroom. However the carpet looked as though it had never been hoovered. We weren't happy but the hotel was full due to thanksgiving so we conceded as long as the carpet was vacuumed which the guy in the grey suit (looked inportant) said he would sort for us. This didn't happen so I called housekeeping and still it wasn't sorted so when we got back from our meal on the evening I spotted one of the maids on our floor and asked if I could use the hoover she obliged and at least afterwards we could walk around without our shoes on. We also had a wonderful experience with 'Cyril' the cockroache i couldn't work out whether he arrived in the bathroom via the plughole or via the hole in the bathroom ceiling. We'd also love to know if anyone is planning to stay here soon if the 3 jelly babies are still on the floor by the lifts on the 7th floor? On the plus side though the location is great it didn't take us long to check in and out and we did have fresh towels every day and the bed was changed daily. We have now learnt a valuable lesson and we will always read reviews of any hotels that we planning to visit in future. We wouldn't recommend for anyone to stay in this hotel but we didn't let it spoil our trip to New York.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR1520065,2003-17-December,Like everyone else we booked a deal through an Agent in June this year and then found this site and have been reading it over the last few months with mounting horror. I booked for myself and 8 others so I obviously lost a lot of sleep worrying what they would make of it. I tried to change the hotel but the agent we booked with said that they had only ever had one complaint from a traveller about the Pennsylvania and assured us it would be fine. We arrived on the 10 December (for 5 nights) and were given three triple rooms on floor 3. We made our way up fully expecting horrors. The rooms were bad no view dirty and smelly. We returned to reception and after asking to see the manager (who never appeared) were given a suite consisting of three triple rooms on the 15th floor. These rooms were marginally better at least the bathrooms were clean we were together and we had a magnificent view of the Empire State Building. On our last day I asked my friends if they would stay at this hotel some would and some said not. For the price (we paid about 20 a night per person) - we couldn't really complain - I think it could have been a lot worse. I have just read on the site that someone had bed bug bites (I was wondering what the bites were on my neck and arms - now I know!!). For myself I don't think I would stay there again I would save up a little extra and research any hotel on this site before I booked anything. I have since returning (yesterday) checked my credit card account to find that the hotel have put in a charge of 450.00 - you can imagine I was in tears!. Apparently this is something that some hotels do and my cc company have informed my that it should be taken off in a few days. I will let you know if they don't.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR1089779,2003-15-June,I had booked a room here online and admittedly had some doubts about it after reading these postings however I decided to give it a try anyways. I had pre-paid for the room and arrived around 9 pm. When I went up to my room it had not been cleaned yet so I had to go out for a while to let the housekeeper change the sheets etc. The carpet and walls were filthy even had some graffiti on the wall. The air conditioner unit was falling out of the wall bottoms of the furniture hanging out holes in the wall where either a picture or mirror had hung but you could see the outline from years of cigaratte smoke. The worst thing about this place was the noise! I had to endure listening to the people in the room talking until 3 am...the walls were paper-thin. I honestly could not recommend this place...next time I won't be so cheap and will stay in a better place.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR1487305,2003-13-November,This was my first trip to NYC (Nov 5th - 9th)and my friend booked through an English based operator offering budget deals. We were impressed by the photos and booked. Everything they said was correct great location you are bang in the middle of Manhattan with the Empire State 5 mins away and Macy`s just two blocks away and the convienience of transport right on your doorstep. Reception was busy queued for ten minsand a not particularily pleasant woman checked us in. Security to the lifts was good and the elevators had cameras and Tv screens showing CNN. (only in America) Then we got to our 7th floor room?? After fiddling with our electronic key we pushed open the heaviest metal door ever passing graffiti on the wall "I want your money" It was a large room with 2 beds and a bathroom with a bath and shower. The thing that dissapointed us was that the websites we had seen had described the hotel as being refurbished. We found out that the pictures are of mainly superior and business class rooms and not what you get for budget (58 per night.)which plainly have not been refurbished. The bath was badly chipped and had been painted! the toilet had the slowest weakest flush I have ever seen but best was the hairdryer that was positioned so close to the sink that you could easily knock it when washing?? The shower worked and we had hot water. The closet had not been cleaned the ironing board was filthy and the carpet was stained throughout. There was a bloodied band aid on one of the beds and one bed had crumbs all over it. The lighting was poor we had a window but this looked into the side of the front of the hotel (other rooms) and the window opened with great difficulty to be governed by a wire allowing it only to open 6 inches?? The curtains were black mouldy and stained. The colour tv worked (fab choice) but there were wires exposed everywhere all over the room and holes where gawd only knows what lurked within. We complained at the desk and were told the hotel was full but "Harry" was really nice and let us see another room but to our horror this was the tiniest room ever with a huge mould patch growing up the wall. We decided to stay in ours. We werent in NYC to stay in our room and it was safe cleaned everyday fresh sheets towels etc and a bonus it was quiet no noisy neighbours or street sounds. I wouldnt neccesarily stay again and by some of the other reviews it looks like we were lucky however if you want budget location and are willing to take a gamble as to what sort of room you get then this is the place. I always thought Americans were quite fussy about things like this but this hotel gave a different view. All said though we had a fantastic time and the people of NYC are the friendliest I have ever met and TIMES SQ.. wow ....Piccadilly Circus you can keep. I have since complained to the website we booked through and told them they need to review their descriptions.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR1482459,2003-12-November,Thankfully had read the bad reviews before going so did not expect much. First point of contact was obviously reception and someone should tell Vlada to get the sour expression from her face...a smile does not cost anything! Corridors were filthy and smelly room was dingy but bedding at least was clean. The door to our room kept jamming and we could not get out of it the first morning and with bars on the windows it is a real fire hazard. Do not book anything through the hotel information desk as they give out the wrong information saying packages are not available when they are book direct with the operators.,A TripAdvisor Member
UR1076795,2003-11-June,My son who lives in Washington my sister who lives in Mississippi and I stayed at this Hotel in late April 2003. The lobby was lovely (not enough seating). The rooms however leave much to be desired. The walls are bare and the room we stayed in had a funky odor to it. The bathroom looked AWFUL. Over the sink they have a countered made out of a piece of wood with brackets holding it up. Reminded me of something a 12 year old would make in shop class in junior high school. Make sure you don't eat in the resturant located at the front of the hotel. The prices are WAY to high. Go to the corner and get something to eat at the pizza place. They have fantastic prises and the food is great. In ending I won't EVER stay at the hotel again.,A TripAdvisor Member
