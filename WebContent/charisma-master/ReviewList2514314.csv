UR125709632,2012-6-March,Can't say anything nice about my recent experience staying here. The rooms are in bad repair and have had nothing spent on repair since Travelodge took the building over from Holiday Inn Express. Rooms are dirty holes in walls fixtures hanging off walks. TVA without remote controls. Dare I go on? I can talk in the plural as several of my colleagues stayed here and had the same experience. Come on Travelodge. Do something about the premises or do you just not care?,DJN97
UR122636023,2012-5-January,On arrival it became apparent the type of hotel it was to be.First impressions were it was very dirty in that litter was visible all around the foyer. People were hanging about the cafe/bar and sleeping.I asked for a quiet room at the back of the building as I work nights.I was given room 003 on the bottom floor adjacent to the linen room and overlooking the North Circular Road. Room was changed at my request to 528 on the 5th floor.As you exit the lift a twin socket is attached to the wall with silver duc tape the carpet is filty and again the rips and tears are covered in silver duc tape the whole length of the corridor.On entering the room the curtains are hanging off the rails. On checking the bed I find rose petals behind the headboard nail clippings all over the carpet. A light fitting in the bathroom over the shower is not working and this is probably due to the obvious leak from the shower in the room above.Got to be a safety risk from electricity here.I had pre booked breakfast. Travelodge policy states this would be served at 0800hrs on bank holidays they decided to serve it at 0900hrs on the 1st day and 0915hrs the 2nd day. This meant me being out of bed for longer after returning from a 12hr night shift.Even though I had explained I worked nights I was woken by staff twice before 12 midday to make sure I was checking out even though I had a confirmed week long booking which been paid for. Noise levels during the day were unacceptable during the day. If I had made the noise during the night that others made during the day I believe the Police would have been called and I would have been asked to leave/possibly arrested.Travelodge have offered me an Evoucher to the value of 50 which has a shelf life until July 2012.,neil a
UR127323286,2012-5-April,We booked in to this Travelodge as we had booked a tour around wmbley StadiumI really wish we hadn't. Our Family room had plastic skirting board which hadn't been joined up the corners were either broken or missing leaving exposed cables.A long sheet of Wallpaper was peeling off one wall there were two wall lights one with it's shade missingl eaving wires visable. The bed side lights were very nice and attatched to the headboard unfortunatly one was totally missingthe latch on the window was completly loose.In the toilet out of two spotlights only one worked and the other had been pushed up in to the holder and just leftthe plastic tiolet roll holder had been smashed and had a hole in it. When we were in the dining room all the tabletops wobbled one of the easy bucket chairs had obviously been broken at some time and a piece of wood had been attatched to it to act as a leg! I have written to Travelodge but they haven't even had the decency to reply it says it all. They had a lot of contract workers in so this is obviosly the clientel they are aiming at.,melanie m
UR123774178,2012-29-January,I don't know where to begin with this hotel. It must be one of the worst places I have ever experienced. It pulls down the Travelodge brand and appears completely cut adrift from any claims the company has of being a brand to be trusted. Everything about Wembley was negative - from the utterly inadequate breakfast to general cleanliness. Ringing in my ears will always be the plea from a man on reception when I checked out - if I awarded this hotel more than 7 on the emailed feedback sheet they would receive extra funding from Travelodge HQ. There's no way I could lie to such an extent as to award this much points at all. I urge anyone who needs a cheap place to stay in London to try anywhere else - literally anywhere. I cannot agree enough with the other negative reviews.,D0kt0rb
UR125408910,2012-29-February,Have just returned from a 2 night stay and have NOW read the reviews and seen the photos. (I wouldn't bother to look at Tripadvisor for reviews of a Travelodge as we have stayed in lots of them in town or city centres on motorway service stations and along main routes. I trusted the brand and thought I knew what to expect. Many leave a lot to be desired but you know you are not paying for The Ritz.) Our impressions are not influenced by these reviews but are our own findings. This Travelodge is GRIM. We normally take the train to London and stay centrally but this time we were driving. We chose this Travelodge because it was easy to find close to a tube station and had parking. Yes it was also cheap. The photo on the website does not do justice to the outside of the building which is incredibly shabby. It makes little difference whether you enter by the front door flanked by a pair of planters filled with fag ends and vomit or the back door next to the delapidated shed containing rubbish bins and a broken bed. Trust instead the reviewers photos and comments. Add to this dirty lifts rucked up carpets held together with gaffer tapewater stained ceilings traffic noise and the smell from food factories front and back. This is what you can expect at Wembley. Being early and unable to check in we drove around to check out the local area where England welcomes the world to the jewel in the crown of association football. We concluded that it had no redeeming features. We drove back & paid to park at the hotel walked through the intimidating rubbish strewn wasteland to Stonebridge Park tube station and spent the afternoon in the West End. Upon returning that night we were apprehensive about what we would find inside. Our room was clean (apart from the windows which were filthy despite being on the 5th floor) but worn. Housekeeping was adequate 2 lights had no bulbs the TV remote didn't work and the sink had no plug.These are minor faults that management can influence compared to the bigger job that is the general state of the building which is down to the company itself. Our room was at the front so the traffic noise is intrusive but only to be expected. On the positive side our fellow guests were quiet and there were no crying babies or rowdy drinkers. Or maybe we just couldn't hear them. In view of the neighbourhood we left the car in the car park for the 2 days of our stay and spent the entire time in Central London. 5 per day is not a lot to pay when on street parking off Wembley high street was 1.50 for 40 minutes but we would have been very concerned had we seen the pictures of smashed car windows beforehand. Although we had planned to spend the rest of today in London we checked out at 9.30. The receptionist who like all the staff we spoke to was helpful and friendly. Despite the fact that he must have received negative feedback many times before he actually asked if everything had been alright during our stay!!!! We couldn't wait to get on that North Circular Road and head out of London. And they say 'it's grim up north'.,laNyonsaise
UR125292306,2012-27-February,This place was terribleOn the busy north circular the window did not shut properly the catch was broken so noise level was awful.Opposite a noisy food factory we didnt have a plug for the sink the plastic skirting board was broken exposing sharp edges.The breakfast was very poor little choice of low quality products we tried some food from the bar menu awful.The fridges in the bar dont work so warm bottles yuk there was also feet missing off both beds .Absolute dump never again.,Expo999
UR126291370,2012-18-March,Tired looking tape on the carpet in the corridors. too much noise coming through the Bedroom windows staff agreed. smell of cigerette smoke from room next door. Was told security went and gave them a warning. swapped rooms / floor but same problem with window (pull it closed and no noise /let go noise returns). Strong smell of marijuana in the corridor on this floor so told them not staying. Moved to the travel lodge on royal park much better. Seems travel lodge just doesn't care about this hotel??!,Zahid B
UR122376216,2012-1-January,Got this hotel for 4 days over the new years period. Reading the reviews I imagined it to be a poor standard but because it had a carpark and easy to get to from where Im located I thought Id go for it. Now from where I live up the M1 it was easy to get to so thats a big plus. The secure carpark is 5 daily and it pay and display. Doesnt seem overly inforced by anyone though onsite so leeway I imagine is used if you are over you time. The carpark is not locked it has a barrier but it looks like it has been broken off. The gate so you can not enter the grounds is also never locked. I would advise if parking in the grounds park as close the the major entrance as you can or something you can see from the bedroom. You can test your luck and park on the Rd although I saw afew cars broke in there over the last 3 nights I was around the area So I wouldnt do it for sake of a fiver. The hotel is VERY basic. The staff are fine never had a problem with dealing with them face to face. Now the rooms are basic if you get a room on the back side facing the river then its pretty quiet. The front of the hotel though is very noisy. Most rooms on the back will look out on Wembley. My room was cold one little storage heater simply wasnt enough. One pillow was supplied only. The shower was nice but the toilet didnt flush too well and the sink when emptying with water which took along time smelt very very bad worse then a toilet would smell in a bad situation. Towels were also in short supply. 3 days past and non were given out. In the end had to get some from reception. The card entry to the room is a joke as it doesnt work for longer then 20 minutes normally. So make sure you go to reception and get the room card redone when you arrive back in the hotel they blame it on mobile phones being next to the card but this isnt true as the card wouldnt work within 20 minutes which within it was nowhere near anything else. The general feeling is the hotel is worn. Have been told its getting a big refurbish but I imagine it will lose a lot of custom before then. Location wise its between Stonebridge and HangerLane. Both are between a 12  17 minute walk with Stonebridge being a left turn out of the hotel and then follow the road. You go under several rail bridges but this never felt unsafe as there was always other people about. Hanger Lane is abit of a harder walk. From the station getyourself on the main road right away then head left walk down to the park head to the underpass and then entrance 5 then walk you will see Travelodge in the distance on the left side of the road. All in all I would have liked somewhere alittle closer to the tube. But it all worked out ok in the end. Although I would not stay in this hotel again,bing1978
UR123980613,2012-1-February,1st Impressions Count FACT ! On approach I noticed the huge ugly steam spewing factory across the road as we arrived into the parking lot I noticed that directly behind the hotel was another horrendous 80s built and forgotten about factory with the very same name as the one I had just seen What a great idea build a Travelodge right in the middle the smell will hit and cling to the building on both sides !! The Entrance to the hotel or doss house it would be more aptly named was dirty surely mops and buckets dont cost that much in Wembley! You have to pass one of the corridors on your way to Reception the carpet that runs the length of the corridor had never been introduced to a hoover in its life Im pretty sure the flee bitten thing is about to walk to the nearest skip by itself. Reception were friendly enough and announced that we should be staying on the 4th floor. So we thanked them for the 60 seconds of their time and allowed them to get back to doing the crossword or whatever it was they were doing before we arrived. As we waited patiently inline for the lift (only 1 of the 2 working need i bother telling you and I have waited less time at theme parks for the rollercoaster) I noticed that all the other guests in the queue were male i then realised that they were all workmen and thought it odd that with so many workmen around the place was clearly in such disrepair (a lick of paint once a decade would certainly be an improvement) however it certainly explained why the carpets were full of cement and dirt from their dirty boots then i realised as we all trotted along the corridor and many of them staggering that they were in fact guests of the hovel. Trying to keep our spirits up we opened the door to the room took a deep breath and to my deepest joy and i nearly wept the bed was nice and clean the bathroom acceptable and oh what luxury there was tea and coffee making facilities. But wait there was a great big hole on the bathroom door that had been patched up by someone whos motto must be "Slap Dash earns the cash" same guy had filled in the many holes in the walls. The ceiling was decorated by what I guess must have been a glass of red wine flung with some abandon upwards and left there to dry in. We dumped our stuff and headed back down stairs to enquire about internet and the nearest petrol station. We were met with a whole flock of work men who were talking gingerly to their work mates who must have been given the day off and had spent their weeks wages in the pub. We were there for 30 minutes and it was like a YMCA men coming and going Brining in their Asda shopping(I didnt realise Travelodge has the option of self catering) making phone calls back home to their wives just to keep up the weekly tradition of arguing. Others on their laptops the rest just supping their drinks and staring into their glass. I was the only female I saw the entire time. We paid 25 pound so we weren't expecting the Ritz but we didn't want the YMCA either. Oh and did I mention that we had to pay for the parking in the hotels very own car park 5 quid for the pleasure. If I had know what this place was like I would have avoided it like the plague and happily paid more for a nice hotel. Take my advice don't think twice  Dont book here stay well clear !!!!!! SHUT THIS PLACE DOWN !!,Mzkarmb
UR127058665,2012-1-April,This will be short and sweet. Stayed for one night. Room no 7 Smelled like damp so we were moved. The hotel was not a good smell and was very old. Back breaking bed with plastic on the mattress. People who stay there must not be able to control their bladders. That said it is 2 miles from Wembley stadium. We stayed their on a Friday evening and took the 10 min walk to the tube. I am sure its not a safe area. HUNDREDS of bikers at the cafe there most seemed very respectable however there were blokes in vans and cars who did not seem so respectable. Could do with a massive refurb but to be honest its prob not worth it. So. for 20 its well worth it + 5 parking if your ok with a shed. Works for me at this price but would not spend anymore than 25!!! Enjoy :),adam1111_11
UR121569191,2011-9-December,I can't think of a hotel I've stayed in as bad as this. On approach it is hardly welcoming..the illuminated sign seems to have lost all but one bulb the entrance is very dark off a side industrial estate road. Location is against a very noisy road but we managed to get rooms at the rear so only had the noises of the AC units adjacent factory and side roads to contend with. The state of repair in the public areas is very poor stained carpets held together with gaffer tape unfinished decoration..very low standard. On arrival in the room I had to repair the curtains as one was hanging off one half of the shower enclosure was completely missing so a shower ended with water all over the floor the sink was blocked and more water leaked out of the back of the shower than came through the shower head. I went out for the evening and asked for the sink to be unblocked on arriving back it was still blocked but 2 towels had been taken - bizarre! Breakfast was poor orange'juice' that was water with the faintest hint of orange flavour - I didn't touch the buffet but my colleague was less than impressed. On the upside...comparatively low cost and the room itself was clean even if the general areas weren't nearest tube - 7 minute walk and 30mins right into the centre of London. Because of the standard of the accomodation and its proximity to a lot of industry it attracts a lot of Contractors. I think it also has some social Local Authority placements. You can only possibly give this hotel a good review if money is your only concern.,Andy T
UR117822020,2011-8-September,i work all around the uk and often stay at Travelodges as they offer good value for money and normally always clean and tidy. NOT THIS ONE. it is the worst Travelodge i have ever stayed at (and i have stayed in over 50 of them). please never book this 'hotel',MichaelNewcastleUK
UR119068768,2011-8-October,We spent the night here due to the location as we were travelling from south Yorkshire it was close to the M1 & to the tube to take us to Covent garden to the theatre. a last minute booking meant we couldn't check trip advisor for a review and what a mistake. It is at the side of the north circular surrounded by high security fencing. There is a 5 charge for 24 hour parking. It took 20 minutes to check in due to onemember of staff. It is shabby and in need of a complete redecoration and re-ferb. The carpets in places were held together with silver tape. The whole place was dirty. The "family" room was dirty and the bed side lights headboard & bed settee were broken. Again the carpets and bed settee dirty. The Tv only had one working channel and when reported was told it could not be fixed so we asked to be moved but were told there we no family rooms available but no alternative was offered. The all you can eat breakfast at 7.95 per adult was cold. Our first experience of travelodge and our last never again. It took nearly two weeks for the company to acknowledge our complaint email and offered 50% of our money back and an apology.,EvoJoan
UR120357574,2011-8-November,Frankly this property has gone downhill since it was a very nice express by holiday in. I have found the rooms to be dirty cold and smell. The beds are uncomfortable and sometimes not clean linen. The food has given me upset stomach on 2 occasions. The rooms facing the north circular are far too noisy. I have report various safety issues to the management and returned to the same room 6 months later to find the same issue. I have reported the issues to the council as they do not seem to be bothered. Awful place and i prefer to drive or train than stay at this poor overpriced place. I have had several refunds but on the last complaint they give me a vouchure that did not cover half the room fee. Stayed about 5 times in 2009 and 2010 and march 2011,ukfastltd
UR115160730,2011-8-July,We booked this hotel last year for Take That concert at Wembley Stadium this July. 120 for a twin room per night. A bit naively I thought all hotels in Wembley would be expensive due to the concert and high demand for rooms. I thought great I've booked a room and didn't look at reviews before booking:o( Just relieved that I had managed to book a room and wouldn't have to drive back to Bournemouth late at night. I sooo wish that we had done just that and driven straight home. Having booked the hotel room this was supposed to be an added treat and a break away with the prospect of a peaceful night sleep and an overdue lie in...... It was a hot day and in the main reception area there was air conditioning and nothing to make us doubt the hotel. However as soon as we got in the lift and went up to the 3rd floor the heat coming out the lift into our corridor was overwhelming. I thought we were in Spain. We found our room and went in to find room was unbearably hot and so noisy. Catch twenty two did we open the window which was filthy and at the front of the building overlooking 'motorway' and put up with the horrendous noise or shut it and feel sick with the heat. Oh and the curtain wasn't even hooked properly. No hairdryers... apparently they get nicked. 1 towel each. 1'slim' pillow. My bedside light fitting fell off when I switched it on to read. Missing lights on the wall. Soggy carpets. Pubic hairs in bathroom .Suspicious marks on the walls and ceilings??? However we went to our concert which thankfully was amazing. On return we both had a cool shower as was still soooo hot in the room (was 1am) and tried to relax to go to sleep. NO CHANCE!!!!!! The traffic noise was terrible (windows open in desperation!) 3.30am I was on tripadvisor on my moblie phone thinking is it me am I being unreasonable. Definitely not in fact reading the reviews on here made me more nervous and just reinforced my horrible gut feeling of the place.Cars being broken into and hotel doors being forced open was not light reading.I went down to reception in my pj's to ask for a fan and complain. NOTHING the guy just wasn't interested. Thankfully in the morning we checked out and we couldn't do that fast enough we complained again at the check out desk and a lovely receptionist just said she was sorry and that was that. I couldn't blame her personally but the hotel is a shambles. Someone has to take responsibilty. How can they carry on operating like this??? Our friends on the 7th floor had same problems as us and on top had the room next to theirs emptied because of 'BED BUGS' during the night. (Hotel staff had tried to open their door at 2am by mistake). Still we should be greatful because our car wasn't broken into and we left in one piece and got out of there!!!!!!!! Please please never go there!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,nicnacpad
UR95926461,2011-8-February,There is no security in the hotel. Strangers can easily make their way up to rooms and the cleaners seem to leave your door open when they have cleaned it. Anyone can get in and take anything. When you complain the staff take no notice and offer no further support. They won't even give you details of who to complain to as it's "not their policy" to give names and numbers out - or addresses! You can't email complaints via the website as that doesn't work you have to email via the contact page. When they eventually reply they do nothing to help. I'm now pushing this further up the complains system. In addition to this you should be aware that the secure parking area is not secure. The staff allow people to smoke in the rooms and the staff really do not care about the customers. I've staid in loads of travelodges and this has to be the worst experience I have had to endure - DO NOT USE THIS HOTEL!!!!!,Babbo001
UR115124167,2011-7-July,Please be warned.......My husband and I have stayed at this hotel several times in the past. As we have always used it as a last minute booking. Well last year we booked up in a month in advanced & spent 120 for a 2 nights and breakfast. I was in a accident and had to cancel the booking. Please bear in mind I had booked the insurance. UP to now 1 Year later I am still awaiting Travelodge to call me & received 1 email that they were looking into my problem. I have called several times for a refund. Now the last time I visited the hotel we had guests from USA. The chambermaid had stole her sun glasses the carpet was filthy and our room was double booked with a a guest trying to enter our room while we were sleeping at 2am!!! please please be warned. That the this is not a good or safe. Travelodge is a Conn. They do not accomodate disabled customers....plus we had a leaking toilet which did not get fixed the 2 nights we were there. Please please beware. I like to give praise when it is required but the standards are awful and filthy. Carpet is sticky like glue! PLEASE GO ELSEWHERE,Trace1102
UR116391409,2011-7-August,I myself work in hospitality....and if i was the manager of this hotel id be worried! Negatives - THE STAFF!!!!! wow....i have never been so ignored when entering a hotel. No smiles or hellos from any member of staff through our entire stay.... the gent and lady on reception was particularly unhelpful and uninterested. CHECK IN ISNT TILL 3pm!!.....if u want to check in they'll take half an hour to try and find a room...AND charge you 10!!..... PAYING for Parking!!......5 a day to put your car in their car park...rediculous...i was aware of this before arriving but still....the car park is joining the hotel surely something could be done for guests staying. NO phone in the rooms.... room was just about clean funny smell from the toilet THE NOISE!!!!.....wow...if u want to get a good night sleep i suggest bring heavy duty ear plugs or go soemwhere else. right on the main road...horrendous noise at the front of the hotel. room was dated and tv ancient. rooms incredibly hot...not even a fan offered! the windows open about 2 inches...then your faced with an even worse noise problem. considering all the down falls...i cant beleive how over priced it is. not even breakfast is included. thankfully we did not stay in the place long enough to sample the delights of their food. positives... hmm....relitivley close to the tube station 600 meters away. somewhat easy to find may i suggest travel lodge train their staff in customer services before letting them lose on the public. how hard is it to smile? im aware that the hotel is cheap and cheerful and we only wanted it for one night just to crash after the football. but the words cheap and naff come to mind more than cheerful!!,Robert_Stephens
UR117690849,2011-5-September,We booked into this hotel for one night myself my husband and our children (2 & 5 years old). Travelling down to London I searched online for the phone number to see if you could park our car there before check in upon searching I stumbled across this website oh how I wish I'd looked sooner! The reviews started to panic me but we decided to see for ourselves. We parked there and went into the hotel to book a taxi well the smell was awful very damp and there was a staff member walking around spraying air freshner. I will say the staff we spoke to were polite and helpful though. We went off for our travels round London we got the tube back to Stonebridge and walked to the hotel it was awful groups of people staring at us and then walked past a row of parked cars with their windows all smashed!! This was not a place we wanted our children staying in at all so we got to our car and drove away and book another hotel!! Yes it cost us more money but for comfort cleanliness and a car in one piece it was more than worth it! I have previously stayed in 2 different Travelodges which were fine but after this experience never risking it again!!!! Please read these reviews and book elsewhere its worth spending more money on a better hotel.,Laura F
UR102881403,2011-5-April,My girlfriend and I often use Travelodges as we like to travel round the country to visit various cities and attractions. Previously Travelodge have done exactly what we wanted a cheap clean place to leave our stuff and sleep. The staff are usually fine and we come away happy. However the Wembley site appears to be the black sheep in the Travelodge family. It cost 5 to park the car which normally I wouldn't be overly bothered about as it is located in a fairly less desirable area but all the gates were left open negating the security benefits. The receptionist didn't have a clue what he was doing did not use any common sense (we arrived 20 mins before the check-in the room was ready and we had to pay 10 to get into our room or wait other Travelodges have allowed us grace if we've been slightly early before). We also agree with another reviewers comments on the state of the foyer toilets the corridors and the room wasn't great albeit quite large. Also the TV didn't work which didn't help our feelings towards the place either. I think we'll probably try Travelodge again but stick to the more central ones as they are alot more reliable.,crackinbloke
UR117441411,2011-30-August,I booked this hotel for one night only as we were attending a leaving do in Wembley. It was an absolute mistake! I booked a family room for three. On arrival we were given a room on Floor 2. As soon as the lift doors opened on Floor 2 it stunk! A strong mouldy smell! It was sickening. We thought that perhaps in the room it would be better unfortunately it was not! The room was of poor standard bedsheet crumpled as if the room had just been vacated. The sink had no plug holes toilet seats stained the sofa bed was looked disgustingly dirty! We asked for another room and this time were directed to Floor 6. The mouldy smell was only a little less stronger the room looked a little bit cleaner but not to the standard! The sink taps were stained with soap foam again no plug hole in sink no protective lamp shade for the ceiling lamp all the wires were bare! When we used the shower previously written swear words appeared on the bathroom mirror! Proof of poor housekeeping! The walls were dirty and had the odd holes here and there! I was glad we stayed only a few hours in this hotel! The staff had a defensive attitude. The housekeepers looked scruffy. The carpets need to be replaced they did not sit flat (trip hazard) on the floors and they stunk. This hotel is a health and safety hazard and I would never recomend it!,None685
UR114991278,2011-3-July,This hotel is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. Unhelpful staff Broken lift Hot and Smelly rooms. The room had broken skirting boards and peeling paint. Window could barely be opened but even when closed Traffic noise was terrible. Even the TV had no remote control. Bathroom was unclean with built up limescale on shower door tracks Breakfast provision is pathetic you would be better off going to McDonalds.,vicster_11
UR95420441,2011-3-February,Having seen some of the reviews from this hotel i thought i needed to comment. i had stayed here once before so i needed a cheap hotel for 2 nights and this 1 was the cheapest having stayed there before i knew it was a way out of london and on the north circular so was on a non stop busy road and a 15 mins walk from the tube in an industrial area but the hotel is clean and ok. or it was on my last stay there seemed to be problems with crime rooms being broken into the police were there a few times during my stay (bit worrying)...... gangs of lads coming in and out of the main door n hanging round outside. any way on my second night i had no sleep and felt very scared as there was a lot of comings and goings from the room next to mine door banging every 5 mins yes i was timing it as the shouting and banging kept me awake all night. my lock was dodgy too so i was in bed with all my belongings just in case god only knows what was going on.the next morning the door to this room looked like it had been tampered with. i mentioned the goings on to the reception they didnt seem suprised. its a shame cos it is a nice hotel not in the best area but this has definately put me off and i would advise not to stay here.,gazburton41
UR101823226,2011-28-March,Less than 25m from the North Circular Road so very noisy foyer floors were dirty the foyer toilets were completely insanitary had no toilet paper and didn't look as though they'd been cleaned in over a month there were no plugs in any of the sinks the bed was uncomfortable (felt as though we were sleeping on a cliff - one false move and you fell off!) breakfast was cold the lift was out of order the carpets were badly wrinkled and a serious trip hazard some of them had been repaired with gaffer tape and some hadn't the room keys didn't work breakfast was cold some of the chairs in the bar were broken the cafe carpet wasn't hoovered between any of the meals so there was food debris left on the floor. Any good points? Well the staff were friendly and helpful but there just weren't enough of them. There was a queue of about 20 people at Reception trying to check in people wanting plugs for their sinks extra pillows etc and service at the bar but only ONE person serving! Enough said?!,hopkins_s2
UR110064135,2011-27-May,Not a bad hotel for the money but when we went to breakfast we daftly thought it would be safe to leave our bags and wallets in the room. BIG MISTAKE after 40 minutes at breakfast we returned to find two ten pound notes gone from my wallet and ten from my wife! Lad at front desk had asked us for our room number 3 times at breakfast despite it being on the breakfast voucher...suspicious! Same lad was no help and claimed no one but us could get in the room not even staff!!! Eventually rang police. Then suddenly the manager appeared and started using some machine to read our door. Sadly this machine couldn't be downloaded by anyone on duty at the time. Convenient! Absolutely convinced the staff are responsible. Disgrace,ramshackleruk

UR121046884,2011-26-November,I have previously stayed at a Travelodge in Edinburgh the one overlooking the Dean River based on the quality of the hotel there I had booked this stay at Wembley. I knew the location of the hotel which was on the North Circular Road so this was not a suprise the only good thing about the hotel is that there was no noise up on the 3rd floor where I was staying but other than that the stay was a huge dissappointment. The Receptionist on shift that checked me in was very polite... her name was Dimples and she was from India. She received me in a courteous manner chatted a bit and wished me a good stay. Then when I got to the lift area there were 2 lifts one out of order and second one that was on the 3rd floor. So I waited for it at first I was alone but soon I was joined by 2 maids that were deep engaged in conversation in a foreign language probably Polish but I can not be entirely sure. Even though I did say Good Afternoon to them I received no reply. When the lift opened up it was full of other maids and a laundry trolley/basket the maids that were waiting for the lift with me jumped in and left me waiting for the lift to return as there was no space for myself and my 1 piece of hand luggage. I waited for a while and decided to take the stairs. The staircase was far from a hotel staircase that is open to public even though there was a big sign indicating where they were. The staircase was made red steel and there was a smell of chemicals in the air. When I reached the room I could see that the main door must have been broken in at some point in the past and never was fixed as I could see the door frame with splinters sticking out just next to the lock and handle. The bathroom door had some holes in it that had been covered up with a white/yellow paste and was never repainted. The bathroom seemed clean and there were 2 half used toilet paper rolls. The room seemed clean and spacious we had booked a Family room for 3 and it seemed okish. The 3 pillows however where paper thin (when in Edinburgh the pillows where full and round and soooo comfortable I thought that thas was there standards I was wrong!). So I thought lets go down and let Dimples know I would need more pillows I jumped into the lift yipee and asked Dimples if she could keep a few spare pillows that I would pick up in the night to take to the room but she offered to place them in the room if she found some so that was a nice extra touch. In the evening I returned with my family and as soon as I got into the hotel I noticed a very strong smell of air freshner that was certainly not healthy for someone with Asthma like my mum who needed to reach for her inhaler. When we got to the room I found out that indeed they had left us another 2 paper thin pillows. The next morning we went out for the day and when we got back our key card was deactivated so I had to go down to activate it again then when we got to the room we saw that they had changed our towels but nothing else was done not even emptied our bins which were full. The following day we were getting ready at 9.30am and housekeeping started knocking on our door to service the room we asked for them to return in 15 minutes and all were literally forced to take the towels into the room. In the evening the key card was not working again even though it was in my bag where no mobile phone was kept and once in the room again no service was done not even the old towels were removed or toilet paper replaced which was needed. The same situation happened the following day and my family was even told that they were due to check out and to please leave the room but only to find out that they had make a mistake. One of the evenings we asked the receptionist if we could please print of an important document as we had an appointment at the Embassy in the morning and we had been unable to print off from Ryman (printer out of order) and then from the internet caf in Ealing (same reason) but we were told they could not insert any USB stick into their computers so we asked if they could print it off from e-mail and they said they only had access to their intranet so we asked if we could send it to their work e-mail and they said they needed approval from their managar that was only going to be there at 9am and our appointment was at 9.30 am at Holland Park so we would never have been able to make it. So no... I would NEVER reccommend this hotel horrible service no interest in helping guests whatsoever one of the lifts remained ouf of service for the entire stay and there was not even a sign there to apologize. I can not believe the difference between this Travelodge and the one I stayed in Edinburgh the one in Edinburgh was a place I would go back anytime and have recommended to everyone I know that was travelling there. So dissappointed with Travelodge Wembley!,yolianda1
UR115726737,2011-24-July,I have stayed here regularly for the last 3 years as it is next door to where I need to be the next day. After each visit Travelodge e-mail me and ask me to complete a questionnaire on my stay and for the first couple of years I bothered to do it and told them exactly what I thought. It has made no difference at all. To be fair the manager is lovely ( I have had many conversations with her over the last couple of years) and the staff try really hard with what they have got to deal with. Head Office should be made to come and stay overlooking the ring road every night for 2 weeks. They would do something about the hotel after 48 hours. I now know what to do and to take with me to ensure a good evening and nights sleep however I refuse to stay there if I have to pay over 50. Then I stay at a Premier Inn up the road. I have only managed to secure a night at the elusive 19 rate once. Otherwise I pay the 29 or 39 option. There is no way it is worth more than that. In the last year or more there has only been 1 lift working and there seems no sign that Travelodge can be bothered to do something about it. They have however replaced the corridor carpets on a couple of levels which has made a difference. Travelodge Head Office: Come and invest some money and give your staff a sporting chance of doing a good job. Top Tip: There is a really good Indian restaurant up the road at Hangar Lane and it's a 8 min walk up there but do not walk it if you are alone and female.,ED987654321
UR119629703,2011-23-October,I agree with all the recent reviews of this hotel we booked with Superbreak who normally have good quality hotels but I'm loding a compaint with them as I felt like walking out but as i'd paid up front we coudn't do that. I'd requested a quiet room but I don't think they have one the first room we were given was on the front of the buidling and the window wouoldn't shut properly so we asked to be moved we were moved to the back of the hotel whhich was better but a very shabby hotel in my opinion it needs knocking down and starting again luckily we just needed a base and a bed (but an expensive bed at that) we disn;t have a shower whilst staying due to the whole place feeling grubby.,ralanengland
UR118459171,2011-22-September,Me and two friends went to stay in this Travelodge and to be fair didn't expect much for rooms at 20.50 each. However we did expect clean and safe rooms. These were neither. I pre-booked these rooms in March this year for us to stay mid-September. Even though I booked half a year in advance our rooms were three floors apart. This would have been annoying but okay had my door felt secure ( I was in the room on my own my two friends being a couple and sharing) but the door felt loose. Not excellent when sleeping by yourself in a busy area of London.There were stains all over the walls and windowsills. The rooms smelt. The pillows were so flat they were pointless. The water from the sink smelt of sewage and there were no plugs. The showers flooded and were blocked as well as mouldy. The windows were so poor the noise from outside was overwhelming so made sleep impossible. I can honestly say I haven't been so disgusted with a hotel. The fact that Travelodge has now been featured on Watchdog for its horrendous standards just says it all. Don't bother with Travelodge!,LeahMarie2
UR117018344,2011-21-August,When I discovered we had been booked into the London Wembley Travelodge whilst looking for directions I noticed the reviews that other customers had placed both on the Travelodge website and on Tripadvisor; the overwhelming balance of comments was that the hotel was poor and should be avoided. However it was too late for us to change. When I arrived my fears to an extent were confirmed; the entrance and the one working lift was poor and when I went to the room I found that there was nowhere to hang clothes as the rails were missing graffiti on the bathroom door a taped over broken plug and most importantly a sofa bed which was to be used by my two grandchildren was not very clean and the bottom bed was missing. I immediately went to reception and spoke initially to the receptionist and then to the Hotel Manager. Initially they wanted us to change rooms but I didnt want to do this as it would separate us from my daughter and son in law and as we had a room at the back of the hotel away from the traffic noise there would be a risk on having a room at the front. We asked for z beds or simply a clean mattress to be placed on the floor and hotel manager said she would try to ensure that this was arranged. We then left to attend a wedding. 3 hours later we returned to check on progress and found to our satisfaction that 2 z-beds had been placed in the room. Contrary to many comments that we had read we found the staff that we came into contact with extremely helpful and they solved our problem. I think we had one of the better rooms judging by comments from some others in our party. The hotel is clearly not up to Travelodge standards and it needs a complete refurbishment. It is not in a good location  it is a run down industrial area right beside the North Circular road and therefore the front side of the hotel is subject to continual noise from traffic. It is also very hot  it is one of those buildings that holds the heat. However I found the staff to be excellent. They must get lots of complaints and the hotel manager in particular deserves a better hotel and probably a big pay rise for operating very effectively in very difficult circumstances.,Peter T
UR114520333,2011-20-June,I arrived on Saturday around 6pm to check in. I was given a room on the first floor. Upon arriving to the first floor there was a very heavy smell of alcohol throughout the hallway. I entered my room and could hear very heavy road noise (very loud) in my room. it would be impossible to sleep. The seal around the window was broken and hence the noise was not filtered. I went back to reception to advise and the reception person offered me a room on the 7th floor. I asked if it was away from the road on the back of the property and he said "no but its fine". Fine for who? in any case i went to the room. After i arrived upstairs (one lift not working so took around 5 mins to wait) the road noise was still intrusive. I was in a rush to get out of the hotel at this point since i had arranged a meeting so left the room and thought i would "make do". The next morning i had arranged to check out of the hotel at 12 noon so woke up at 11. I went to take a shower and low and behold there was no hot water. I left the shower running for a while and still nothing. At 11.15 there was a knock at the door "housekeeping!". I opened the door and the cleaning lady asked me " what time is checkout?". I said "you work here and you do not know what time check out is?". She shook her head. I said "12 o clock". I then said there is no hot water and she said "sorry go to reception". Deciding not to take the 7 minute trip downstairs i thought i would complain at checkout. I was obviously running out of time before checkout so packed my things and left. The man at reception asked me if my stay was ok and i said no. He didnt bother to ask me why. To say i am amazed as to how this hotel is run is an understatement. I had even asked for change at the bar for the car park and the person said there was no change available for parking. The sheer dilapidations and lack of concern for guests is crazy. I should have just paid the 5 to park in the car park and slept in my car. Would have been quieter and probably comfier. Avoid this hotel like the plague. Or visit the doctor after just to check you have been infected with something.,MichaelShah
UR118843945,2011-2-October,I Booked a family room didnt expect much for 58 pound but what we got was terrible. We were on the first floor everything looked fine untill we got out the lift the smell hits you like a ton of bricks. the carpets are awful and what makes it worse you can see the duck tape they have tried to stick it back down with. water stains all up the walls and a huge stain on the carpet skurting boards missing and gereral disperear. Well going into the room the smell of cheap shake and vac and mold was so strong made us all feel ill. Not long to our show we all got ready to take a shower and get ready my husband went to get the iron from front desk then being told he had to pay 10 pound deposit. When he brung it back to the room i could not believe he had paid a deposit for it the buttons were falling off the water top up hole had a crack in and the cord had tape around it I was scared to use it. When i complained to front desk i got a shrug and told it was the only one avalable. so go back up to have a shower to find the shower cubicle was moldy the sink had no plug the toilet didnt flush untill the 5th or 6th time . I got in the shower and went to close the door and would you believe it NO shower door/ shutter or curtain !!! so not wanting to be fined (as they make it clear if you break there rules you will be fined ) i get dressed and go back once again to front desk were i explain the man tells me there has been no reports off a shower door missing and wasnt even going to come and check so i asked if i could go on and have a shower and risk the floor getting wet which in turn made him call maintance to come and have a look a man came up and like it was a normal accurance said ok ill go and get a plastic sheet and make a shower curtain well im so shocked buy all this i would never ever go back to this hotel  there were so many things wrong with this hotel and im not the pickest of people its basic care of the hotel that is not even getting looked at . in short staff have no idea what they are doing or just get so many complaints they have stopped caring  it says 24 hour pizza thats a lie  there are no shops near buy  no shower door in my room no plugs in sink  bedside light missing moldy carpets rank smell through out made worse buy the smell of cheap damp carpet powder the sofa bed was stained . Outside looks like a prison the gaurds and staff block the exit talking to taxi drivers and friends iron is a death trap the best bit was breakfast because we were leaving ! Stay away if you want to enjoy your time in wembley .,Claira S
UR118325405,2011-19-September,Travelodge management need to get in here and shut the place down whilst they renovate the whole place. I agree that staff are pleasant enough but they don't have a handle on what they are doing. We booked two twin rooms last minute so we (or rather our company) paid through the nose. 260 for the four of us. If we'd paid 40 I might be less scathing about it but still wouldn't be giving a good review. Sadly it was London Fashion Week when we had need to be in London so our options were limited. The car park looks like something left over from the Cold War and the front of the building could be a prison with the barbed wire high fences and concrete walls. Despite being fully booked we managed to park easily although they charge you 5 per vehicle for 24hrs which seems somewhat outrageous! There is a cafe/bar here and the stench of stale cooking oil and grease that emanates from it out into the carpark is appalling. Empty beer kegs were stacked up by the wall. On entering my heart lifted slightly as the entrance was clean and tidy. The bar is reasonably stocked with alcoholic drinks of your choice and there is a wall with a number of vending machines - one for water one for cans of fizzy pop and two more for snacks and the essentials that you may forget like a toothbrush or toothpaste. Check in was straight forward albeit that the two rooms which were on the same booking were inexplicably split so that one was on the first floor and the other on the fourth. In to the lift (clean enough on first inspection but the floor is actually in serious need of a scrub on hands and knees - not a swab with a mop) and up we went. The door popped open on the first floor to let some people out and the stench of stale rotting carpet and furniture was atrocious. It smelt to me like there was a hot water leak somewhere (although that may actually have been because the whole place was overheated) which had permeated the carpets throughout the hallways and was now rotting the fixtures and fittings from the inside out. It was appalling. We carried on up to the fourth floor where the door opened to a normal clean-smelling hallway. Phew. The room was typically Travelodge basic which was perfectly normal and acceptable. The bathroom was reasonably clean but there was water damage across the ceiling from a recent looking leak. A clean single duvet on each bed and a solitary pillow about as thick as the palm of your hand. A card in the room said to ask at reception if you wanted another pillow. Other than that it was generally fine. The temperature however was awful. The heating was off but it was so stuffy that it was not bearable. The window only cracks open about two inches - no doubt to stop you throwing yourself out of it - so a breath of fresh air was impossible. The hotel is of course right on the Northern Circular which essentially means a motorway passing about 20 yards from the windows. We knew about this and had brought earplugs in preparation but you couldn't leave the window open to sleep. We left the window open as wide as we could (hardly at all!) and went out for the evening. On our return I asked at reception for a round of four pillows (one each) but was told that the hotel was fully booked so they had none left. I don't really care whether or not they are fully booked - they should have sufficient bedding for each room. I then tried to get a bottle of water from the vending machine - completely empty. The bar do not sell soft drinks except as mixers. My only option for a soft drink was to pay 1 for a can of diet coke from another machine which was lukewarm. My colleague then asked to buy a toothbrush as she'd forgotten hers and was directed to another machine. It was also empty. On asking again at reception she was met with shrugs. On asking who was responsible for filling the machines they shrugged again. A staff member then retrieved a packet of peanut M&M's and gave them to her by way of apology for being out of pillows water and toothbrushes. It was a nice gesture I'm sure but I cannot see how it remotely related to the issues we had at that point! On going to the first floor in the morning to collect our colleagues on the way out I was appalled to see the volume of wanton damage that has not been repaired and lack of care and attention by the hotel management. There were a number of fires that had been set at some point up against doors and walls damaging both the doors and the carpets. There were horrific looking stains on the carpets that could have been either vomit or faeces judging by the colours. The carpets were lifting up and are filthy - I suspect that the water damage you can smell is linked to the carpets moving around like hair in a Timotei advert. The Ace Cafe (of motorbike fame) is a few minutes walk away and well worth a visit in my opinion! Stonebridge Park tube and railway station is about fifteen minutes on foot from the hotel and the Bakerloo Line will take you straight into the city centre in 29 minutes. I will be writing to the hotel management to complain and more or less C&P'ing my review in the letter. The brand has a reasonably good reputation for good basic clean standardised facilities. I've stayed in 6/night B&B's in Sri Lanka with considerably better quality fewer stinks and better service. This hotel is a disgrace to the chain.,old_fashioned_chair
UR119469965,2011-19-October,I'm not even sure where to start! Dont try and check in early as they have no idea whats going on or how to do it. We had to turn up early on the offchance we could. -Pay and display parking -Not enough pillows & towels -Maid walked in our room while we were sleeping -Our floor stunk of drugs -Rubbish staff -Security knocking on our door late at night -The people opposite were thrown out -Dirty and gruby -SOOOOOO noisy! I could go on! I might not have minded if cost 30 but 75???,Sam A
UR120733271,2011-18-November,Having never stayed in a Travelodge before I was expecting basic but at the very least clean. Upon arrival I found out I was mistaken. We checked in and went up to our floor but no sooner had the elevator doors opened when the smell hit you ... damp and disgusting. The carpets were revolting in the hall (I honestly cannot imagine what had happened to them) and weren't much better in the room. The room was dank and the windows looked like something out of a prison. They were also so thin you could hear the street noise just as well as if you were standing outside. I got lliterally no sleep that night. I'd booked a twin room for two people yet we were provided only one bath towel. The breakfast the next morning was basic and I could have had something better and cheaper from Garfunkel's. All in all the "hotel" was essentailly something from my worst nightmare - if I hadn't left my credit card at home I would have checked out and traipsed London 'til I found somewhere else to stay. I would love to know where they film their adverts because it is most certainly false advertising. I will never stay in a Travelodge again and would reccomend you DO NOT STAY HERE!,Natalie M
UR114179768,2011-18-June,The first thing we noticed having checked in and gone up our room was urine in the toilet and a greasy mark (most probably urine) on the floor infront of the toilet! The whole bathroom did not look clean (this was unacceptable) so we immediately went to reception to complain. A member of staff agreed to look at the problem was shocked to see the bathroom in such a condition apologised and explained that the cleaners are from a seperate company and it is not hotel staff that clean the rooms. I think you would agree this is not an acceptable excuse! We were offered a different which initially looked much better and the bathroom was cleaner. However soon after he left us in the room we noticed it was very noisy and cold the window would not close. As if this wasn't enough of a problem the lights around the bed and on the wall did not turn on and on inspection did not have lightbulbs in! There was only one light near the door that did not light the area near the beds. Once again we complained the same employee came up to see the room and then explained that there were no other rooms available for us to move into. We ended up going back to our original room as he offered to clean the toilet. It was gone midnight by now and the only saving grace was going to be a cup of tea.. But oh no there was no kettle/tea/coffee equipment! We spoke to one of the managers in the morning who noted that it has only recently become a travelodge and was still at the standard of a 'premier inn'. Once again absolutely no excuse. We have since recieved a full refund but we will NOT be returning to this travelodge again.,Rap27
UR115473362,2011-18-July,I booked this hotel through work as we had a early morning conference. The rooms were terrible stains in bathrooms no plugs (for the men to shave in the morning) and a drainage problem in the shower. The food was fried to death and the batter was a dark brown. The hotel was dirty. I can honestly say the place needs to be shut down. I made a big mistake of looking through the kitchen window.. big mistake. The next day I had really bad stomach spasms. Im sure it was due to the disgusting state of the hotel. I took photographic evidence and will be taking this further.... DONT STAY HERE!,MissBitez
UR115411852,2011-16-July,My stay was for three nights and by god I couldnt wait to get homethe food was unsightly and their were more people ordering in from the local takeaway than ordering of the hotel menu.the room key card never workedand when you finally get into your room you are met with no pillowstowelsfilthy windows were the previous occupies had taken their time to write their names into and a damp stained roof.the noise of traffic was unbearableand the view of a stinking food factory pumping out god knows what out of its chimney and the heat at night especially on the upper floors was just to much.the staff didn't want to knowand were very rude.the secure parking costing 5 a night and had no choice other than to pay or be clamped was a waste of timeas a van was broken into while I was there.all in all this hotel needs knocking down and rebuilding elsewhere.I'm writing this while tucked up in bed with the fluI beleive I caught from this short stay in the travelodge Wembley.my advice is to stay at the premier travel in up the road and cheaper.,Darby09
UR116827830,2011-16-August,I have stayed at Travelodges around the country before but this one was absolutely awful. The chairs in the "restaurant" were filthy. The staff were impolite unhelpful and unresponsive. The bed linen was not changed once in our week stay. Would never stay in a Travelodge again sticking to PremierInn in future.,RRTaylor
UR108344211,2011-15-May,Other reviews have said it in more words so I'll summarise: Many facilities out of order (with 'witty' signs to supposedly make you feel okay about it) dirty rooms with no creature comforts charges for parking in an insecure car park no facilities to leave luggage charging for Wi-Fi (for 100 per night?!?). All you are paying for is the location (quite) near to Wembley Stadium and even the area itself is a dump. After this stay I wrote to Travelodge who offered no remorse or acknowledgement that the standards of this hotel are utterly unacceptable. To repeat: Do NOT stay here!,keyboardsgray
UR115394981,2011-15-July,I stayed at this hotel recently out of desperation all other hotels were fully booked. The hotel was dirty the shower smelt of sewage the wallpaper and fixings were ripped and the atmosphere stunk food from the nearby catering/food processing businesses. The ONLY thing I enjoyed was the bed- I slept in it like a baby (quite unusual for me to enjoy a hotel bed). I am afraid can not recommend this hotel.,Baleng1986
UR115315137,2011-13-July,Hence the title I booked this hotel in wembley NOT the case!

UR115299451,2011-12-July,Stayed at this hotel thinking the usual standards of the Travelodge brand would apply how worng was I! Rude Staff run down shabby and stuck in the middle of a extremely run down part of Wembley. Rooms very worn noisey due to the main road and extremely hot if you were after a decent nights sleep then dont stay here. The noise was unbearable even with the windows closed but then the room would be too hot. So had no other choice but to try to sleep with the window open and listening to my ipod to drown out the road noise. Mugs provided were dirty and needed to be washed before use sink was cracked only very thin pillows provided toilet seat and flush were both hanging off and curtains werent even hooked up properly. Also had a very odd smell about the place. Not worth the money and will never stay there again! Travelodge should sell it on and turn it in to a prison!!,dbpeacockb
UR120428865,2011-10-November,Having stayed in several travelodge in the past for short city visits and with no other options available I booked in for a week at Wembley travelodge for a business visit to London. After checking in I noticed the wash basin was clogged and waste pumbed back in to the sink when I opened the tap. I reported this at the reception which then got cleared. This did not stop the issue and every time I open the tap it continued. The bathroom was in a filthy condition and even after reporting to reception every morning on my way out I found the room not cleaned and by the second day I could not stay there any more. Having paid for the week in advance I was told I could not get a refund. The hotel is at least 15 mins walk from the nearest tube station with no restaurants near by other than the hotel's restaurant. The menu had no good option and I am almost positive the food was made from frozen packs and not cooked. This was the worst ever stay. After a tiring day all that is needed is a good meal and a good bed this hotel didnt have either.,rak k
UR107631891,2011-10-May,Ok it was cheap but by that I only mean that it didn't cost a great deal. I could rent you my tent for 50 per night and that wouldnt be cheap! The door to the room looked like it had been kicked in at least once the mattress had been stolen and replaced with a sheet of plywood covered in a white sheet and there were unknown fluids sprayed across the ceiling which looked suspiciously like blood.,Mcscooby
UR112548012,2011-10-June,My boyfriend and I stayed here for a week while waiting to move into our flat. We had previously lived up north but had secured London jobs so we using the hotel until we could move. The area is dodgy. Leaving the tube station you're hit by a depressing industrial area and pass a biker cafe which never has less than 40 or so bikers hanging around outside which is intimidating to say the least. The hotel itself is fenced in like a prison and uninviting. Checking in took a good 20 minutes as there was a queue - 3 staff we at the desk but only one was bothering to check anyone in. After finally checking in we took the lift (which felt like it was about to break down as we arrived on our floor - expected the doors to open with the floor at chin level!) to our floor. The key card didn't work. We went downstairs to complain and they simply took the key and re-activated it without saying a word! The key continued to stop working EVERY day we stayed there and each time the staff were unhelpful. I suggested that perhaps there was a problem with the door and was completely ignored! Our room smelt like smoke with the smell coming from behind the bed. We assumed it was the room next door however when we left for work the next morning we realised that the 'room' next door was actually a cleaner's store room. Clearly the staff ar exempt from the smoking ban in this hotel. We left the 'do not disturb' sign on the door each day when we were out as we did not trust the staff not to steal our belongings while we were at work. Being so close to the north circular the noise is constant. After a while you do stop noticing it but light sleepers would not get on well here. Especially as the mattresses are solid and only 2 thin pillows are provided. When we asked for more we were told that there were none and that if they found some they would send them up. We never received any. On top of this the hotel is a good 15 minute walk from any shops and the route to them is not one that I would walk alone especially not in the dark. Fortunately we stayed in summer with the light mornings and evenings if we'd stayed in the autumn/winter it would have been even more of a disaster. The room was a good size (but not the biggest) and if you were only here for one night arrived late and left early it would probably be bareable... the curtains were hanging off the wall and the lights continually turned themselves off. We stay at travelodges quite a lot and know that this is not the norm for the chain. Overall we were extremely disappointed with this hotel and would not come back. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone that I hoped to continue a friendship with.,rhiannon1988
UR110873086,2011-1-June,Musty smell in room our window didn't open !!!! Stayed here a few years ago and it was ok but seems really run down this time,Jus1969
UR67013595,2010-9-June,stay away sleep on the streets instead this hotel in dirty the staff are more interested in all the companted rather than the people waiting to compain sounds daft but true also its a good 20 mins walk to the tube in a realy dodgy area.,oldbag1612
UR74435292,2010-9-August,not good. everything just a bit grubby and in need of renovation. Location pretty poor as well. finger and water marks all over the walls; hole in the wall filled with sugar packets; toilet old and stained; shower mouldy; lamp missing....,lovelyharry12
UR60852349,2010-9-April,We booked this as a last minute online all looked nice and new until we got there. Place was dirty not all the lifts worked and the rooms were no better. First room even had broken beside lamps and a window that wouldn't shut. Second room was somewhat better but lacked basics like a sink plug - at least it was on the sixth floor and quieter as it was on the back of the hotel - forget the front traffic noise is bad This hotel hasn't been maintained everything is either broken or in need of repair and most of all it is just plain filthy,PeterMcLK
UR82636071,2010-8-October,Broken car window glass litters the area not only around the perimeter of but also inside the car park compound. After checking in I took my luggage to the room that I had been allocated. The room was on the sixth floor overlooking the North Circular; the window wouldnt close it would have been impossible to sleep with the noise coming from the road and factory opposite. I returned to reception and requested another room. Following that I left the hotel to walk to Hanger Lane Tube Station to buy my travel ticket for the next day. Upon my return to the accommodation two men were fighting on the steps to the entrance. The police became involved; it was an aggressive and violent incident. Following my evening meal more police officers arrived and publicly arrested another couple and carried evidence bags through the communal area along with the arrested individuals who were cuffed. A building contractor to whom I was speaking advised that I should move my car to the front of the hotel as the duty security guards wouldnt take any preventative action should damage occur to any of the vehicles they were too scared. I followed his advice. He also mentioned that during the week that he had already stayed prostitution and overt drug use was commonplace. Whilst I was in the caf I overheard two other guests leaving for another hotel with complaints over the safety and general atmosphere and cleanliness of the Wembley Travelodge. At this point (8.30pm) I retired to my room to do some work. At 9.30pm I undressed for bed and attempted to chain the door. I was unable to. The door frame and lock had been completely split. I did not notice this when I originally checked in. I was moved to 3 other rooms. Each had their problems the bathroom doors kicked in the shaver plugs in the bathroom smashed windows broken. I eventually settled for a twin room in a corridor smelling strongly of cannabis smoke. I didn't sleep at 4am I heard a commotion outside I looked out and the police were there again. I feared my car had been smashed up. The next morning I went to reception and there were blood splatters on the floor....... Avoid this hotel - at all costs!!!!!,Tecnos
UR82144673,2010-5-October,On arriving to this delightful establishment we discovered that we had to pay to park so enquired at reception and was told it costs 5.00 to park for 24 hours and to pay at the machine outside reception. The machine only accepted coins which is fair enoughonly having notes on us we asked for change at reception which is not unreasonable and we were told that change is not available due to them not having any basically. We ended up having to pay by card which costs an extra 30p and took over 10 miutes to sort. Having got to our room we were met by the usual flat pillows on the bed mattress springs almost poking through and a wooden plank fitted to the wall in place of the absent full length mirror! On showering the tray filled with water almost instantly and ended up spilling onto the bathroom floor every time i moved in the shower so had to soak up with the 2 towels issued and had to ask for more at reception. Now dinner time.... My wife and i played safe and ordered bacon cheese burgers and chips we were told that they had no cheese so we ordered the montery jack cheese and bacon cheese burgers and a side order of onion rings. The burgers came out  one was ok and how it read on the menu but one was missing the cheese and the bacon and our side order of onion rings had turned into a bowl of chips! Having sent the wrong burger back it came back out with the bacon but no cheese again it went back and third time lucky we had our burgers sorted along with the onion rings. On requesting salt for our chips we were given what i can only describe as a medicine 5ml/10ml thimble of salt (which was still on our table the following day at breakfast )pudding however was ok difficult to cock this up though as was a slice of catering chocolate ice cream bash pre cut and straight from the freezer! Breakfast.....Started with cereal which again was a safe option but the warm milk on offer ruined that idea.The cooked breafast was just sat in the ban-marie drying up and the scrambled egg would have bounced off the floor if i had dropped my plate.The beans were ok as difficult to cock this one up too. On speaking to staff during our stay they really did struggle to grasp the english language which i find concerning due to their customer facing roles.,ACaiels
UR86041884,2010-5-November,My first room had a broken toilet seat and shower. My second room had a bad fume type smell and was juat as dirty as the rest of the hotel. wwhen I said about the smell I was told all the rooms small like that. The elevators struggled to open their doors and the communal hallways had the carpet stuck down with packing tape. There was a large wet patch in the hall that just seamed to get wetter it squeltched under foot. But Fiasal one of the staff was great and very friendly - all I can say is he really was a credit to the hotel.,Normady
UR73756440,2010-4-August,The outstanding manager Deepak is really up against it in trying to keep this hotel running. They've been promised inward investment from Travelodge HQ in anticipation of 2012 but the upshot of that is that until then it is going to remain a noisy dirty ill-equipped hotel in a rough location (15 minute walk to Stonebridge Park Tube Station).,EmmaRew
UR65831907,2010-30-May,what a joke for a hotel. I wouldn't let my dog sleep there. The place was a disgrace. Our first impression was the lift with the word 'dump' wrote on it - what a welcome. We then got to the room where my feet became stuck on the carpet as it clearly had not been cleaned since the sixteenth century. The toilet roll had hair stuck to it and the sink was blocked with manky water. The bed was another story - although we clearly love each other we couldn't sleep as we kept rolling together into the middle of the bed. When we lifted the sheet off the mattress in the morning I can only describe it as centuries of sweat dirt and wee!! The spy hole which I thought was there as a security measure was filled in with chewing gum - explain how that made me feel secure. Once again you live up to our expectation that the north is truly better than the south. Although we knew it was of a basic standard I did expect a level of basic hygiene which as you can imagine from reading this we did not get it. We went down for breakfast at 8am and by 8.15am there was no orange juice left - all I can assume is the rats had drank it! Do not stay here ever!!! Wembley Park tube station is much more appealing.,NorthMancs
UR85313156,2010-29-October,It's a bit scruffy very noisy (outside) and best of all it's not even in Wembley. It's located right on the busy North Circ road between Wembley and Hangar Lane a 10 minute walk from Stonebridge Park tube station on the Bakerloo line.,NottinghamRock
UR81371903,2010-28-September,On arriving at the hotel it was evident that it was in need of a major refurbishment. The carpets in the corridors were shabby and stained the lifts were slow and filthy and the metal stairs were grubby and sticky from spilt drinks etc. On entering the room (324) it was evident that cleaning and maintenance wasnt a top priority in this hotel. The bathroom wasn't as clean as I would have liked the shower was blackened with mould and there was a big crack running down the centre of the sink. When we decided to head to bed we realised that the window in the room wouldnt fully shut. This was bought to the attention of the staff at reception who told us that there were no other rooms available because the hotel was fully booked that night. So our only option was to spend the night with the duvet cover over our heads in order shield ourselves from the draft coming in through the window. As you can imagine the next day we awoke feeling worst for wear and with a head cold. My friends who were staying in rooms 205 and 206 were kept up all night by a neighbouring room which seemed to have 7+ people staying in it. They were playing load music slamming doors shouting/talking loudly and smoking cannabis in the room and in the corridor all night. After numerous complaints to the room and four trips downstairs to make complaints to the hotel staff on the front desk it was 7.30am before they were finally asked to leave the hotel. I thought that there was no way this hotel stay could get any worse sadly I was wrong! We checked out of the hotel at midday the next afternoon and walking to the car (which was in the hotel car park for which I had paid 5!) we realised that the passenger side window had been smashed and the car had been broken into. We went back into the hotel and were handed the phone to contact the police. When we asked if any other cars had been broken into we were told that a total of three cars (including mine) had been targeted. The hotel staff did not appear to be surprised in the slightest! With a 106 mile journey ahead of us and no call-out services available to put even a temporary fix on the window we found the hotel staff (including the manager) to be absolutely useless. In the end we left the hotel with a makeshift window made from cling film (which we had to go out and purchase ourselves after being told that the front desk staff/manager had no access to kitchen) plastic bags and cello-tape. Upon my return home I read reviews about the hotel on tripadvisor only to discover that all of the above (including cars getting broken into) happens on a regular basis and nothing much is ever done about it!,shardaymc
UR68920717,2010-28-June,It seems like this hotel was last decorated in Victoria's day and cleaned before she was born. I personally found the staff helpful. Perhaps you get what you pay for so if your happy to pay 56 for dirty carpets unimaginative decor smelly toilets and a grime ridden shower enclosure go ahead and book now.,ericoboogie
UR65457440,2010-27-May,Had the misfortune of staying in this hotel recently for the Eng vs. Mexico match. It was dirty and old. You certainly get what you pay for here... We walked into the main reception only to be greeted by two members of staff that acted like they couldn't care less. My main problems with this hotel: - The lifts were slow and only one was working. - As I sat down on the bed for the first time I ended up on the floor as legs were missing. The bed was also broken underneath. - There was only 1 towel for 2 people in a double room. - There was only 1 pillow on a double bed I went downstairs to ask for more only to be told that there was only one left. I was offered towels as replacements?? - Good job I needed them anyway. Also as the guy on the front desk went into the back to retrieve my towels I could clearly see ample pillows on the top shelf... - Toilet paper was never restocked; I had to ask for more. - Dirty Tea cups were left in our room from previous guests. - The window was broken and wouldn't shut properly being as we were facing the North Circular I had to jam a glass bottle between the handle and the frame to close it securely. The area isnt the best but Ive seen worse. However we managed to walk to and from the stadium at night which is a good 45mins away. There is also Leisure Park with lots of restaurants cinemas bowling gym etc.. a short 5min drive away in Acton. Other than the hotel being a huge downer we did manage to a have a fantastic time in London. If you're planning a visit I would recommend you stay elsewhere. I will next time.,ducknffc
UR77155721,2010-27-August,We booked up for 2 nights for a couple of days in London. We arrived to check in and found the staff ok but not very welcoming. Made our way to the room the carpets were damp and it smelt. Our room was ok sheets were clean but only one towel for two people in the room and one pillow each which was about the thicknees of a Rizla paper. The road outside was very busy and was quite noisy this didnt bother us that much but for alot of people this would probably be a problem. Around the hotel there is not alot no shops around the nearest shop is probably about 15-20 minute walk along the busy North Circular Road. We tried the food at the hotel was like rubber and quite expensive the carpets in the restuarant were heavily stained and the condiment holders were greasy from people who had used them before there was also lots of wrappers and rubbish on the floor. At 10pm I asked at reception for two extra pillows the lady at the desk said someone wil bring them up to our room 2 hours had passed still no pillows so we had to go back down to ask for them. Whilst downstairs we wanted a drink from one of their FIVE vending machines in receptionwe asked for some change for a 10 note but reception said no they have none (but i could clearly see there was bags of change in there) the next day we decided to take a walk only to spot a man not far from the hotel having a wee by the side of the road in broad daylight we walked about 30 minutes to Acton which has a Pizza Hut Cinema KFC etc. Stonebridge Park underground station is about 30 minute walk aswell. Nothing very cose by. We didnt have a very good experience here and reading some other comments neither did alot of other people.If i had paid 19 a night i would have put up with it but at 49.50 a night i expect better. Having stayed in many Travelodges in the past i didnt bother to read up on the hotel before booking as i thought Travelodges kept all their hotels to the same standard cheap clean and plesant but that is obviously not the case. Travelodge Wembly is run down badly run and could do with a huge facelift and cleaning throughly. This hotel really puts TRAVELODGE'S name to shame!!!,rosexx88
UR62291606,2010-24-April,This is a budget hotel. It only exists because of its proximity to wembley and many come for a cheap overnight stay near to the stadium. The trouble is: Approximately half the hotel the front side is plagued by unbearable road noise and it really is bad. The back is fine. The hotel is also set in an industrial estate on the north circular and beware that from the 5th floor you can see into some of the factory windows so I guess they can see you too! Pillows are wafer thin indeed so take you own! The state of repair is really bad already mentioned by many on here! The place needs a proper refurb. It is the worst travelodge I have seen. There are some good ones and and this is a real let down. A lot of the rooms have problems and we actually stayed in three different rooms during our visit because each one had problems like no hot water no curtains (sellotaped remnants only!) etc. Each time we complained we were actually offered one of our previous rooms again and I knew nothing had been fixed as it was the weekend when no repairs took place. There is also only one working lift for the 7 storey building as the other one has been awaiting repair for some time. It can be a long wait at busy times. The car park is not safe. Cars get broken into there. It is about 10 mins walk to the nearest tube. Stonebridge park should be avoided at night. Hangar lane is slightly further but safer as it is a bit busier. The walk is alongside the north circular past several factories and it is not pleasant. Oh and the smell of cannabis smoke on most floors and even the non smoking rooms! When there is a problem the worst thing is you have call an 0845 number from your mobile to speak to reception (no internal phone around) and the only solution is to change rooms which we did twice which is a pain as you can't ever properly unpack. The first time we moved they shifted our things for us but managed to lose one of my shoes in the process so we did it ourselves the second time. I went to reception a couple of times about this as I had no other formal shoes and you get responses like 'we'll check'....'yes we found it didn't we return it?'....'the cleaner should have put it in your room'....etc and eventually someone handed it to me from behind the counter on my penultimate day! Complaining falls on deaf ears. I have yet to hear from Travelodge HQ....when you google them they don't appear to have much customer service anyway! All in all you will be ok if you get a room at the back and everything works in the room. If also you pay a rock bottom price I guess this is where good reviews will come from. But otherwise avoid or be prepared to stay in several rooms until you get a good one. You have been warned!,kalupukka
UR71787668,2010-21-July,This hotel is filthy and smelly the staff are rude and not very helpful. We booked for three nights and only stayed one nobody slept the night we were there and none of us were brave enough to get into the beds. the showers have mould growing up the tiles you feel dirtier when you get out of it than what you did going in my advise is to avoid this hotel like the plaque.,MICHELLEMARY38
UR80316670,2010-20-September,We booked this hotel in advance online and paid 19.00 for the night before we had read the reviews. We had tickets for a concert in Hyde Park on Sunday evening and were due to be up north the following day so for us we wanted somewhere to stay where we could park the car get the tube into town and be back on the M1 easily early Monday morning. So we arrived expecting the worst. Yes there was only one curtain at the window no plug in the sink a bedside lamp missing and being on the north circular it was noisy. However the sheets were clean the shower was powerful with plenty of hot water and the staff were friendly. Our stay was satisfactory for one night it served our purpose. It seems to me people are expecting luxury at a Travelodge (albeit paying online superdeal prices eg 19.00 per night). To us at that price we can manage for one night as long as it's clean. Just stay at this hotel with a broad mind we did.,whitbylover33
UR53961071,2010-20-January,I stayed in this hotel as other friends were booked in here. I was attending a concert at Wembley Arena. I arrived at the hotel to see that it looked very tatty from the outside. On the jouney to my room I noticed the walls of the corridors were dirty with wallpaper peeling and dirty stained carpets. On entering my room I noticed there was a damp stain on the wall and peeling wallpaper. The bed looked slightly uneven and on lifting the sheet saw the bed was wedged with a pieve of wood and on lifting the sheet noticed a dirty worn blanket over the matress which had pieces of foam poking out of it. The room was very noisy the traffic roaring from the North Circular Road. I checked in this hotel and checked out 15 minutes later. I can honestly say this is the worst hotel I have ever seen. Do not even think about booking a stay here!,Nickelbackfan
UR85701588,2010-2-November,We stayed here on a Sunday night following the NFL game at Wembley the same day. This Travelodge is AWFUL - And nothing like any other Travellodge I have stayed in. The place was old tired and just dirty. It was in a horrid and run down area. The staff were totally unhelpful. We arrived early and hoped to be able to check in. At first attempt we were told no. (Kind of expected as we were several hours early but had driven a long way). We asked about parking - we were told we could park in the car park for 5. The machine only takes cash - we had notes - asked for change and were told no. We decided to go into London for a couple of hours. The nearest tube (Stonebridge Park) is a good 10 minute walk through a pretty run down abandoned and generally horrid area! It takes 30 mins on this to get into London. At 2pm we came back and hoped to check in (1 hour early). We waited for ages whilst the same man told 2 lads infront of us they weren't allowed to check out and leave any luggage at the hotel whilst they went out. During this time I particularly enjoyed watching the other woman behind the desk ignore the growing queue and also the 3 members of staff SITTING on chairs around the snack machine having a jolly good time watching people come in and out of the hotel!! He then told us again no we can't check in we're too early for the room. But then a few minutes later declared if we paid him 10 we could in fact have a room!!! I hope you can guess what my response was!! We left our belongings in the car and went to the match - which was brilliant by the way!! Later that night we tried to check in again.....Now a new person told us we had already checked in so must have a key and can't check in again!!! I think you can get the point. These people running this hotel are incompetant. difficult unhelpful and rude. Not to mention horrifically slow...try queuing for a drink at the bar! When we eventually got a room it was really basic. Not enough towels no floor mat for the bath room making that a death trap once one person has had a shower. Not even a sniff of any toiletries and also no hair dryer. Breakfast was ok but you sit in a dirty area. I was so happy to be leaving the next day. I stayed in the Holiday Inn the night before in Watford and this seemed like a 5 star hotel in comparaison to this hell hole! (bearing in mind this was also more expensive than the Holiday Inn. i know Travelodge is supposed to be budget value - but for he prices charged here it should be better. Other budget chains are FAR FAR superior). If you are visiting London my advice is definitely choose something like the Holiday Inn at Watford and avoid this area at all costs. If you have to come here as you are visiting Wembley as we did check out other options first. This should be your last choice!! There is a Premier Inn a Holiday Inn and a Crowne Plaza further up the road by Hanger Lane Tube (hopefully these can offer better!),PetulaB
UR84133668,2010-19-October,We have stayed in the Wembely Travelodge twice now when going to events at Wembeley stadium. We booked the room for 49 so didn't expect much for that price. The rooms were basic but not immaculately clean. We noticed the floors hadn't been hoovered very well and there was dust around the edges of the rooms. No problem with the bathroom though. The staff were average not very helpful. We had some food there one night which again was average but I didn't expect much more from hotel chain food. It took us about 40 minutes to walk back from wembely stadium on the night and a few people seemed to have the same idea as we did staying a bit further away from the stadium to save some money. It is a 10 minute walk down to the train station and about 20 minutes on the train into central London so handy for a day in the city too. It's convenient and cheap OK for one night but wouldn't want to go for a long weekend here!,treacle1234
UR53864450,2010-19-January,Booked this hotel because it was really cheap. Have stayed at Travelodges before but wish I had read the reviews before we booked this one. The first room we were given had a curtain that only partly covered the window. We asked for another room and the staff were very nice and obliging. The second room looked OK at first glance. We only saw the cobwebs when we returned late at night. The noise from the lifts was horrendous and the state of them (banana skin dirty pool of yellow liquid!!!!).was worse. We chose not to eat or spend any time other then sleeping (or trying to) in the hotel. The area is extremely run down and we felt quite unsafe. Won't be recommending this one to our friends/family.,RoseWestYorkshire
UR83740972,2010-16-October,"It was filthy smelly and generally disgusting. There was what looked like vomit on the carpet of the first floor outside the lifts and the corridor smelled awful. In my room the light above the shower didn't work the bedside light didn't even have a bulb in it - and needless to say the switch couldn't be reached from the bed anyway. The vending machines in reception didn't work. Waiting times to be seen at reception were awful. In the morning one of the lifts was out of order and the stairs were dark and dank and dirty. I won't ever stay there again and my faith in Travelodge as a chain has taken a serious hit. I won't be staying in a Travelodge again unless I've run out of all other options (including a tent!). ",JJSET
UR87317841,2010-16-November,I stayed here on business for one night only in October. The room was booked for me by a supplier and did not cost me anything but believe me I would not stay here again if I was paid too. Check in was reasonably efficient but I was a little taken aback that even as a guest I had to pay 5 to park a car for the night I would get fined if I didn't pay. I went up to the room and I am told I was lucky to be on the rear of the property as the front is so noisy with traffic. The room was dirty and all the furniture should be on a bonfire. There was a sofa bed that was so stained I wasn't entirely happy to put my suitcase on it (I certainly wouldn't sit on it and god help anyone expected to sleep on it) The bedside tables and dressing table all had ciggarette burns on them! (How long is since smoking was banned in hotel rooms?) the carpets were dirty There was a curtain track inside the window and a seperate one outside the window frame normally you would have curtains on the outside and liningsblackout fabric on the inside however bizzarely the curtain on the left was hung on the outside track and the curtain on the right was hung on the inside track consequently you could not close the curtains and shut out the light from the streetlights outside. I was tempted to rehang them properly for a moment but then thought why should I? The bathroom defied description I really couldn't do it justice suffice to say the graffiti burned onto the outside of the door really set the scene for within. I would have complained but had already been told the hotel was fully booked by the company that had booked the room for me and as I was being picked up within an hour of booking in just could not be bothered to try and get it sorted. The only plus point was breakfast reasonable quality fry up and you could have as much as you wanted personally I would rather have a decent room and a croissant. After breakfast I went back up to my room to get my stuff and check out and while I was in the lift got talking to another inmate who told me that he and his wife had to make do with one towel between them and reception was not interested when they told them ! it seems this place is geared to solo business travelers who are going out and just want somewhere to sleep. If you have booked here do yourself a favour and cancel now there are other hotels nearby that are much better and no dearer this place is best not experienced.,abjem
UR64269099,2010-16-May,Got a good deal but sometimes prices can be more and your better off spending twice as much in the premire inn which right opposite wembley stadium. My car was broken into and totally trashed it. Staff couldnt care less! the lifts didnt work and main recptiopn toilets whetre horrid. Rooms where standard and toilets where clean the rooms were very noisy as they faced the busy north circular road. overall very unsafe standard hotel. spend double the price for peace of mind and good night sleep.,Samiya1987
UR89850841,2010-14-December,My usual choice of hotel while visiting Wembley was full so we tried this one. Not a nice area staff were very friendly and helpful but the hotel itself is the problem. There are reports on here of thefts from cars they have responded to this by erecting a 6 foot perimeter cage around the building accessible through a small gate for pedestrians car park access via barrier at left hand side although both wide open we came via tube to Stonebridge Park about 10 minutes walk away under lots of bridges. About 40 mins walk from Wembley Stadium/Arena and just 5 mins away from the Ace Cafe famous as a biker meeting place. Looked a nice place to eat too! The hotel room (613) was clean but had fallen into disrepair there was a hole in the bathroom door that had been repaired rather than replaced looked like someone had put a fist through it. The power socket seemed to alter it's power therefore hair dryer did not work properly. There was a vent on the wall with a hole in it stuffed with newspaper. The heater worked when it felt like it and there was a draft from the window and that let in the traffic noise from the front main road if you are a light sleeper take advice from others here and ask for a room at the back although the walls are paper thin and we could hear the TV in the next room. There was hot and cold running water but when using a shower just hot would have been appreciated for the duration of the shower rather than periodic bursts of cold water thank you. No plug in the sink and the tray for tea/coffee had been previously used as an ashtray obviously not cleaned before refilling with sachets. There were lipstick kisses on the mirror very sweet but apart from looking like a horse had put them there it's not a welcome I'd found in any other hotel. If you are going to Wembley stay at a Premier Inn and book early or even another Travelodge ... just not this one,bellysbride
UR79312682,2010-13-September,This hotel doesnt really have much going for it. We stayed here for one night to save driving home after a concert at Wembley stadium. I wish id driven home! The hotel itself is in dire need of a makeover the reception area is tired very basic and just generally not very pleasant (stained carpets tacky floors etc). The stairway offers little encouragement en route to your room dirty carpets giving way to plain metal steps and the sense of using the stairs in a multi storey car park. The rooms themselves are clean and tidy but its in the rooms that the main problem with this hotel is to be found. NOISE and plenty of it the traffic outside is relentless (we saw less traffic on the M1 on our journey home) and it feels (and sounds) like your sat right on top of it. The glazing is simply insufficient to shield even the worst of the noise. Ive stayed in noisy hotels before with slamming doors and noisy lift mechanisms etc but this place takes the biscuit. Even with ear plugs in (purchased hastily in London having realised how bad it is after our arrival) the noise was ridiculous. The traffic never stops and the noise is unremitting. Unless youre the sort of person who can sleep through a herd of trumpeting elephants then steer clear. If your lucky enough to get a room on the other side of the hotel you may find the noise isnt a problem im guessing that it may be a bit better there but cant say for sure as despite asking to be moved there were no rooms available on that side for us to move to. In terms of location this hotel is approx 2 miles from Wembley stadium not too difficult to get back to after a concert at the hallowed ground you may think Well 3 hours after the concert finished we eventually made it back. You could probably walk it in less than that but id advise against it as the area doesnt seem the safest and a lot of the route is along dual carriageway without pavement. We left Wembley stadium pretty swiftly and were funnelled down the main concourse towards Wembley Park tube station along with 90000 other people. Mounted police hold the crowd back as the station obviously couldnt cope with everyone flooding in all at once. It ended up taking a good half hour to get to the station (usually about 10 mins walk). If your going to an event at Wembley you may be interested to know that there were literally no taxis around (not even occupied ones). We tried ringing one and the firm advised that there just werent any in the area as it was so busy. We also tried getting to a bus but found the queues just as bad. So the only option left was the tube usually im happy to travel on the underground but the real pinch here is that to get the 2 miles back to the Travelodge on the tube you have to go all the way into central London change lines twice (first at Baker Street then at Bond Street) to come all the way back out again. Its then a ten min walk from Hangar Lane station back to the Travelodge and the comfort of your noisy hotel room. Also I could be wrong but I strongly suspect that the train out of Wembley Park has no engine and is in fact pulled by a horse. Of course Travelodge arent responsible for such transport difficulties or the volume of people trying to get out of Wembley after an event but its something to consider if your thinking of staying here after a concert of event of some kind. You may want to think twice before booking in here as its very difficult to get back to and its not the best of hotels in the first place. Given the transport chaos after a Wembley event its easier to get into central London than it is to get back to the Travelodge. You may even want to think about driving (there were queues to get out of the car park but I doubt anyone queued for 3 hours!). In the interests of fairness Ill say that the staff at the Travelodge were all friendly and helpful the rooms were clean and we parked easily (we arrived approx 12.30). Travelodge do also refer to the road noise on their website but all in all this is a poor hotel in a poor location. Best avoided.,JasonCook
UR70751133,2010-13-July,It was filthy. I told the kids to never sit on the floor. When I asked for linens for the children's beds so we could sleep after our arrival I was told - exact quote - "Lady you are not the only person staying in this hotel." The mattresses were bare and they were stained and thin and looked like something out of a movie about crack addicts. I was after some insistence finally handed some sheets then (of course) I had to make up the bed myself. The baseboards of the rooms were full of holes that were patched with what looked like black electrical tape. The main double bed was lumpy and thin and you could feel and hear the metal springs. The shower actually worked well - that was a huge surprise. The water kettle did not work - probably hadn't in years. The only bright spot was that one (ONE) of the women who worked at the front desk was quite courteous and friendly. We booked this hotel at the last minute and other places in London of even a reasonable price were full so we weren't expecting luxury. In fact at this price I was bracing for something pretty bad. I didn't however expect this level of filth and rudeness and the constant reek of marijuana whenever staff members were in the hall. Or the middle of the night false fire alarm that ruined our sleep and I suspect may have been related to the drug use. I really did not think that a place could be this unsanitary and uncomfortable and even survive as a business.,professormomma
UR53411704,2010-13-January,I've staying in loads of Travelodges and have always found them clean modern with all the basics I need. Some are better than higher brand hotels. This one is like an old converted office block. Stains on the carpets graffiti in the lift. Railing around like a prison. VERY VERY loud traffic noise 24 hours beacuse all the seels on windows are worn. I asked for an additional pillow at 5pm (there were 2 in the room) - was told "Too late - I work on reception - do i look like someone who cleans rooms" I would never stay here again.,taith99
UR79218522,2010-12-September,Our second time of staying here for a Wembley event. First time average this time awful. Please see photo's of bathroom. The corridor down to our room (ground floor corridor to the left) had a powerful stink of tom cats and damp bad enough to make me heave and I am a nurse! When we got in bed we rolled together! The breakfast was chaotic very disorganised the tables weren't cleaned between guests. They only had bacon sausage and scrambled egg and these constantly ran out and the wait for more was shocking. There were 2 pots of yoghurt in the fridge and as far as fresh fruits goes there were some sliced grapefruit. Nothing else. So much for all you can eat variety. Location wise the hotel is 2 miles away from wembley stadium and an easy straight forward walk. The noise outside the hotel is like a motorway however we can honestly say once in the room we heard nothing. Our room was at the back though may be different if at front. There is plenty of parking spaces. It cost us 5 for 24 hours. No free wi-fi although wi-fi available at a cost. Overall you do get what you pay for as London is very expensive but I wouldn't recommend this hotel or stay there again myself.,tigggeeer
UR74893511,2010-12-August,All i have to say is that this place was awful. The room smelt of damp the sofa bed (my boy was meant to be sleeping on) was ripped and heavily stained. Floor and walls were filthy skirting boards falling away from the walls. The whole building and location looks very tired and worn. The area is not very pleasant walking back from tube station which is a good 10 mins walk at night !,seven8six
UR82975617,2010-11-October,The Wembley Travel Lodge London UK I am not quite sure where to start. This Hotel should not even be open for business; It was more like staying in a prison it was a monstrosity. I have stayed in many hotels over the years but this is by far the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. The reception staff where rude and un helpful they took 15 minutes to serve us after waiting and seeing no staff. The place smelt like smoke that was drifting in from people smoking right in the door way. It was un-clean and very tatty. There where holes in the chairs the roof and the doors. Water was split all over the floor causing a hazard I saw no one clean it up. I know the hotel was cheap but this was not up to any standards that the Travel lodge boast. I usually stay with Premier Inn and I wish I had this time I am so disappointed as it ruined out trip to London. When we left there was police in the reception that had been called out because one lady had had here room robbed! We never felt safe. The shower didnt work in the room the sink was un-clean and when we asked to move to a room with a shower the ignorant staff went on to tell us the hotel was full. We were provided with tea cups in the room for tea they where chipped and dusty the lifts where really slow so if we ever needed anything we had to walk up 4 flights of stairs each time as there were no phones in the room. It was worse than a hostel! There was rubbish in the hall ways that had been there all day LONG. Im sorry but I am outraged by the staff and how we were treated. There was absolutely no reason for this to happen. The place just basically needs shutting down if Im honest. There was no iron to iron my suit. The hotel is a sham.,SAMMY123056
UR81743289,2010-1-October,Check in  took forever. Room was a twin  had requested a double at reception on checking in (yes there was double available as receptionist offered!!) Usual 2 untra flat pillows per couple - more provided on request from reception. Room cleanliness was terrible  carpet / skirting boards / bathroom corners / shower tiles / toilet. Room  no side light on one side of the bed (not just bulb gone  NO light fitting on the wall). No light over the shower  only one light in the bathroom which was poor. One of the curtains was hanging off the rail. Window opening had sharp metal parts  cut my finger (had to open the window to waft the smell out!). Tea & coffee making facilities  Yes  But odd cups / wooden sticks rather than spoons / no tray / just enough drinks for 2 each (3 with milk)! TV remote control was filthy/grubby had no back on it. Then would not work to turn the TV off once in bed! Unable to comment on breakfast as I wasn't willing to chance it having slept in the hotel Check out  took forever - & we hadnt bought anything; the room had been paid for on booking  we had just slept (tried). Then the receptionist told me if we wished an invoice/receipt we had to print it off ourselves at home/office Good location for the A406; Ace Cafe & possibly Wembley ..... that's it!,Messagetoothers
UR85631104,2010-1-November,Stayed for 2 nights end October 2010 won't be rushing back. Arrived 2.30PM and was ignored for 5 minutes at which point we were hissed at that check was three PM sir! we pointed out we had paid for early check in and the attidude changed....... Not a great start!! Went up to the room on the second floor. Shabby decor and a poorly fitted carpet in the corridor that would challenge ladies in geels or the elderly. Double bed made up but the sofa bed had a trundle. Before we could make up our own bed we had to remove the bed side cabinet and then pull out. Once out you either forsake the space next to the double or move in to the free space by the dresser. Either way you lost the space to move; ok for one night useless for any longer. Breakfast 7.50 a head kids eat free only eggs were scrambled hard and dry.... didn't bother the second day with only six hot items. Room smelt of meat all day / night due to kosher factory behind the hotel which is better than being right on a very busy main road on the other side of the hotel I suppose. Web access in room 5 per hour or 12 day parking 5 per day but we parked on the road outside for free. Can't swear to it but the "ladies" stood outside the gate appeared to be "working". Beds were lumpy lifts worked occasionally during our stay and staff need to master english to be effective. On the positive side they brought us three evening meals when we had only ordered two. We gave up trying to explain to the chap serving us so I ate the unorderd meal which was rather good. Lanuage is a barrier to effectiveness they really need to work on,buychem
UR88766961,2010-1-December,Don't waste your money on this one where do I start!!! constant noise all night long from traffic light fittings falling off bedside lamps insufficient towels cups pillows as it was double occupancy kettle hazardous didnt even swich itself off bed well you could feel every single spring bathroom dirty and they had the cheek to charge extra 4 as booked room on the same day as stay,simplyperfect
UR50966858,2009-9-December,We booked over the internet to stay here after the Taylor Swift concert at Wembley arena under the promise of its close proximity to the arena and being only 0.5 miles to the nearest tube station-perfect we foolishly thought... We found our way to Hanger Lane tube station easily only to emerge from the station onto a multiple lane very busy junction/roundabout/pedestrian subway which did not tally with the easy-to-find only half a mile away travelodge we were expecting. We walked for about a mile on what we were led to believe was north circular road and eventually found a newsagents to ask for directions only to be told that this was totally wrong. We got on the recommended bus into Wembley and found (yes another!) newsagents where we asked for directions only to be told that there was no way that it was within easy walking distance a definite taxi job and that it couldn't be walked from Hanger Lane either as it was situated at the side of a busy A road (A406) and you had to cross multiple busy junctions to get there. At least one of the locals knew where it was situated. Obviously it is not 'easy to find' if no locals (including the bus drivers!) know its location. So...when we finally arrived at the travelodge (3 hrs later) we checked in and were given a room key that didn't even work and the dumb receptionist didn't believe us even though we saw that she had to try 6 or 7 more keys before she gave us our replacement one. The reception was very shabby with the carpet behind the counter visibly stained and stuck together with duct tape in several places! The room was ok very basic stained carpets but 2 single beds not the double bed as promised on the website. We didn't have time to complain about this so just gave in and accepted and went to our concert. I have to say that this is most definitely the worst travelodge I have ever stayed in and I certainly won't be returning there. If you want to be near the arena or stadium try the Quality hotel Premier Inn or Ibis-they truly are within walking distance!,yorkhoteluser
UR34058957,2009-6-July,Stayed as a base for myself  husband  daughter and mum for take that concert as travelled from Wirral ! "What a hell hole " what can i say but don't book this hotel ! ! ! ! - massive queues to check in - broken vending machines - lack of pillows - broken plug sockets exposed wires ! also the temperature in rooms was crazy so hot that you could have been in egypt ! (no air con ) except in reception ! everyone was complaining about this. also we were charged 5 to use hotel car park but not once told that cars were often broken into ! ! (only discovered this when looking on trip advisor to see other peoples reviews !) we were soon to discover this as a reality following morning when 3 cars had their windows smashed to bits ! ! luckily ours was ok but i guess when security gates are left open 24/7 these things are more likely to happen crazy So no would not recommend nor ever stay again if you're going to Wembley for an event try "the Ibis" chain right outside.,moog11
UR23893602,2009-25-January,Situated alongside the North Circular 'raceway' that means you won't get much sleep or - if you're unfortunate like me - none at all because you're next to the lift shaft that goes non-stop. The rooms are as others say unusually large for a Travelodge - but that's where the praise ends. The window didn't shut properly the extractor fan didn't work the flush on the toilet was like spitting at a rottweiler. The Cafe-Bar was neither a cafe nor a bar. It had just three main courses on offer of the eight on the standard menu with the five - shall we say - 'land based meat' options oddly all unavailable. The Bar had the first four choices of drink out of stock to the point they couldn't even charge me 2.90 for the advertised 440ml can (yes can) of Strongbow that would have cost 60p from a supermarket. Most people would book this hotel to go to Wembley Stadium/Arena as I did. I'll echo the advice of others to be wary of the night. Leaving the Travelodge on foot there is about a third of a mile of abandoned buildings that have waste graffiti and broken windows. At night roving groups of hoodies wander round with their faces hidden. You'll be OK in a group as I was otherwise spend the tenner on a taxi just for your own sanity. Having said that with the lack of options available at the hotel we ventured onwards very early to find food and drink. The Ace Cafe about 1/3mile further along the road towards the stadium is fantastic. Realistically priced good - simple - food. We also picked out a small family run Irish bar further on the route to the stadium. I forget the name but we spent six hours in there happily and at very reasonable prices. I expect one thing of a Travelodge being a budget hotel and that is of a decent night's sleep. I've been in Travelodges all over the country and had fine nights on the side of usually deafening motorways. This one failed badly on both nights. Even on the discounted price I had the room for it was poor value. Better soundproofing and better management would do this place no harm. But I'd guess - from the look of the surroundings - the whole place is scheduled for demolition and it's not worth them spending the money. I'd advise you not to spend yours either.,mw_hufc
UR44270789,2009-24-September,Booked one night here for myself and my daughter after the Coldplay concert at Wembley unfortunately I had booked before looking at the reviews here. The location although only a 5 minute drive to the stadium is horrendous being on the North Circular in the middle of an old industrial estate. Double glazing should mean a reasonable nights sleep in the front rooms until you spot the gaps around the window which means the noise changes to that of a jet taking off luckily my daughters room at the back meant she at least got a decent nights sleep. Reception staff were ok and the room was of a reasonable standard if a litle 'tired'. The disappointing breakfast confirmed why most travelodges don't do food - cold undercooked bacon no sausages cold scrambled egg cold beans cold tomatoes and cold mushrooms don't really satisfy my breakfast requirements. Two domestic 2-slot toasters meant a longish wait while you made your own toast (but at least it was hot!) washed down by a decent cup of coffee sorry I forgot the coffee machine wasn't working so you had to make yourself a cup of Nescafe. In conclusion the worst travelodge I have experienced,bimmoLiverpool
UR49949245,2009-24-November,Unless you do not value your car or your belongings go ahead and stay here 12 vehicles have been broken into this morning 12!!!! no one heard a thing and the best part the sercurity cameras DONT WORK!!! This is a joke and trying to get hold of a member of staff is impossible! We have never attended somewhere so unprofessional and down right ignorant! Warning to all fellow travelers do not stay in this hotel!!!!,kimij123
UR49876665,2009-23-November,This is in the middle of nowhere. Across the road is a food processing plant (that smells a little) and beside it are what seem to be disused warehouses. We arrived at 1.30pm. They told us to check in before 3pm we would have to pay an additional 10. We had to meet friends in central London at half two so had no choice but to pay up. We came back that evening and had a bit of food in the bar which was ok. However I could see a number of hoodies congregating in the carpark - then one of them went and broke into a car. He was trying for ages to get it started but only managed to get the windscreen wipers to go and the lights to flash. I told the receptionist who ran outside with one of his colleagues. He did not confront the thief rather came inside again. The guy was still trying to steal the car five minutes later. No police arrived. Where they even called? Thankfully I didn't have a car with me - otherwise I wouldn't have got to sleep. By the way this is nowhere near Wembley stadium or arena - you would be better off staying somewhere closer to town at double the price as it will take the same length of time getting there. The rooms were fine and the breakfast ok (although badly organised and my wife's cup was cracked and fork dirty). This could be a decent 3 star hotel but appears to be very badly run. I wouldn't dream of coming back here.,brucegrimshaw
UR32966034,2009-23-June,Ive stayed in travel lodge hotels... and i must say for what you pay... u really get a good deal... But this one... NO!!! I've never stayed anywhere like it... it was awful... the shower head was broken and we had to use a towel to try and tie it up around the bar to hold it up... we had 1 pillow each... well if you can call them pillows... they were about as thin as the sheet itself... the window didn't shut properly... which is a major problem when sleeping next to a busy motorway... have these people not herd of thicker glass to shut out the noise... and the worst part about the hotel for me... was the heat... the heat was unbearable you couldnt have the window open as the traffic was to loud... and even if you left it open while you went out... it still had no effect... so we made a complaint... they gave us a fan... for a while this was good... but it soon wore off due to the fact it started to circulate the rest of the heat in the room round... so we asked for another 1... alot of good that 1 was as it didnt even work... i stayed in this hotel as i was going to wembley stadium... and the fact it stated the underground was a short little walk up the road... Yeah Right... try about 15 mins or abit more... down a run down street that if you was alone you wud probably get mugged or worse... once you got to the station it was about a half hour journey to just about anywhere in central london... as for the buses they are neither use nor ornament... 4pound i paid to go to wembley central and the dropped me off a brent shopping center... even tho they said they was goin wembley... great now i was miles away from where i needed to be for a specific time... i wudnt recommend this hotel... not for ne one... not for ne thing... if they had aircon or summin it wud have maybe made the stay slightly better... but this hotel if very very poor......,kerry1990
UR48319800,2009-2-November,I have stayed at travelodges before and found them basic but satisfactory. This one however is of very poor standard. Firstly if you are visiting wembley arena or stadium and hoping to save on parking dont be fooled: This hotel is not really in Wembley proper and is a 1 hour walk through a rather frightening area or else two bus rides (92 and 112) and a short but just as frightening walk away. Secondly the hotel is generally tatty with desk staff who were abrupt and unhelpful. On arriving in our rooom we went to close the windows because of the roar of traffic noise from the north circular road outside only to realise that the windows were in fact already closed. For the cost of parking at wembley stadium you may as well spend a little more and spend the night at the Premiere Inn next to Wembley Park Tube station. Thats what we did and we were far more impressed. It's the first time I have ever checked out of a hotel I have paid for before spending more than even half an hour in my room.,foxy091
UR36471235,2009-2-August,We stayed at this hotel simply because it was the cheapest in this area. The hotel is situated next to a dual carriageway  so it is noisy throughout the day. There is not much ventillation in the room. Even if you open the window  the noise level is so high that it's difficult to sleep. The room was clean and ok. Some of the lights were not working and impossible to read at night. Staff were friendly and helpful.,sunriseprincess
UR34462851,2009-11-July,Stayed here with some work colleagues while visiting one of our offices but what a pit. Paid $160 for two nights and that did not include breakfast which was an extra 7.50 and not great food. Luke warm and the scrambled egg was yuk. Was billed three seperate amounts for the same round of drinks. Always ran out of ice about 10.30 every night and would not supply any more and had no lemon orlime for drinks. Basics for a bar but very difficult for this lot. The whole hotel was tired and very noisey. Carpets were filthy and my room stank as it had not been aired. Wndow only opened about 2 inches and as I was at the back of the hotel was was woken by trucks reversing at nearby depot. Front of hotel was worse. Noise from the road was terrible as it is a main trunk road. Don't take your car there either. Complaints of cars being broken into. Nearest tube is Hangers lane about a 15min walk or an 8 taxi ride. Taxi's round there are a rip off and have no meters. To get into central London will take about 30-40 mins on tube. Taking into account what I paid for room and breakfast I could of stayed at the Crowne Plaza closer to tube station for the same price. They say you get what you pay for. well I paid 3-4* price for a 1* pit. Don't go there unless you are desperate for a place that is near Wembley.,navigator
UR50451561,2009-1-December,I have to say the room was ok but in the morning our car and 9 others had been broken into and staff where not at all interested one laughed and said we had 14 broken into the other saturday!!!!!! the best thing is that they charge you 5 for the secure parking we would have been better parking in the street. Will never stay there ever again and will never recommend it.,andyrance
UR15870987,2008-9-May,Me and my boyfriend went to this travel lodge in March 2008. It was my first time in London and COULD NOT believe how big it was. It took us HOURS to get around and a while to find the hotel. We did arrive in London at 7am so we went to the sites the london eye etcccccc. We got the metro and then had a big walk. The check in time was not avalible until like 3 so we got there and The woman was rather rude at the front desk. We took the lift up to the room. The room was basic TV with basic channels double bed desk kettle and tea/coffee making bits and bobs. The bathroom was fine until i got into the shower. I started having a shower and the water was not going away! it got rather worrying you didn't exactly want the water to go all over the floor. The water was hot and nice but you had to hurry up so it wouldn't overflow! It gradually went down thankfully. Could not be bothered trying to complain felt we would just grit our teeth and bare it. Bed was uncomfy once again. ONE PILLOW EACH. THAT STRESSES ME OUT. We went down to the eating area and I ordered spag bol and my boyfriend ordered a cheese burger. my spag bol was microwaved... and his burger was greasy but he eat it anyway. I however did not bother with the rest of my spag bol. it was horrible. The pasta had a slimey glaze on it and the meat was vile. We did not bother in that place again. The drinks were also expensive. a coke was like 2 ! The vending machines are also rather expensive too! But they do have toothbrushes in them in case you forgot. If you are going to Wembley Stadium/Arena it is more than likley someone else in the hotel is. We were going to see The Cure and there was a lot of people in the hotel going to see them too. So we headed down to the reception to book a taxi to get there. A couple overheard us asking for a taxi and said that we should just share to cut the coasts! Fantastic idea. The cab cost about 10 and there was 4 couples in the taxi so we hardly paid anything to get there. GET out the venue fast to get a taxi. The driver gave us a card to call afer the gig but we just saw one and jumped in. it cost 12. Oh well worth it. Overall for 2 nights not so bad. Its on a very busy road so ask for a back room we got a back room. Not a very good view you can only just see wembley! The road up there was rather dirty and has a strange load of sofa shops and a chinese supermarket. Get a map a tour book and please remember its hard to find. Just get taxi it will cost you.,floooooooooooorence
UR19594589,2008-1-September,Well what can I say! If you are looking for a hotel that you can get to sleep in THIS IS NOT the one. Stayed here with 2 adults and an 8yr old booked as close to tube station ideal for getting into central London. When we checked in reception staff were ok on getting out of the lift all the signs of what was to come were there the smell that met us was not very pleasant on opening the room door the noise struck you straight away hotel is on one of the busiest roads in London. Asked to move was told this would not be possible as hotel full the workman standing beside me at reception very kindly gave us 2 pairs of ear plugs saying he always carries them when staying here just in case. Rooms were obviously available as people were still checking in 3hrs after our arrival. After a very noisy night with no sleep had by all went back to reception and asked to move or we were leaving amazingly a room at the back of hotel became free. While we were out our stuff was moved this was appreciated. This room was a little quieter until 6am when noise starts on estate at back of hotel. The rooms were very basic which we expected but were in dire need of a lick of paint in both rooms bedside lights did not work in one there was a large hole in the middle of bathroom which looked like it had been punched. Did not eat in the hotel had a look and tables were dirty so decided to eat out. This hotel could do with a good clean and some double glazing. YES its a budget hotel but we would not stay here again if it was free!,AccringtonEllis
UR16552224,2008-1-June,This place may well be cheap but it is far from cheerful. Set in an industrial area it is uninviting and with a little rain at midnight it wouldn't look out of place in Blade Runner. The staff were surly the reception miserable and dirty the whole place had a funny smell to it (more later) and it was far too warm and sticky. The room was large the bedding clean the carpet walls and furniture dirty the sofa bed a junk shop throw out. There was no air con the room was too hot the windows opened onto a seedy industrial area with a number of factories producing foul smelling food (hence the funny smell). The tube station is an unpleasant half hour walk along dirty streets and through smelly subways. Do yourself a favour spend a little more and stay elsewhere.,squirtit_green
UR8823956,2007-19-September,We stayed two nights at the hotel this past weekend and found the hotel staff very friendly and approachable however the room and the overall standard of the hotel were appalling. Our room was located in the 4th floor and there was a pungent smell of fried garlic and onions which we put down to guests eating take away in their rooms but it was so strong that it seemed someone had been cooking in one of the rooms. Our room was dusty and there was a patched hole in the wall. That night we slept badly but we put it down to tiredness and waking up early. On the second night we decided to go to bed around 22:30 to get some sleep but just after midnight we were woken up by children running up and down the corridor. After about 1/2 hour my partner decided to complain but the adult playing chase with the children reply was: "it is her birthday". They did quiet down after 1 hour. By then we have noticed the reason we did not sleep well the night before were bed bugs!!. The receptionist was very sympathetic and offered a complimentary breakfast but by then I just wanted to leave the hotel to never come back again!!!!,SilviaY
