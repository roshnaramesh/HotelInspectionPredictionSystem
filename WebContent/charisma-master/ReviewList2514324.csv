UR124349977,2012-9-February,I booked a room for a friend and was shocked. Past the reception the hotel inside is a labyrinth smelly old. The room was a disaster. One wiindow could not be shut half of the carpet was missing the toilet had partioned walls with no plaster or wall paper on it. Just board! THe staff was mostly unhelpful and was charged  59!! Stay away from this dump.,ItaloScot69
UR122772907,2012-8-January,The hotel is being updated but it didn't trouble us. The name is being changed to All Seasons ....in 2012. The beds were very good. I think our room was "new". The rooms are very basic . Our room 921 was a 5 minute labyrinth walk from the reception. We had a kingsize bed and a single bed. The room is small with a chair a chest with three drawers and a small open closet with 1 shelf. There is a very small desk with a watercooker and two cups and teabags. The television is small. There are no bedlights just two lamps on the ceiling. The bathroom is very small with a (good) shower sink and toilet.All most no room to place things. The bathroom is dirty in the corners.There is allmost immediately very hot water. We had 3 not to large white towels for two persons. There was a stain on one. We had no hairdryer. Breakfast is very basic with white bread jam. Cereals with milk. Tea coffee hot choco or choco milk. The bread can be toasted. Sometimes there was brown bread. The parking is free you have to ask for a notice to park there yourself. The Wi-fi in the lobby worked and is free. It is not to far away from London.(15 min. walk to the station (=2 min. by bus 249) and 30 min by tube to London Victoria). Take a travelcard at the station for 4 zones for 7 pound 70 pro person and you can travel to London and back and the whole day by bus and tube.For 7 days you can have a different card for 34 pound. When we asked for a room near our children that was not possible. An extra keycard for our three children was also not possible. It seems they have read your reviews as there was now brown bread better beds notes on the walls to tell the direction in some parts of the hotel. When the hotel would be cleaner and there would be bedlamps installed and at breakfast cheese ham eggs and more brown bread and some fruit giventhe hotel would be better.,avmn
UR125586771,2012-4-March,Reception kept changing room rates from 30 per night up to 50. i left spare change in my case and alot went missing!! Alot of building contractors here and the smell of canabis over powering!! over all DONT BRING THE GIRL FRIEND!!,craig f
UR122516524,2012-4-January,Being fair and honest in this review. It was 30! So i wasnt expecting much i have stayed in hostels for the same money. However you expect the basics of what every website advertises for the hotel eg. towels tv tea and coffee. We went in dropped off or luggage and headed into London as check in isnt until 2.00pm. I would strongly reccommend that you check the room before you accept it. We returned quite late after a day in the City and were exhuatsed we went into the room which didnt look too bad at first although quite dated. We discovered: TV- didnt work - it had bee selotaped together! Tea&Coffee - We had one mug two saucers no spoon and more importantly NO kettle! Bed Linen - Stained! Towels - one hand towel for 2! Then we put all that to the side didnt want to cause any fuss went to sleep to wake up and find we had to share a hand towel! The drive was to leave we popped upstairs for breakfast toast and cornflakes - continental really?? Upon checking out i told the receptionist the issues that we had with the room they were not bothered by what i had to say and were generally dismissive just an apology would have been nice! I have seen some recent pictures of the refurb which look good i hope it carries on through the rest of the hotel as at the moment it is just a disgrace at least advertise it as it is!,Honesty8787
UR126868609,2012-28-March,Walked into a tiny room with a double bed for me and a friend we then said there's two of us sleeping separately and they moved two single beds apart whilst doing this they removed the sheets and the mattresses were stained. We told them this was not acceptable but they refused to do anything about it! To add to this there was no room to walk so if there was a fire we wouldnt have been able to get out and the tv had no signal! The bathroom was disgusting shower head and taps were dirty doesnt look like it has been cleaned for years! To add insult to injury all of the curtains were stained and dirty. All round a terrible hotel! Never stay here!,Amber E
UR126726000,2012-27-March,Stayed at this hotel for location close to family I would never ever stay there again rooms filthy health and safety doesn't exist staff are rude smoke alarms hanging from the ceilings showers dont work no plug in bath (not that I would have liked to have used them so dirty). Please please look for somewhere else to stay.,luscombesd
UR125189593,2012-25-February,The pictures that this hotel displays is NOTHING less than a pure FALSEHOOD! The hotel is over 45mins from the center of city. It is Absoultly FILTHY! We checked in at apprx 3pm and checked out by 3:10...The place smells like grease garlic and sweaty bodies. The windows were bolted shut the plaster on the ceiling was falling one of our rooms had electricity. This hotel shouldn't even be rated a 1. Getaroom and anyother booking service should be embarassed to even represent the hotel!,Sharon S
UR126580351,2012-24-March,My parents and I had two rooms booked for one night. A single and double room. When we arrived my parents window was broken and needed fixing we had to go out and they assured us that they would fix it. When returned at 9pm it was not done. The single glazing was noisy as was all the other guests you could hear. The coffee making facilites were bad the plugs were covered up and they had to put the kettle on the floor. They had no spoons to make the coffee properly. The pillows were uncomfy and generally they had a bad night. When we went to the bar a member of staff went behind the bar to get himself a drink so we went to the local pub. My single room......well the window was broken the heating was stuck on one setting the plug socket was hanging off the wall the tv ariel was held in by masking tape that had been reused and only just stayed in the channels were only two there was no telephone generally very uncomfortable and dirty. The continental breakfast was soggy toast and cereal. The service was generally awful. I have stayed in better hostels.,Deborah J
UR123424131,2012-21-January,I wouldnt go back to this hotel if you paid me. After arriving on a very early flight from Vancouver we were made to wait 8 hours for a room. When we eventually got our room we believed they had cleared out a storage cupboard and put us in there. The floor wasnt flat and tilted downwards. There was holes in the wall. The room was small and dirty. The furniture was falling apart. We complained and were shown a room with bunk beds! My boyfriend and I were really hoping for something a little more adult - not to mention the room looked like a prison cell. After more arguing we were taken through a rabbit warren of corridors down to the 'dungeon room'. It had no windows and we felt as though we were miles underground. The 4th room appeared ok at first glance and we agreed to take it. We changed out of our traveling clothes got ready to take a shower only to find mould all over the bathroom ceiling after pulling the shower curtain back. We also discovered the window wouldnt lock and had a big crack through it (not safe at all). We then trudged back to the reception in our pyjamas and argued with the manager for another hour. Eventually he showed us a superior room - it was like night and day. The room was big and spacious and clean!!! I said 'we'll take it'. He told us there would be an extra charge per night. I told him that I would not pay the extra and after more arguing he eventually agreed to let us have it. The rooms they show online are of the superior rooms and the cheap rooms they sell online are the ones I have detailed above. BEWARE and fight for a better room. We were taken to and shown a ridiculous amount of dumps before the manager gave in and showed us a superior room. What a joke this hotel is and the staff couldn't care less. Half of them don't even speak English.,Lisa R
UR126246468,2012-17-March,definitely the hostel is too far from the city center (15 min walk to overground and then about 20 min to London Bridge) so If you are just for 2 or 3 days better take something closer. Usually overcrowded and bit noisy during the night. The positive thing - lean rooms (but small) and friendly atmosphere.,Anna M
UR122905815,2012-11-January,We wish we had read the reviews on Trip Advisor before we booked. Terrible hotel- things were falling apart. Our room was very basic (but liveable) but the rest of the hotel was dilapadated. They advertised having a restaurant and room service facility- the restaurant was permanantly closed and room service was non exsistant. Their 'Continental' Breakfast was literally bread and water- an absolute joke. Only good point was a lovely restaurant down the road in the town.,rocky2410
UR119105477,2011-9-October,Got into this hotel as part of a fly and stay package from the travel arm of a timeshare exchange operation. After reading reviews we tried to back out but effort was repulsed. We were scheduled for three nights in late August. On arriving the crumbling exterior of the buldling was immediately obvious along with the poorly kept grounds. Upon checking in was escorted thru a maze of ill maintained corridors to a basement room. It was soon apparent that "air conditioning" meant---open window. And we were told we needed to call the desk to get a phone!!! Which was somewhat entertaining. The carpeting and bedding was threadbare with worn spots showing the woodwork throughout was chipped and peeling the metal frame on the bunk bed was rusting and the bathroom was in shambles. Location was another issue. While waiting for checkin time we did some sight seeing in central London. It was 26 pounds for a gypsy cab to get there. And took and hour and a half via rail to return.,jctwizzer
UR112467744,2011-9-June,Where to start. This has to be the most absurd hotel I have had the misfortune to stay at. The majority of the staff seem to have a less than basic grasp on the english language and so are barely comprehesible. Then there's the cells or "rooms" as they call them. It would seem that the inmates/guests can't be trusted with a bath plug but i do suppose it could be a choking hazard also the lights seem to work on a combination puzzle system of which i never figured out the bedside lamp and resorted to using the TV for a gentler light before bed (which i was supprised to find quite passable). I was soothed to sleep by the gentle banging coming from the nearest stairwell and the overture of the local emergency services. The morning chorus was much the same. After morning ablutions and discovering that the toilet seat was a balancing act I went in search of breakfast so it was from first floor to reception where I was greeted by hoards of children on some kind of outing but no sign of breakfast or staff on reception. So i followed a sign for a dining suite only to find a short dead end corridor so back to reception and down to the balmoral suite where i found more children having their breakfast but no adult guests so... back to reception. MINOR SUCCESS! STAFF! I asked where I might find my breakfast "5th floor" Came the reply. 5TH FLOOR!!! Nevertheless off I trapsed up the several flights of stairs to the dining room where you are left to guess that you need to tell the girl making piles of toast that you want a cooked breakfast and she will then mumble some questions at you and you can get a warm beverage in a classy paper cup. My advice? Don't pay for breakfast as it's a rip-off. Sainsbugs is 2 minutes into town so get something there. I vacated that place as fast as my long legs would carry me. Before booking yourself into this hotel steal a car and ram it into Crystal Palace Police station You'll save a fortune be treated better and be far more comfortable.,82-mike
UR119042526,2011-7-October,After getting my partner some tickets to go and see Wicked in the West End we decided it'd be easier to stay over the night before and then travel during the next day as it was a matine show. It was all a bit last minute and we pretty much just chose the first place that had parking. Oh God how I wish we would have looked a bit more. After driving 5 hours from our previous holiday destination we arrived outside and thought it didn't look too bad considering it was 40. After pulling into the car park and walking to reception we were greeted by one of the gentlemen who spoke quite broken english. We paid on arrival but we booked through laterooms.com and therefore had to use a card to confirm our stay. The person who booked us in tried to explain something about an authorised payment on my other half card but after three attempts of trying to explain whatever it was he was trying to say we just said "Ah ok!" still having no clue. We weren't told what floor we were on but a moody couple who were in our lift told us it was the first floor. we wandered along the first floor corridor and holding our breath walked into what can only be described as a cheap hotel room they'd have in a terrible porno. There was semen on the curtains a huge hole in the wall a dirty repulsive bathroom a burnt iron print on the carpet no plug for the sink a rubbishly tiled shower and a toilet full of un-flushed toilet roll. Worst of all though where the rooms obviously once connected the door frame was filled by a piece of MDF not quite big enough for the hole so there was quite a sizeable gap at the bottom. We sat there for a little while on the only sort of clean thing in the room the bedspread and stared around mortified. Determined not to let it ruin our trip we set out to find somewhere to have dinner. Having seen a sign for the hotel restaurant we diced to take a ride in the lift up to the 5th floor. Upon getting there we were confused. there was a big white table in front of us and looking into the only other room available there were a few tables scattered around with a few older people sat there with a big plate of biscuits. There was nowhere to order food that we could see and there were tables that looked like buffet tables around the edges with tea and coffee dispensers and more biscuits. Bizarre to say the least. So we ran off to the nearest Wetherspoons instead. The night sleeping there was disturbed by the guest next door stumbling in drunk the early morning staff moving stuff around outside and the housekeeping waking us up at half 8. All in all we didn't really sleep in the stuffy smelly loud hotel. The hotels ONLY redeeming feature? A REALLY happy fish in the reception fish tank. This place was disgusting and dirty. The worst place I've ever stayed in. There are people on here going on about how its ONLY 30-40 for the room what are we to expect? We stayed in a lovely place just a night before which costed less and it was like the bloody Hilton compared. I couldn't even have a nice shower here as too long in the shower and it overflowed not that I'd want to spend a moment longer than I had to in the cesspool. NEVER again.,James R

UR116383896,2011-7-August,I don't normally write reviews even if I have a bad experience but I feel I have to warn people about how awful this place is. In desperate need of a refurb. Staff not friendly at all. Room was not clean stains on the walls radiator hanging off plug socket not fixed to wall properly damaged tiles shower looked dirty so didn't use room was like a sauna couldn't sleep at all. Also the breakfast included was either a slice of cold toast or cereal and tea from a machine which tasted like dish washer water. Do not stay no matter how desperate you are.,Mitchyboy01
UR115075592,2011-6-July,we went on a school trip to London and stayed with 30 persons in this hotel for 2 nights. Because the first room we got didn't exist we got upgrated to a suite. even this one was dirty!! but compared to my classmate's rooms ours seemed to be ok... there were bloodstains on the matrass on the sheets and even on the walls and the bathroom was so dirty! there were holes in the walls and in the windows in the hallway and there was even a window missing in one of the rooms it fell out!! it was really terrible! when we got back on the second day our rooms were overbooked. they tooked out all of our bagage and gave the room to other people. Reason: they thought we wouldn't came back because it was already 11 pm...,DjBizMonkey
UR121435441,2011-5-December,I have never stayed in a hole like this in my life! I will not bore you with the details but everything about this place is bad It is like the seventh level of hell in Dante's Inferno. Do not be tempted by the low price get a tent instead. It is a filthy stinking malevolent hole of a place and anyone contemplating staying here would be ten times better served by staying in a tent on the back of a camel! No! Don't do it! Horrible place horrible staff horrible rooms full of bunk beds. The food is not bad when it's not sneezed on (I kid you not) No! No! No! By the way if you book through Supabreak they will sympathise with you until it comes to getting your money back for such crap service they have hundreds of complaints about this place but still continue to list it.,Paddy0191
UR117648791,2011-4-September,Hotel should be condemended  along with the staff WORST hotel in this country. Don't know why it's not been shut down. It's an embarresment to Britian; God knows what all these tourists coming to London think when they end up staying there!!!!!!!!!!,MattR0berts
UR110721923,2011-31-May,Worst hotel that I have ever stayed in. My wife and I choose to stay in this hotel as a last resort. We needed a last minute hotel due to last minute change of plans. First we had checked in at 2am after a very long day of traveling. We were given a room in the basement that didn't look like it had been cleaned in awhile. There were (what looked to be) pubic hairs on the side bed table open packets of used shampoo in the shower holes in the walls and not vacuumed. Oh yes there were large boogers smeared on one wall. My wife and I were very tired so decided to deal with it for the night and change rooms in the morning. When morning came around we noticed there was no light coming from the window. Once opening the doors to the "window" we realized it wasn't really a window but a white wall. This is when we realized that we were actually in the basement. On our way out we told the staff about the dirty room and I overheard the front desk radio the cleaning service informing them to clean our room. Hours later we arrived to our hotel and realized that the room was in the same condition. I returned to the front desk and spoke with the "night manager." He said the cleaning staff had already left for the night. So I asked for another room which he replied they were all booked and could not give us another room. My wife and I tried to go to sleep for our last night in the Hell Hole when we were awaken by a stampede of wilder-beast (aka: 200 teenagers from Germany). The walls are very thin and our room was located under stairs. We returned to the front desk and talked to the "night manager" who informed us of the number for German teenagers who recently arrived and were causing a lot of grief for other hotel guests. At midnight I had enough of the hotel service staff who were not doing their jobs. I ended up loosing my temper among a group of teenagers running around the halls which finally awoke the German student's chaperone. In the morning we wanted to speak with a manager but she would not be in until later. We were given an email address to forward our complaint. We couldn't have left this place earlier or happier. In conclusion I always check TripAdvisor before booking a hotel and read other's reviews. The one time I didn't my family and I ended up in a roach motel. Stay elsewhere. The staff is rude they speak English until you have a complaint and the rooms are dirty.,btwkesw
UR119897283,2011-30-October,Booked a double room and they gave us a small double room with a four foot bed. The room was at the end of the building and took ages to get there. There was no hot water when reported to reception they suggested to take a shower with the hot water from the kettle as the maintenance staff was not available. No help offered to take our luggage to the room. I left the car in the Hotel car park for 2 days and I found it scratched thanks god is not my car but hired from Europcar and fully covered. When we complained to our friends about this place they have offered us to stay at their place but we could not do so as we had to pay this awfull room in full as we checked in. They would not keep our room otherway or refund any nights after payment. I wouldn't stay here again and do not reccomend to anybody.,PORTOSCUSO
UR121236173,2011-30-November,We stayed her on Monday 14th Nov 2011. What a [...] hole. Damp is an understatement. The staff didn't want to or couldn't speak english. We didn't dare stay for breakfast and checked out and into another hotel for Tue night. The bed was a 4ft 6 mattress on a 3ft 6 frame and my partner rolled out of it in the night. We were down in the basement with no clear tv signal. The bar was poor and the beer was off. Please pay that little more and give this dump a wide berth...I can only warn you but read the other reviews...they mainly say the same as me. The only plus side is the location but there are other hotels in this area.,SooPoo67
UR94972488,2011-30-January,1 out of 5 is too much for this "Hotel". We booked this hotel as a stay over after doing some backpacking in eastern Europe before continuing our journey home.. When we arrived we were greeted promptly and given our room (740) quickly. After that everything went from bad to worse. The room was adjacent to the service yard with shouting and fork lift engine very loud (2300 hours). The TV did not work and the shower was filthy. Almost the entire shower curtain was covered in mould. The plug sockets were cracked. ( while in Europe I stayed in cleaner 5 hostels). We called reception and told them of the problems and requested a room change. We were told nothing could be done until next day and that refunds are not given. After still getting kept awake as the window didn't close either. We called reception and asked again telling of the health and safety implications of room and our dissatisfaction with noise and was told that someone would come down. What I believe to be the security guard came down to look at room said he would tell staff to stop working so we could get some sleep. When pointing out the mould was met with the answer "it's just a bit of mould. That sometimes happens. Won't do no harm". After still not being dissatisfied with this dirty noisy room we started taking pictures on digital camera so staff could see. Five minutes later we received a call from reception asking us go come up and look at another room "the big room". This room was in centre of hotel and was quiet so we took it. Bathroom was slightly cleaner but had stains on Walls and curtains. I have photos of this place which I can send you. I would not stay at this hotel ever again. Staff rude and unwilling to help. Place is filthy and unhygienic. I have stayed in better hostels throughout EuropeBosnia and Serbia than this hotel. This hotel really needs investigating and shut down. I booked through a third party agent and was able to eventually get a refund from the head office (Euro Hotels Group I'll give their other hotels a miss if this one is anything to go by),Paulmedin
UR121359332,2011-3-December,Stayed with our daughter for one night and chose this hotel for its closeness to crystal palace would rather have travelled to the end of the earth. Dont take any notice of the pictures as the room we had was dark dingy and in need of updating. There was a bunk bed that looked like it had been picked out of a skip. The continental breakfast consisted of raw toast and cornflakes. We are not fussy people and this is the first time that we have written a review but felt we have to warn people to go elsewhere.,lisa b
UR116213131,2011-3-August,We booked this hotel without reading the reviews - BIG mistake.. The hotel is outdated and needs an emergency makeover internally and a social skills course for the staff. On arriving at the hotel we were given a room which to find seemed like an episode of the cryptum factor! The room was in the basement with a shower that a homeless person would think twice about using and general decor that was depressing. We had to tune the TV in and there was a fire exit door outside our room that wasn't locked and could be opened from the inside and outside. When we challenged the reception staff they told me that i was lying and there was no way that the door could be opened from the outside trust me a trained monkey could open that door and on that point would make a better fist of the role on reception than the sarcastic and surly middle aged Asian gentleman i spoke to who in my opinion is a disgrace and should be fired. I was not alone in complaining in fact in the 10 minutes i waited at reception there were 4 other guest that came up and complained about a wide range of issues and some refused to stay and left. In hindsight we should of done the same. The beds were dirty and i think staying at a youth hostel would of been a better choice! There was loud music played until 2am so not much sleep was had. What i would say is that even though i have stayed in 5 star hotels before i did not expect this to be a 5 star in fact i had prepared myself for a 3 star hotel. In my opinion this hotel if inspected would struggle to achieve above one star. I'm not the type of person to review anything i buy but i feel so strongly about this hotel i had to write my feelings down hopefully to persuade people like me who though 'well it's cheap i can put up with anything for one night!' not to stay here. The guests are mainly tourists and that is the worst thing this hotel is unfortunately an ambassador for the UK and i'm ashamed that people visiting the UK stay here what impression is that giving to them of us in the UK. To the management of the hotel and the general manager who i was told to see the next morning and the only person who could deal with the complaints. All i can say to you is you must be very busy dealing with complaints and either you your line manager or the owners of this establishment need to wake up and see that the 'hotel' you 'run' is a disgrace and i would be shocked if this is not closed down when inspected next. Hope this helps.,shaunsmitht
UR110381860,2011-29-May,Introduction: This hotel is that god awful I sat on my bub bed infested bed and wrote a song about how awful it was. On a much more personal note the in dependant owner / owners of Euro hotels should be ashamed for even attempting to sell these awful rooms to hard working people. STAY AWAY!!!!! RUN AWAY!!!!!!

This is dedicated to all the customers who walked out after paying for awful treatment bad service and bite marks from the bed bugs..... Theres spunk stains on the bed sheets. Theres no hinges on the door. The staff used to be friendly but it don't happen anymore. Theres jam rags in the bin the lecki sockets off the wall. Welcome home to the queens hotel...

So you'd better be aware Much more of this we'll crack up you will never understand Till you stay at the queens hotel. With prostitutes on meet and greet The bar staff half pissed Trip adviser did warn us but we rally couldn't resist.

UR118662204,2011-27-September,Booked through OTEL.COM. Having already stayed previously numerous times over the past few years and never encountered anything that wasn't resolved before didn't expect any problems. Unfortunately the room that we were allocated on this occasion was totally unacceptable. I complained about this room after the first night. Instead of a twin it was a room with two sets of bunk beds. One set seperated as twins. The built up set was so old that the frames were very rusty. There was on one electric socket in the room which meant you had to unplug the television to make a cup of tea. The television set was very old and only had a set top aerial which provided a very poor picture which became intolerable to watch. The room was dirty and this standard of cleanliness is disgusting when you have paid 59 this is not anything close to value for money. The shower head continually fell off when you tried to adjust it to enable the water to wash your body and had to be removed from the fitting as it was installed at such a low height you had almost kneel down to get under the head. The staff advised there were no other rooms they could move us to and my colleague and myself had to endure these conditions for the whole 3 nights stay. I complained to my office following the first nights stay explaining that reception advised us they had no other rooms to move us to and they contacted the Euro Group immediately who advised they needed to request on online refund form from the Group Manager this never arrived and following a reply to our first email requesting this on the 26.07.11 (the morning after the first nights stay) from the Group Manager advising he would look into it there was no further response. My office contacted him again on the 15.08.11 requesting the online refund form again but no form or reply was recieved until the 06.09.11. Unfortunately it was not the response hoped for. The hotel staff lied and said they had'nt received any complaint they then contradicted themselves by saying they had moved us to another room this was also not true as the night we moved to another room was for a seperate booking for an additional 4th (due to work commitments) night via Laterooms.com and not connected at all to the first booking. My office has been advised they will offer a 20% discount off the next stay. Assistance was also sought from OTEL.COM as they were the agent used to book through. This agent has also not been helpful. They are taking the information advising the matter has been resolved from the Group Manager despite my office advising it has not been in a satisfactory manner. Following their lies which then become clear following their own contradiction of the facts I will "NOT" be staying at this hotel ever again. DON'T STAY you can find 100% much better rooms for 59 per night infact I have stayed at better hotels with much cleaner and higher standards for much less than this.,Kevin D
UR110146893,2011-27-May,Due to Chelsea flower show all reasonable hotels were full on May 25th. Found Euro Hotel in Clapham for 69 pounds thru booking.com. When arrived to the place at 6 pm on the day of my stay they said "we don't have it" when I presented my confirmed reservation. The receptionist made arrangements called a cab and transferred me to Queens. They refunded the cab charged the balance (52 quid) for the room. The door to the room was not closed - it turned out it had to be slammed to close (later that night a neighbouring group of some Scandinavian youngsters had been testing the idea till 3 am and then again from 6 am). I lost more than an hour for transfer had to take a cab to O2 arriving 20 minutes late for the show which was the sole purpose of my flight to London. I'm giving the whole story as it seems that that "no booking/transfer to a better hotel" story has happened to other people too. The hotel itself is 10-15 minutes of brisk walk from Crystal Palace overground station. It's shabby interior and an unpleasant room made me want to get out there as soon as possible.. In essence I got what I paid for given the availability of hotel rooms in London at that time but the real value of my room was closer to 20 pounds. I will never consider staying there again nor in any other "Euro hotel".,Artur9X

UR114810243,2011-27-June,We booked a standard double room however when we arrived at the hotel we were advised our room was a 'twin' room and there were no doubles available (also tried to charge us having paid in advance). The room had 2 bunk beds and one single bed and was generally disgusting so we went back to reception and asked to be moved the only other room they had was similar 1 bunk bed and 2 single beds the room was down in the basement and it was horrible it was a dorm room basically worse than the average hostel dorm. I would have been upset had I have paid 20 but we actually paid 84 I'm actually embarrassed to admit. Easily the worst hotel I've stayed in please avoid.,mjtp88
UR119754029,2011-26-October,I booked this hotel as being half term and quite late notice there wasn't a lot of choice. have to say on 1st look it was not too bad we got there really early as wanted to make the most of a day in London the receptionist was quite helpful not a problem to park all day and a 15 min walk to the station after being given helpful directions by the receptionist. Got back quite late went to the room and realized why it is described as a 'budget' hotel. 2 single beds and bunk beds in our 'family' room( glad we not got a cat cos you couldn't swing it!) bathroom was functional- if by that you did not want a bath because there were no plugs in sink or bath! only 2 plug sockets had to make choices- watch tv and have a coffee  or charge my phone- you cant do both at the same time!lucky we were all tired from long day in London so slept fine but don't expect a 'continental' breakfast bit of toast and cornflakes I kid you not- that was all that was on offer. Ok for 44 I do not expect much but with travel lodges etc competing  I would only go here again if there was no other hotel within a 100 mile radiusactuallyI would rather just drive home!,judith h
UR105661898,2011-26-April,What can I say? It is really the most disgusting filthy nasty pig sty I have ever had the misfortune to visit. There were green glutinuous nose pickings stuck on the wall near the bed of my daughter pee stains on the matress and God only knows what else!!! When we complained we were treated like dirt by the rude ignorant poorly trained "staff"! I wouldn't send my worst enemy to stay in that place! Have you seen One Foot in the Grave when they think they are in a Portuguese prison? It's worse! AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!!,Mad_and_Marcus
UR119655418,2011-24-October,This hotel is just as bad as everyone says. However what makes me angry is the idiots complaining about its location. They are just PLAIN WRONG. 1. People complaining that it's not on the tube network - why not spend three seconds looking at a tube map before booking to find this out? 2. It is on the East London Line and mainline train routes. You can be in Victoria London Bridge or Canary Wharf in 25 minutes. You do NOT have to go to Brixton on a bus to get anywhere. That's just totally wrong. 3. People complaining about the cost of a cab into the centre... have you BEEN to a capital city before? What kind of idiot gets a cab 8 miles into the centre of a capital city and is then surprised when it is expensive? NOBODY gets cabs into town unless it's an emergency. So in conclusion the hotel is awful but Crystal Palace is great. Ignore the idiots.,john b
UR115727131,2011-24-July,I really cannot believe how awful this nasty place was. We are a family of 6. We have 4 children so had to book 2 rooms obviously we wanted to be close to each other. We could not have any further away from each other. 1 room was on the first floor and the other was on to other side of the building in the basement. There were onions stuck to the windows!!! Wires hanging from a plug socket behind the bed!!! A horrible stench in the room!!! No bedding only quit's which were ripped!!! Dirty black gunk came up from the plug hole in the sink!!! No plug!!! That was the ground floor room. The basement room had 4 'single' beds.. well a set of metal bunk beds and a metal bunk bed split in half for the single beds!!!! The most filthiest room I have ever seen!!! Refused to stay for even one night so was moved from that room to another almost the same on the first floor. As it was 11pm we had no choice but to put up and shut up until morning and then refused to stay longer as morning broke and demanded our money back for the 2 night and stayed elsewhere. In a word DISGUSTING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,186337Sharon
UR94227246,2011-24-January,I was down from manchester visiting my father in hospital and as this was the nearest hotel we could find so we booked it. When we got to our room it was disgusting. It wasnt clean and didnt look like any of the pictures on the website. Wish i had looked on trip advisor before hand! When we went to reception to complain there was another couple already complaining. They had been moved once and got moved to a room full of spiders. We was offered another room but i was too disgusted to even go back in the room. We checked out and found somewhere else to stay. They even had the nerve to deny us a refund even after only being in the room for about 10 minutes!! I would advise everyone to give this hotel a miss!!,ManchesterRose98
UR118435967,2011-22-September,My partner and I needed someone where to stay for the night near London. I walked in and asked if there was any room available after looking me up and down the receptionist looked on his computer and told me that the only room available was the suite "very good" room at 120. Supposedly the high rate was due to the fact that they were very busy Remember this is a 'hotel' that advertises double rooms from 49.99. Anyway it was late and we needed somewhere to stay so I said I will take the room after checking it. The receptionist then asked me to bring my partner into the room to so that we could check it together. I replied by saying that I can check the room myself my partner trusts my judgement. The receptionist then gets on his walky talky and calls for another member of staff who proceeds to tell me that he will not show me the room unless I 'show' him my partner. I asked him what this was all about. He then proceeded to tell me that when girls book rooms then invite men into the rooms there is trouble and then the police have to be called. Of course I was not only offended by this (being a 31-year-old professional women) but absolutely astonished that a hotel that is meant to be provided a service felt that it was acceptable to act this way. I went back to the car and told my partner the situation and advised him that I did not want to stay at this hotel because I did not like their attitude or what they were implying but because he was so tired he said we should go and atleast look at the room. We went back into the hotel and the member of staff took one look at my partner and said if that he does not want any trouble or the police to be called. There was absoulutely no reason for this. My partner asked him what he was implying and the member of staff told him the same story that he told me. I was ready to walk out but my partner insisted on staying because he had worked a double shift (if he wasn't so tired the situation probably would have escalated and the police probably would have been called). Needless to say that we checked -in but checked out at the crack of dawn. Unfortunately due to the terrible experience with customer service the quality of the rooms was not an issue. This is a basic budget hotel with rooms that should cost no more than 40.00 a night. It's a cheap hotel. It looks quite nice from the outside and the reception is quite pleasant there's an ok bar/lobby area but this really is a place where you stay if you are completely desperate. There supposedly best room in the hotel 'the suite' was old dull and smelly although it was large. There's ample parking. But first impressions last and I shall never forget this experience. They should not be allowed to stay open and I agree with someone else's review that this place should be shut down. No doubt we shall never be staying here again no matter how desparate we are - I'd rather sleep in the car (in fact I'd rather sleep rough) and I would not have stayed here unless if I was on my own.,Halfwaytr33
UR119574623,2011-22-October,Did not like this hotel at all. The first room we had was filthy so we changed rooms and the next wasn't much better. There was no variety for breakfast just cornflakes and toast.,Stormfanandy
UR109333813,2011-22-May,I needed to stay in South London and this hotel was the nearest available. I booked a single room with ensuite. On checking in I was informed my room was on the sixth floor. However once in the lift I found it only went up to floor 5. After trying in vain to find the sixth floor via the stairs I lugged my bags back down to reception to be told by the girl that it was her first day - there is no sixth floor. Another member of staff waved vaguely in the opposite direction and blatantly ignored my attempts to wander around finding my room. I eventually found it via the billiard room down a flight of stairs in the paint peeling disgusting basement. My single room turned out to be full of cramped bunkbeds - apparently it could sleep six. Honestly I have seen better homeless shelters. I feared to walk on the filthy bathroom floor for fear of what I might catch. I sculpted a bath plug out of a bar of soap as by then I felt adamant that they were not going to win! The bedding was clean but the room very basic. I didn't bother to try plugging the TV in to see if it worked. I found the phone under one of the bunkbeds completely inaccessible. Of course I had no reception on my phone either as the room was in the basement. I tried asking the reception for a taxi later that night but was told to go next door. I found the taxi office but had to totter down some steep steps in my high heels and felt they could have rung them for me as the cars were parked in the hotel complex. The next morning I found the restaurant only because I had seen floor five whilst trying to locate my room the day before. No-one had given any information about where and what time breakfast was. Although my booking promised 'english breakfast' my request was dismissed with contempt and I was handed two pieces of toast. I tried to get a hot chocolate from the machine but was told that it wasn't working. The coffee provided was so awful I couldn't drink it and had to wash my mouth out afterwards to get rid of the taste - I couldn't decide if it was the chemicals the cup had been washed in or just very cheap. I didn't like to think what might have been running round the room during the night. The next morning some half eaten pieces of toast were strewn around the billiard room along with piles of dirty rags/curtains. I didn't expect luxury for the price but did expect helpful staff and a certain level of cleanliness and for the food to at least be edible. This is truly one of the worst hotels I have ever experienced. I couldn't wait to check out the next morning.,carolsinger
UR121988041,2011-22-December,Absolutely awful. Stayed with my two kids. There was only a thin sheet between us and the blood stained bed. The sheet moved and my son ended up sleeping on the mattress that looked like it had been used since the 60s. There was a thin door between us and the next room. Needless to say at 12 midnight a young couple came in and started maiking noises like a porn movie. All could be heard. Not what I wanted for a 4 and 7 year old to hear. It's a total doss house. Do not go! The rooms smell and the carpets and electricity are a danger. I felt ill and cut my stay short. I think there may be some ok rooms but the two our party had were worse than prison.,Vicky T
UR109120479,2011-20-May,Stayed in this hotel as we were working in the area so not familiar with it at all. We were given a room in the basement with six very uncomfortable bunk beds in. No heating and very cold with no quilts inside the covers the TV didn;t work. \the floor was matted with hair no plug in the bath. I was full of a cold and decided i needed a bath so plug sized soap was used to bung up the outlet. the water escaped so quickly that I had to leave the taps running full pelt to have a decent warm bath. The breakfast was a choice of cornfakes or corntlakes jam in a little plastic container and toast. No hot chocolate as described in the hotel description. The security guard was noted to drink from the milk jug from the fridge in the bar rinsed(not washed) the jug and put it on the drainer. There were ladies of the night visiting with customers quite openly flashing the cash to get rooms that they waanted on demand!!!! I would definitelty never recommend anybody to visit this hotel even those with a strong stomach. I note that students and schoolchildren frequent this establishment I am sure that there must be better more appropriate places for innocent young people to stay and would not want my children sleeping in beds that have been used for inappropriate activities. Do not use this place unless you are desperate.,Shelleybobs
UR121928496,2011-20-December,This is by far the worst hotel I have ever stayed at.The rooms were dirtythe telly was an old 10inch crtthe sheets had stainsthe fire alarm had a plastic bag over it and only one plug socket worked.They knew we had a baby with us but there was no side light so trying to get him to sleep with an 80watt bulb was a nightmare.Continental breakfast was cornflakes and toast.....No parking so parked in side street. I would not recommend to my worst enemy.,Bimbee69
UR114967902,2011-2-July,You only need to read the other reviews to get the general idea. I was shown the way to my room which seemed miles away from anywhere. The room felt like a cell. It was not filfthy but to be honest I was so stressed by my surroundings I couldn't properly comment on this. I felt scared! I decided to leave and spent about 20 minutes trying to find a way out. At one point I came at the end of a corridor because I could see daylight. It was a junkyard with old furniture and stuff but absolutely no way out. Eventually I found my way out to reception. Directions to exits etc. were not clear (understatement). I presume they have had some health and safety approval but if so I am very sorry that the British system is so poor!! I would very much hate to be at this hotel if a fire broke out!! I made the mistake of many by not checking on trip advisor and just booking based on availability and price. Let's hope we can spread the word and make sure others do not suffer the same fate.,Scottish_Ladies
UR116192311,2011-2-August,The reception was ok but everything else was not. When I entered my room the lamp from the wall was hanging out of its socket the beds looked rickety and my tv didn't even work! My problem was that I read the reviews only after I booked this hotel. HUGE mistake! By the way the hotel is too far away from central London where everything practically is. The rooms let in too much exterior noise and it's not located in the best part of london. Stay here at your own risk!,Trip_Tech_11
UR115512912,2011-19-July,I booked a single room but ended up in a room with one bunk bed and a bunk bed which had been seperated into two singles. There was no wardrobe no bedside cabinet and the tv reception was very poor. The curtains were falling down and the over all appearence of the room was very tatty also I was kept awake both nights by the school children in two adjoining rooms shouting and banging on doors. On the plus side I found most of the staff to be friendly and helpful. I left two rings in my room when checking out and got these back for which I am very greatful. I also had a meal on the Saturday evening which which was good although I felt that the continental breakfast was very poor. In short I found that the service was good but the overall appearance and comfort of the room was disgusting,paulineBirmingham
UR116933757,2011-19-August,Having spent 9months a year for the past 9 years travelling for work. I have stayed in hundreds of hotels from private B&Bs to top 5star resot hotels. I have never felt compelled to comement on any before .But this one.... Well this has to be among the worst. Shabby decoration and fixtures. Awful smell general noise rude staff etc etc etc. I had issues with the car park (cars parked all over the place) they also appear to be running a taxi firm from the hotel. Trying to check in was a minefield the staff were very rude and unhelpful - he wasn't prepared to show me where I could park until I had checked in and paid for the room! Normally I park up get my bags etc then check in. The room was really shabby paint on the curtains burns and holes in the carpets awfull beds broken shower. I could go on for ever but I think you get the picture. I had breakfast booked but thought better of it so I can't comment on the quality of food. The one (and only) saving grace was although the room was worn out and pretty grim. It had been quite well cleaned. So a small thumbs up to the cleaners as I'm sure it wasn't easy getting it clean.,geezer76
UR118280016,2011-18-September,My husband and I stayed here for 6 nights. All we needed was a place to sleep that was clean near a bus line and was reasonably priced (in the most expensive city in the world). This was as "no frills" as it gets! But for a week in London for less than $500 US it worked! We slept showered ate our free breakfast (it's literally toast and corn flakes coffee tea and juice - that's it the same thing every day) and then we took the bus to wherever we wanted to spend the rest of the day. We returned at night checked our email using the free WiFi (which only works near the lobby bar) and called it a night. Although the staff is not that eager to help you they do help when asked. Power adapters irons hair dryers etc are available at the front desk for a 5 lb deposit. There was definitely a language barrier as few of the employees spoke English and those that did were sometimes confused by my American accent. Tips - when I checked in I specifically asked for the most modern room they had. My friend didn't and got one of the rooms that must have been the topic of the one of the horror stories posted. As long as you advocate for yourself and arrive with low expectations you'll be fine (no AC no safe no WiFi in rooms no frig etc),cohenj318
UR119454784,2011-18-October,Lower ground floor is actually 4 floors down into the recesses of the earth. it gets colder the lower you go until you find what must have been an old barn which they covered over and stuck prison cells off it. Our cell was at the end of a narrow corridor and the window looked generously out to the brick wall 4 feet away. the shabby curtains were unnecessary as there was no natural light whatsoever. Two single beds (despite booking a double) were crammed in and you had to climb over a desk to get into the bathroom. Quite why a desk is in this room is a mystery. A learning zone this is not and you'd have to squeeze your legs over the bed to sit at the desk. You have to stand on the bed to see half of yourself in the bathroom mirror over the sink. The only light is the main 100 watt overhead light. And you had to switch that on at 9.00 am due to no natural light anyway. On our return from our night out we returned to no electricity and no heating. it was freezing. Using the light from my mobile phone I located the room phone (that was a plus..) and dialled reception to get help. A man eventually arrived having strolled down the labyrinthine corridors with an ambivalence which belied that this had never happened before.. He asked for the chair from the room to stand on to untrip the switch. Job done. Waking up there was like never waking at all. We had no idea the sun shone that morning. The trip to the 5th floor in a postage stamp sized lift clearly unfit for the 100's of hapless and depressed looking guests filled me with no hope. The breakfast room was packed and the tables were stacked with dirty dishes no doubt from long departed guests. The continental breakfast comprised of cornflakes and barely toasted toast and jam. The staff stood inert grinning vacantly at everyone. It was like a scene from One Flew over the Cuckoos Nest. You had to stand around clutching your breakfast awkwardly while peering around for two chairs together to enjoy breakfast 'a duex'. Only those who know how to nab a seat on a tube train at breakneck speed were successful in thier mission. The view from the 5th floor is the ONLY redeeming feature though I'd lost the will to live by that point and seriously considered throwing myself over the edge.. They probably wouldn't have got round to cleaning up the mess for a while anyway so I thought against it. There is budget there is bargain bucket and then there is The Queens Hotel with such an incongruous name with added hilarity in naming rooms 'The Buckingham or Balmoral Suite' to add to its allure. Has anyone thought of checking to see when the last environmental or health and safety check was done? The staff may not be paid to think too deeply but for christs sake they are paid to provide a service. This place needs to be shut down the owners and management brought to the attention of investigators of a media type discipline and face the ensuing music..,Karine IW W
UR108750735,2011-18-May,Booked in to stay at the croydon park hotel which is part of the euro hotels group to which they said there was a mistake with my booking and they sent us to the queens hotel  we had traveled almost 300 miles from preston to london that day to attend a party and needed to travel back home the following day  once we arrived at the second hotel (quens hotel) they showed us 8 different rooms to choose ....all was at the rear of the hotel smelt of damp and had 6 beds in each room  it was like a hostel not a hotel  we had no choice but to stay there in the end as we had waited around for 3 hours to get from croydon to this hotel and for all the messing around  we had 2 hours to get ready for our party and to find the location as we was in a different town THERE was 1 plug socket in out room which had to be used for the tv kettle hair dryers /streightners chargers...... so we went down and ask them why to which the rude staff told us there was a sainsburys not so far away and to go and buy ourself an exstenstion  it was heptic trying to get ready  room smelt of dampdirty hall ways rude staff .!

UR114197870,2011-18-June,am a regular traveller and I stayed at Queens Palace Hotel for 1 night. I saw the picture of the room on the internet but actually the room was not upto that level. The receptionist woman was so rude . The breakfast staff was least bothered to give you anything. I will recommend even if they offer cheapest room do nt waste your money over there.,doodijee
UR119382257,2011-17-October,Please beleive every bad review you read on this place because they are so true!! This hotel is nothing better than a Flop House!! Do not waste your hard earned by staying here. No wonder they ask you to pay upfront. We had no choice as we had an emergency on. Do your research before booking. I'm sure there are better places around Crystal Palace for the same price you would pay for this doss hole.,roslin1
UR121836868,2011-17-December,Stayed there with my husband. The staff and the one I believe who is a manager is one of the rudest person. Being woken up at 8am on a Saturday morning telling us check out is at 930 when we have another four nights there. Bath products went missing from the room I went to reception to tell me housekeeping must have taken it?!! Nothing done about it. Television and heating not working. Freezing cold in the middle of winter. Also doing some building work on a Saturday evening at 2245 is a great night. Worse place we have ever stayed in.,489caz
UR108464006,2011-16-May,Find yourself somewhere else to stay! Front desk staff rude. Six single beds (3 x bunk beds) in SINGLE occupancy room. Clean bedding but mattress lumpy and uncomfortable. Thick dust on cups and saucers. TV had virtually no reception (no aerial!) despite one of the Crystal Palace TV masts being right outside. No battery cover on TV remote (which did not work anyway). TV plug fizzed in socket - very safe. Floor and therefore beds sloping in all directions. Bathroom small and dark - loo paper holder hanging off the wall. Bin completed rusted over. NO HOT WATER!!. Only one double power socket in the room of which the TV was plugged (fizzing) into one and the kettle in the other. NO ROOM SERVICE!!!!,2anon2
UR104129750,2011-15-April,Beware. This is rip-off Britain run by foreigners. Read their terms very carefully. If you book for five nights they charge for all nights up front over the phone or when you arrive and if you only stay for four they refuse to refund the fifth night even if you let them know on your first night! The staff are all foreigners and many do not speak good English. They are rude and uncaring of their guests. They are incompetent and no-one takes or has the authority to take responsibility for anything. The hotel is generally dirty and a disgrace to the hospitality profession. The rooms are tatty poorly furnished and sounds from one room travel easily to the next. The breakfast is dreadful. The main customers are builders and labourers. Some of them are scary people dirty drunk and noisy late into the night.,wideboards
UR103855063,2011-13-April,it was terrible they maked a lousy 1 person room into a 6 persons room the water wasnt working till the day we was going home and the toilet was leaking water the bumberbed was put together with duch tape and no service at all almost all from the room got a bad stomach by the food,jonathan036
UR99750674,2011-11-March,Me and my boyfriend stayed here for cheapness whilst visiting london we stayed for 2 nights and reli didnt want to. From the outside it looks not that bad you go in and the receptio aint that bad the lounge area looked a little trampy. Anyway we started to check in and the man didnt seem to know much english and wasnt exactly happy or friendly. We got our key and left to find it the hallways was dirty and smelly and hard to get your cases along. We got to our room and was both shocked it was as if they put us in basement there was a window a very thin window up near ceiling which was too high to look out of we did get a dirty stained chair to stand on to look out and behind it was a ledge and ahigh wall full of rubbish. The room was horrendous and tiny carpet all stained no wardrobe holes everywhere. the bathroom you cud hardly fit in and was dirty and no hot water. we dreaded going back to the place. wen we was leaving i was stripping the horrible sheets and was so shocked at what we had been sleeping on the matress was filthy full of blood and stains felt sick we cudnt believe it. we had paid for breakfast so we went up all way to top floor no breakfast except disgusting bread with one grill for whole hotel to make toast nowhere to sit we ended up eating it near stairway. horrible place dont go unless reli desperate actually dont go then sleep in your car or on street. i have got photos but cant find them on my laptop if anyone wants to see letme know as i want ppl to knw how bad it is,clare141
UR115227795,2011-10-July,We stayed in this hotel as a last minute option because a booking at another hotel was cancelled last minute and this hotel was the nearest to Earls Court with the availability we required to accommodate the crew of London Film and Comic Con. As we booked so many rooms we saw a LOT of rooms and none were better than the others Do not be fooled by those lovely pictures on the website as this is not what the rooms looked like. Below are a few of the 'lowlights' we experienced: * 3x Bunkbeds in our room two of which were pushed together to form a double bed but sold as single beds which ought to be illegal (if it's not already!) * Bunkbed springs collapsed when 'lightly tested' for noise * Bunkbed mattress springs poked through thin mattresses * Double bedded room - duvet did not reach both edges of the bed * Bathroom door fell off hinges when opened and had no lock. * Mould in shower and bathroom * Hallways carpets would desperately like to meet a hoover. * Sheets/mattresses/pillows/towels should not contain blood stains/rips/dirty marks/bed bugs * Hotel bar did not have any red wine. None at all!! * Only one room key is issued per room even for rooms with 6 occupants!! * Room contained a single wardrobe but this had been screwed shut. The hotel looked nice from the outside. The reception seemed clean with a huge fish tank interesting maps and tourist info. There is a bar and lounge with plenty of sofas and a HUGE television and a snooker room though the table was covered everytime I passed which dissuaded people from using it. Having read previous reviews on here about them removing luggage from the booked rooms most of us took all our valuables to Earls Court as I would sooner trust 40000 strangers than the hotel staff. Don't get me started on 'service' as reception were incapable of checking us in quickly and got into several heated arguments about the booking as it was not what we had booked and you can not expect a 6'7 man to sleep in a 5'4 bunkbed with raised bars at both ends. Hotel staff were not understanding congenial pleasant or helpful. TIP - if you are car parking get a permit from reception as they clamp cars. TIP - Rather than parking your car in the car park drive down the street to the local police station drive forcibly into a police car and the police will ensure you get better service better accommodation and better food than you will receive at this hotel!!,HRHLizzi
UR106341620,2011-1-May,My stay at this hotel was not very good at all. First of all the bathroom main light and emergency light both did not work upon arrival we requested it to be fix and took three days for action to take place. There was a desk and chair inside our room but we did not dare sit on the chair unless something had been place on top of it it had many stains and did not look as if an effort had been made to keep it clean. The curtains in the room appered to be covered with paint which I found strange see as the place was in desperate need of renovation and paint seemed to have never been taken into that room. They say that there is a hairdryer and a trouser press inside the room. The hairdryer was not there and did not appear throughout our stay and though the trouser press was present it was broken it wouldn't even come away from the wall. To get the iron you must pay a 5 deposit. There was no ironing board. There was no internet connection in the rooms you had to go down stairs to the lounge area. The room phone only dialled recption on every key there was even problems recikeving calls. The bathroom was clean to an extent the walls were a bit dirty but the tub basin and toilet were clean. The cups had steaks from the previous user. But overall at least the staff were helpfull and friendly and we had a clean bed to sleep in at night. The breakfast was basic but it was a pleasant clean area.,kberry99
UR70014125,2010-7-July,This has to be the worst hotel I have ever had the misfortune to stay in. Do not be fooled by the exterior which looks very grand at night. The inside is no more that an enormous hostel. The rooms are dreadful. I stayed with my husband and we were first given a room that was no bigger than one in a caravan. There was a double bed pushed against a wall. We were given another room which was bigger and had a king size bed. However the quilt was made for a double bed and did not fit over the bed.

UR65927963,2010-31-May,My spouse had booked a double room at this hotel paying the disposit charge of 10. On arrival we had to stand in line for over an hour waiting to be seen by a receptionist who was struggling with the most basic of English. On eventually arriving at the front desk we were told that if we had not brought with us the confirmation email then we were not able to have our room. We explained that we were not aware of this but could they just check us in obviously because it is booked through my spouses name. They refused saying that no confirmation email no room we asked if they had any spare rooms available due to we had drove a considerable distance. This was greeted with a very rude NO and they told us that there was only the 150 suites left if we wanted one. Found it quite strange that we obviously must have booked a room because the disposit charge was very quickly debited from my spouses account but there was no rooms available. Please at all cost do not go to this hotel I have travelled to many a country throughout my life and this is without a shadow of a doubt the worst rudest most unprofessional dirty hotel I have ever had the misfortune of parking my car outside.,Longlane
UR81449362,2010-29-September,I would echo many of the comments on here dirty noisy smelly etc but wanted to add a serious warning should you be a solo female traveller like me. I booked this hotel as I needed a cheap place to lay my head for about 8 hours being up in london for 2 days for work purposes. I was fully aware that the budget rate was not going to buy me anything but basic facilities and was fine with that - a blanket pillow and mattress was enough. However arriving at 11.30pm I was made to wait 30 minutes while they found my reservation which they had lost in a lobby full of fairly annebriated groups of men. I was then informed that there wasn't a key available for my room and so would have to be let into my room by a porter who had a master key. Already feeling very nervous I was then asked twice if I was expecting any 'gentlemen visitors'... pretty terrifying! Can I just clarify here that I was wearing jeans and a wooly jumper and I thought looked fairly normal and am not used to being mistaken for 'a lady of the night'. I was then lead by a porter  along with another annoyed customer who had also been told that there were no keys for the rooms through a maze of corridors to find that the 'single room' that I had booked was in fact a 4 bed room comprising of two hospital style single beds and a pair of bunk beds... bizarre! Thanking god I had actually reached my room alive (the other hotel guest who had been shown his room at the same time had already asked if I would prefer to join him instead - argh!) I was then given a lecture in broken english from the porter that if I was expecting any 'mr's' to join me I really did have to tell reception otherwise there were always fights... kind of speechless after this I just thanked him and (I have never done this before) locked the door from the inside and dragged a chair from the room to lodge against the handle. Solo female travellers please please be very careful before booking into this hotel...I felt terrified alone and had nowhere else to go - it was horrific!,millymoo123
UR72846754,2010-29-July,We rang this hotel at 9o'clock the morning of our check in who stated as we wanted to check in late it wasn't a problem they had our reservation and we could book in when ever we want. We turned up at the hotel to be told by the desk clerk that our rooms had been given away but they would find some other rooms for us to stay. We had booked 2 triple en-suites which they then tried to give us one room bearing in mind we had paid up front. We argued we wanted two rooms as this is what we had paid for. We got our key to one room and went of to find 3 bunk beds! 2 of which were not put together correctly and the screw fell out in the middle of the night the window was cracked there was a massive stain on the carpet no hairdryer as promised on the interenet about 10 used tissues on the floors under the beads and 2 out of the 3 of us left with insect bites! The second room although clean there was no key! The security guard had to keep letting them in and out and the bed was pressed against a cooker!! Health and saftey at its finest! On Complaining that night we were asked to come back in the morning as the hotel manager would then be able to see us. Morning came and we went for our continental breakfast which consisted of coco pops and toast! We then saw a man ina suit doing nothing more than shouting at the staff and then raised his voice at a guest as she dared to ask him a question. This fine example of customer service was Peter Gonda the hotel manager! When we began to complain to him we also stated the way he spoke to his staff was rude in which he wished us a nice stay and wouldn't hear the rest of our complaint! When speaking with his deputy the best she could do was promise we wouldn't incure these problems on our next stay! I would never ever recommend this hotel and for anyone considering booking it please rememeber this!,Paige787
UR62684854,2010-28-April,Booked this by accident. The place is literally falling apart. I have no idea how this place hasn't been shut down for health and safety reasons. I could list the bad points but there are too many. It's cheap though and reception were quite friendly (until there was a problem with no electricity in 2 rooms then they hung up!). Oh it smells too. Basically - GO SOMEHERE ELSE,DMS888
UR57200455,2010-26-February,This hotel is basically for very low end business users. Its full of gas engineer types air con fitters and the tattoo & tracksuit brigade. Its most probably the cheapest hotel in the area which has suitable parking for work vans. (Drive in through the right hand entrance which is officially the exit go straight up to the gate directly in front and push the buzzer. There is a large secure parking area out the back of the hotel). The chap on reception had the air of a man who knew just how poor this hotel was and had long since gone beyond caring. He had obviously grown comfortably numb to the nightly stream of complaints regarding the condition of the rooms and had adopted a stock response of a cursory shrug of the shoulders and a casual handing over of a different set of keys without a single decipherable word passing through his lips. Breakfast was not good. I like the rest of my colleagues and numerous other guests had arrived downstairs only to be told that breakfast was in fact being served on the top floor of the hotel. It probably wasn't worth the effort to get there. It consisted of a rather poor selection of continental style offerings with an optional extra 4.95 payable for a cooked alternative. I waited for the inattentive waiter to leave the room and then simply helped myself without paying. My guilt was purged by the fact that I only managed one or two mouthfuls before returning to the sanctuary of the cereals. Final verdict: If you're arriving late getting up early and budget is an issue then you probably won't be overly disappointed. Places to eat: Avoid the hotel restaurant. Found a great place called Noodle Time which is a left turn out of the hotel and a few hundred metres down the road. Portions are big staff are friendly and price is ludicrously cheap. We honestly couldn't see how they make any money at all.,Hollywoodhoff
UR62401122,2010-25-April,This is without doubt the worst hotel I have stayed at in 35 years of travel. My self and two of my best friends were staying before the London Marathon and hoping for a restful stay not a chance. The hotel is dirty No kettle? TV next to useless Curtains torn and ripped hence unable to cover window. U/S Shower and much more. The staff is best described as rude I would go as far as to say next to useless. The best thing (sarcasm) is that if you are on the ground floor rooms you get to listen to music until 3am as we did. IF there is a function your room will be directly above it and forget sleep . Like I say do not be tempted and heed my warning this is the worst hotel of its kind DO NOT STAY you have been warned there are far better for the same price,gingergooner
UR68148224,2010-21-June,Mt continental family booked this hotel to stay i took them there- the room shown was terrible dirty & smelly no window opened after complaining to uninterested receptionists we were offered another room- this time the interior room was clean and spacious the corridors and stairs horrid i wanted my family to come home with me there and then what a terrible impression for people to see of england please dont think that we would stay there we know of better and cheaper places to stay,snadraisabella
UR56570005,2010-20-February,Looking at the website the hotel looks very good used laterooms.com to secure a twin room with en-suite facilities and continental breakfast for 40 for two of us....warning bells should have rung!! The room was located in an annexe which we had to climb up and down and up numerous stair to get to. The room like like a student bed sit with strip lighting and no bed side lamps. There was cooking facilities and a kettle and a nice peice of paper informing us which numbers to ring to get various hotel services....only problem no phone in the room. The double bed was unmade and looked like it had been slept in and there was a wet towel on the floor. We looked round for the en-suite and found it located outside in the corridor with our room number written on in pen! But the room was clean. As it was so late when we booked in and the thought of tackling all of those stairs and the unhelpful staff on reception we decided to accept our lot. During the night there were some very strange noises pipes clanking and a generator coming on and off. We were not surprised at the paltry offering for breakfast the next morning they ran out of juice at 07.45 and the english breakfast at an extra 4.95 each looked as tired as we did. I did try to point out the hotels failings as we left but was treated to the same unhelpful off handed service as we recieved the previous night.,HunnieBunnie
UR85757018,2010-2-November,having attended our sons wedding in penge it was recommended to us to stay at this so called hotel .on booking in we were given some vague instructions on how to get to our room which we eventually found . the carpets in the room were stained the walls were in need of some paint no plug in the bathroom sink the kettle only worked if you held it down ( then it turned itself on during the night ? )the tv had no aerialand for some strange reason they decided to illuminate the front of the building with massive floodlights it was like trying to sleep on a summers day with the curtains open(if i owned this place i would turn the lights off to try and hide it ) .Going up for " breakfast" next morning we were greated by a free for all and judging by other reviews im glad we beat a hasty retreat .Unfortuately our son and his new wife stayed in the same " hotel " they paid three times as much as us and got a room in the same state and all they received when they complained was a very mild apology and no offer of compensation at all basically so what weve got your money now go away. If ever were in the area again well sleep in the car its more comfortable.,somersetrebelpaul
UR63016011,2010-2-May,Well what Can I say. This is the worst hotel i have ever stayed in - by a long shot. I have done 2 star seaside B & B's and hostels but this takes the buscuit. We booked as it was near and event we had on and as it had 3 stars thought i would be basic (and it was cheap)On arriving the staff were rude and annoyed with me that i didnt have my booking ref although she found it when she made a whole 30 secs of effort. Alarm bells were ringing on the way down to our room (basement type hovel) On opening the door of the room I felt like crying. The carpets and bathroom were dirty and smelly. The Bedding consisted of a dirty stained duvet with no cover and a dirty throw. Only saving grace was clean sheets on the bed. the bed was a 3/4 bed with two pillows. there was a nosy fridge and a dirty cooker(?) The furniture was falling apart and there was nail clippings everywhere. As we had less than an hour until our family do we decided to get ready and deal with it. on the way out I asked the receptioinst for a pile of clean sheets to be left on the bed so we could use them to sleep in. She was rude and never offered to address the problem of the gobsmacking state of the bedding provided. (although we did get a glimpse of the linen room which got me even more upset about the hygiene) My evening was ruined by the thought of staying at the hotel. I am 7 months pregnant and was kept up by the nose of the fridge in the room. I avoided breakfast like the plauge (although my brother did say they went to a nosey and it was also horrific) and didn't even follow with my plans in London I was so tired and upset. partly hormone induced I'm sure but a clean bed and standard hygiene was all we were asking for. And no I didnt even have a shower but i did wash my face with cold water from the hot tap!!! Who on earth would give this hotel a good review maybe it was one of the foriegn gents visiting the receptionists smoking and drinking out of cans!! I did complain but I was in a queue on that front and I think it happens every day!!!,trixie262
UR71388791,2010-18-July,Booked into the Queens Hotel yesterday evening after watching the football . Had to ask four people in reception to check in. Was told that only one computer was working. First they made a mistake by charging me double on my card for which I had to refund me when I pointed out the mistake. Then after near half hour got our key cards. I had a single ensuite room which was clean but with two set of bunk beds a cooker and a fridge( maybe my friend said we have to cook our own breakfast!!). After a evening out in Crystal Palace we went back to the hotel and I got back into my room but my friend struggled to get in his room.It turns that his room had been given to a bunch of foreign students!!! So went to seek the manager who sorted it out but the buck stays with him and at the bar was going to refuse my Scottish 20 until i mentioned it is legal tender.,eagles111169
UR56414117,2010-18-February,You do only get what you pay for we paid 35 per night for a double good price little did we know. We did not check tripadvisor before we went. Checked in but they could not find one of the room bookings but sorted it out so lucky for us we had the two rooms we booked. Both rooms were of equal poor quality. Before we got to the rooms the corridors were filthy doors had big holes in them were latchs were. when we got to our room we opended the door to find bleach marks on the carpet in front of the ensuite. the wall lights were hanging off the walls only one had a shade and only one worked. Wallpaper coming off the walls window sill had a lot of paint missing on it. Iron marks on the only chair we had. The flat screen tv did not have an aerial so did not have reception. The ensuite was disgusting the tiles around the bath had come off at some point and someone had try to put them back with mastic put on with finger I think as it was a mess the ceramic soap dish at the side of the bath was smashed so it had sharp edges on it the taps had the chrome worn off them the taps did not turn off properly toilet handle was hanging off. The exterior of the hotel has recently been painted white but ther are big cracks in the exterior walls. My daughters room was just as bad. If it was not for the fact we were going to a family funeral the following day we would have walked out.,trevmaster
UR90046384,2010-16-December,First night - stayed in the basement room with skirting missing and a small furry friend we moved rooms the next day had little sleep. The second night at 1am loud banging on the door the door opened and the African security guard stood there weilding a cricket bat and shouting "Come quickly! You must come! See what they have done to your van! " We headed out to the car park with other van drivers looking confused the security guard pointed at the hand prints which he claimed were theives trying to break in but there was no damage and nothing stolen. We tryed sleeping afterwards we had a long day ahead of us. After going to work and returning at 10pm i approached reception to complain the Pakistani receptionist was totally unhelpful20 minutes later the deputy manager appeared with the security guard and they stood there lyingdenying and evading things when suddenly 5 hoodies stormed the reception assauting staff making threats and demanding money receptionists were throttled and launched over the counter the safe in the office was raided and they made off all this time and our security guy nowhere to be seen ! 12:30am banging on the door again guess who "Did you see what they did ?!!" "You see what they do to his face ?!! " What i said i'd rather not repeat here - this place is a nuthouse  enter at your own risk.,ming27
UR89893748,2010-15-December,When you cut enough corners your square will turn into a circle. The basics have surely been missed here. The reception staff are far more interested in taking the up-front payment than anything else. I personally think that no member of staff here have ever ventured on to a management course and if they did they have surely forgotten everything they were told. The cleanliness standard of the room was extremely poor - especially the bathroom - again the minimum was done to qualify it as a hotel room. A mains wire from the television dangled for about 4 feet before being spliced together by insulation tape near to the plug point and the TV had no remote control to operate it. There were two doubles and one single bed in my room ? I ordered a double only as one person so why would I need three beds ? My refreshment area consisted of all the necessary ingredients but the kettle itself - maybe I was expected to us the hot tap instead. The 'wardrobe' was just an open closet with a bar which was dusty and smelled like it hadn't been cleaned since the Victorian period. Breakfast time and we were instructed by staff upon arrval that it is situated on the top floor - two dispensers of cornflakes and milk a tray of bread slices with a toaster in the corner two vending machines preapring coffee tea and hot chocolate were placed on tables in one corner cooked breakfasts were available if you could actually find a member of staff but then again if you're English speaking there will be a considerable language barrier. Cheap tablecloths on cheap tables surrounded with a view of cracked plaster on walls punched holes in doors and a dirty floor - not what you want a breakfast time. It is a clear indication that this room had not been prepared for a guest but reset to it's basic format for a lodger . Such a disappointment from what you expect when you arrive and see the outside shell of an impressive Victorian built hotel - the complete interior does not live up to the advertisement it shows. I can only think that this is a hotel that leans itself towards housing the people on social benefit and tries to squeeze as many in as possible to get the maximum amount of money out whilst putting the last amount of effort in.,Q22Q17
UR87057694,2010-14-November,This is the first review I have ever written and I'm not the sort of person to complain usually but I do feel that anyone who is considering staying at this hotel deserves an honest and accurate review of this appalling hotel. I used to live in Crystal Palace so I know the area very well. I read the reviews for this hotel (which were pretty bad) but it was cheap and I wanted a night out in London so I booked this hotel all the same. Although I had very low expectations given the previous reviews I was shocked by the state of this hotel. I paid 39 for a single room (which is very cheap for London) and I still feel that I have been ripped off. The Room The room was effectively in a basement bars across the windows no furniture in the room and generally very run down and depressing. There was a small TV in the room with 4 channels but the remote control didn't work and the tiny areal on top of the TV had a very poor reception. There were holes in the carpets and a single hand towel which was supposed to double up as a bath towel. I was given two very small sachets of shampoo which was nowhere near adequate. The bed had a single sheet for a duvet and the walls were so thin that when someone walked down the corridor outside my room my whole bed would literally vibrate. I'm NOT a light sleeper but this still kept me awake all night. I don't think it was just my room other reviewers have also commented on this. The only way to describe or compare the room and the general condition of the hotel is something similar to the horror hotel programmes you see on TV. I need to point out that I have stayed in hotels and hostels all over the world and this is by far the worst I have ever stayed in. However I did say that I would provide an honest and accurate review so the three good things about this hotel is the location as it's near 2 train stations (Gipsy Hill and Crystal Palace) and it's on the night bus route if you want a night out in London. Secondly my room did have hot water and finally it does have free parking which not many hotels in London offer. Breakfast Breakfast is included in the price however this simply consists of toast (white bread only) and a couple choices of cereal. The orange juice was so watered down it barely resembled orange juice. It certainly shouldn't sway your decision to stay here Crystal Palace does have some nice cafes which serve good breakfast. My Recommendation Like I said I used to live in Crystal Palace so I know the area very well. My recommendation is to stay at the Jury's Inn hotel in Croydon (approx 3 miles away). On average it's about 10 more but it's definitely worth it. Don't worry I don't work for the hotel :-) but it's in an excellent location in terms of transport links into London it's opposite a shopping centre and the rooms and breakfast are far superior. The only downside is that you do have to pay for parking but if you arrive after 6pm you only need to pay 3. I hope you found this review useful. :-),Smale_6
UR83244003,2010-12-October,How this place is still open is an absolute mystery. Genuinely the worst hotel in the history of the civilised world. Noisy falling to bits poor staff who don't care fire alarms that go off all through the might every night... you'll wish you had shelled out a few extra quid to stay in the B&B next door Or anywhere frankly except this hellhole.,jerrywexler
UR70615065,2010-12-July,I booked this as a cheap getaway with a girlfriend and wish I hadn't! As I am a travel agent I know not to trust every review and I tend not to bother where I stay as long as it is clean. I called the hotel previously to request a nice CLEAN room as I was a bit worried after reading the reviews on here. When we arrived there everything was fine at check in got to the room and me & my friend had to laugh we had booked a triple room but unfortunately one of the girls couldnt come just as well really because there was only 2 double beds. The room was dated & flung together. We're not fussy though as we were there for a boozy weekend except when we needed to charge our phones & the plug sockets were not working and one was hanging off the wall. Not to mention the used contraception on the floor we found behind the bed when checking for other plug sockets. YUCK!!! The bathroom had hairs all over it aswell. We called reception to get someone to look at it and they advised someone would be straight up 15 mins later we called again and again they apologised and said they were sending someone up 45 MINUTES later I eventually went down and asked what was going on the receptionist apologised and said they were really busy with weddings etc so anyway it ended up no-one came up at all which we were disgusted at. We actually ended up taking our phones down to reception about half an hour later and making them charge them down there. All in all it done us for the weekend but I would NEVER stay here again or recommend it to anyone. There is Crystal Palace train station about 10 minutes walk away from the hotel which was handy but I would definately stay somewhere else next time I visit London.,littlelegs90
UR79137302,2010-11-September,OMG I dont know where to start this is the worse hotel I ever been too. on arrival we came at 7am because we came from far we ask for a room with a bubble bed they said they dont have none but they have single rooms with bump beds we decided to take that one but we paid for a bubble bed room and was meant to change in to a dabble room later on in the day witch never happen the lady on the reception told my ms to have a look at the room before paying (NOW THATS SAYING SOME THING) On the way to the room the true colures of the hotel started to show there was a damp smell in the hall ways to the rooms and the walls where all coming off when we got in the room there was 4 single beds a TV with only 5 channel with bad signal two electric plugs in the hole room croton dint even meet up when closing them we went for breakfast and was shock to see how it look the toaster dint work rite we order 2 full English the waiter said we have to pay first but he still place the order and we didnt even pay for the breakfast it was so crap and unorganised later on in the day we went to the bar and got ovary charged order some food and the chirps was soft and gone off later on i went back to the bar got a packet of chirps witch was out of date. in the morning the house keeping keep knocking on the door knowing that we have 1houre left till check out there is so much more but I dont have the time just dont go there because you will not have a good time from what Ive seen with other guest the staff are not help full as all no smiley faces very very very CRAP HOLTEL ADVOID IT IF YOU CAN.,travil
UR82956648,2010-11-October,Well how do i start this review? we were looking for a cheap place to stay in london for one night mearly as a place to rest our heads over our busy weekend. First impressions of the hotel were fine when we arrived at the hotel the staff were friendly we were given our room and key card straight away. We then had a long trek through the maze of corridoors and stairs (i can only describe the decor as 'the shining' like) when we eventually got to our room all seemed fine but the problems were yet to start. Apparently our room shared a wall with a busy corridoor which shook everytime someone walked passed the kettle in our room was broken the mattress was stained there was mould on the lamps there was dubious white stains on the chair the shower was unable to keep constant temperature the curtains were hanging off there was no wardrobe the 'double' bed was two singe beds pushed together and there was no room service or wake up call service (unlike we were promised when booking the hotel). But honestly this was nothing in comparison to what we hd in store for us. In the morning we were awoken by a dripping noise assuming it was from a neighbouring room we ignored it and went for our 'continental' breakfast (which included stale bread you had to toast yourself a large tub of cornflakes in which i did witness a man cough into while serving himself some and tea and coffee but there were no cups so we were unable to have any) so hastily leaving the breakfast area hungry and thirsty we went back to our room to pack our things only to find the dripping noise we had head earlier was the sound of our ceiling leaking water onto the table and nearby plug socket. Phoning reception i asked for someone to be sent down immediately to assess the problem. Half an hour went by and still no one had arrived and the leak was getting much worse and a large crack was now appearing in the ceiling. I phoned reception again and was told to "stop being silly and someone was on their way" very ubruptly and rudely. When someone finally turned up we recieved no appology and were simply told to ''get out of the room". On checking out feeling angry about the service hotel room and attitude from staff i made a complaint only to be told there was nothing they could do about it and we were given no appology. We were however offered a discount off our next stay! I doubt we will accept.,discoraverbehaver
UR74818201,2010-11-August,this place needs shutting down and a full revamp. most of the staff do not have a grasp of basic english booked a twin room that had a kick hole in the wall but at least sheets were clean bathroom disgusting the corriders around the hotel are frightning paid for full english breakfast but that is apparently coco pops or make your own toast it looks ok from the outside but enter at your own risk,derbysign
UR63740643,2010-10-May,i have a 4yr old and a 5 month old. we booked the hotel just to sleep in when we got there we had requested a cot online as well as ringing up an requesting one there was not one in our room. the first room we were given was disgusting. 1) booked a triple room not a room with 3 lots of bunk beds. 2) one lot of the bunk beds had no bed guards on the top bunk 3) the second bunk bed was across the window and only had 1 side with bed guards the side next to the window had none. 4) the third bunk bed the ladder was half hanging off. 5) the window had a crack in it. 6) on the window ledge outside therewas a cup of ciggerette butts. they moved us when we went and complained. we were given the room that we had booked online. we never did get the cot for my baby still though. definately not safe and child friendly would not even recommend this place to a pack of wild animals let alone any human being.,lilnorfolkfamily
UR46385941,2009-9-October,Yes it's cheap but believe me it's a false economy staying here. The room was scruffy and basic but habitable though a lot of the electrics were really dodgy. The beds were old and the radiators were on full blast despite it being warm outside. Luckily we managed to turn it off. The phone in the room didn't work. We were woken up THREE times during the night by fire alarms - at 5 7 and 8 a.m. Extremely loud and frightening as the bells are right by the beds. There was no information given about this except that people had supposedly been smoking in their rooms. The second time they could not switch the very old and flaky alarm system off and the car park and lobby were full of confused bleary eyed guests who had no idea what do to. Everyone was very angry and one woman said that the previous night it had happened FOUR times. The staff seemed to think this was perfectly normal and not their problem. We stayed only one night and didn't stay for breakfast as we really just wanted to get out of there. I originally wrote a very harsh review but in hindsight it's better to ask some serious questions. I have to wonder if this place has ever been inspected. I cannot see how it could pass even a basic safety check. With the alarm going off several times every night if there is a real fire nobody will take it seriously. The manager was on duty at 10 p.m when we arrived and still there at 11 a.m when we left. he looked knackered and really didn't seem to care about anything. I wish I had seen these reviews before I booked. Like most people I saw the price and the pictures and thought well why not. And while it's cheap it's a massive gamble staying at this hotel. Certainly I would never go back there. The place needs a really serious safety inspection and a massive change in staff attitudes.,traveller222222
UR23403817,2009-9-January,We arrived to check in at 14h30 to be told that check in was only at 15h00. Our booking said 14h00. We came back later to find that the two rooms that we had booked were on different floors. We were 3 adults and 2 children. We also booked a quad room and a double room. The rooms they gave us were each with a single bed and a double bed. One of our children would have to sleep in another room. Was told that there were no other rooms available. When we first got to our room exhausted we walked in on a couple who were already in bed. They had double booked us in the same room. Finally we got rooms next to one another and found that there were no duvet covers on the beds and stains on all the linen. The wind was howling through the windows and we couldn't get warm. When we complained the next morning we were told that maintenance would be in to look at the windows. We also requested covers on our duvets and clean sheets and more blankets none of which we got. They did not repair the window and did not have enough blankets to cover all their rooms. Everyone in the hotel was complaining. Never again!!!! It was cheap but also nasty.....,Poofit

UR31790201,2009-7-June,I was attending my sister's wedding in the locality and booked the hotel a month before the wedding. However the day before I was due to check in I rang to confirm I could have an early check in (they won't normally check in before 3pm even though check out is at 11am) as the wedding was at 3. They'd lost my booking!!!! After a brief discussion with an incredibly unhelpful manager and me having to email them a copy of my reservation confirmation they called me back with my reservation number and reluctantly confirmed I could check in from 1pm. On arrival at the hotel at 1.15 we were initially told no rooms were ready but then they miraculously found a room that was. We were given directions on how to find it but were not warned about the obstacle course we'd have to pass to reach it!!! Very poorly lit corridors with unmarked slopes in the floor and unmarked steps resulted in me tripping and bashing my arm on a wall. When we eventually found the room it had 3 single beds when I'd booked a double bed. So back we went to reception. Guess what.... they don't have an accident book and I couldn't see any details regarding their public liability insurance displayed anywhere. Despite this I made a written statement about the accident the receptionist signed it and I was given a copy being assured the Security Officer would record details of the accident in the appropriate records. Personally I'm not convinced this will happen. Although the receptionist was as helpful as she could be it was clear the manager really didn't give a damn about his patrons - we overheard him telling the desk staff that he didn't care whether there were weddings going on check in was at 3pm and not before and it was tough if there weren't rooms ready when geusts arrived. Well anyway we're now nearing 2pm - just about the time we needed to get the taxi to the wedding venue - and we're finally given what was described as 'a lovely room'. Yes it was clean yes it was a double but was it 'lovely'?... not as far as I am concerned! The room was at the front of the hotel which faces onto a very busy road and the windows were not even double glazed. The bathroom was functional at best - the plug hole in the sink was full of hairs and the paint was peeling off where the bathroom was quite clearly damp. Needless to say we did not spend more time than necessary in the room choosing only to sleep in there and we waited until we'd got home this morning to shower! My sister - the bride - suffered a similar yet perhaps worse experience. She too had called on Friday to confirm an early check in only to find once she got there that her room wasn't ready and she had to put her wedding dress on in the hotel toilets!!!!!! Please please please please DO take note of all the other poor reviews on here and really do give this place a miss. Your health and safety just isn't worth the risk.,Foxy1509
UR29483123,2009-6-May,Months ago me and my girlfriend booked a double room for 3 days in the Crystal Palace hotel. The comments and reviews on THIS site were not very promising but we thought that for just 3 days it cannot get that severe. Once we arrived at the hotel our first impression was not that bad. But just as we asked for a room we realized that something strange and caotic is happening in this hotel. The employees at the reception had difficulties with assigning the rooms and finally we got a room with 6 beds in the basement next to noisy and loud party people (they were up till 4 or 5 am!!! - perfect conditions for a London trip with sightseeing :-/ ). Keep in mind we booked months ago! You can imagine that the organization in this hotel is horrible. Furthermore the room we got assigned was not cleaned the beds were dusty light bulbs and toilet paper were missing and the telephone was broken. Also the window was locked so we couldn't even have fresh air. But have a look at the fotographs in the attachments! And by the way: don't expect to get breakfast in the hotel! No plates no cups no place to sit down but unfriendly staff... By the way getting from the center of London to the hotel took us almost 1 hour by bus.,traveler2998
UR23275975,2009-5-January,We booked this hotel as we were going to London for New Years Eve and this hotel was cheap and relatively close to the centre of London. After booking through lastminute.com I double checked our reservation the day before and this was confirmed. Much to our disappointment on arrival at the 'cheap' hotel we were told that reservation had been double booked and then told that our alternative hotel was in Croydon......... this ruined our entire New Year as we could not arrange alternative transport routes to reach the centre on London. Once reaching our alternative 'Premier Inn' in Croydon we found that 40+ other people were also 'double booked'. I WOULDN'T EVER BOOK AT THIS HOTEL TO PLAN A NIGHT OUT!!,excitedtraveller81
UR45811959,2009-4-October,We stayed one night in this awful hotel - the room needed gutting and re-plastering and redecorating. The curtains were a joy to behold with them hanging off the curtain rail and torn. The en-suite had dripping and limescale-encrusted taps a shower that you had to hold to ensure that water would be directed at you and not at the wall. There was a hole in the door and like the bedroom the walls had dents and dirty marks all over. The service in the restaurant was poor to an extreme most of the tables had not been cleared from previous guests - we just felt that we were not welcome. True the room was cheap but we did expect cleanliness rather than a room that looked as if it had been in a war zone. Thank goodness we only had to stay one night - I thought inspectors had to vet hotels - I think if this hotel was vetted it would be closed down.,nathanWestSussex
UR39344798,2009-31-August,We booked five rooms for two nights as we were in London for a wedding which was being held in Dulwich so the location was very convenient. We were advised on booking that the hotel was under refurbishment and that we would be staying in the newly refurbished rooms only one of the rooms out of the five had been refurbished. On arrival they asked for payment upfront on reflection the warning bells should have rung then. Our rooms were in different parts of the hotel not together as we would have liked my partner and I was put in the basement which was uncomfortabley warm. The room was tiny to the point that we couldn't move around it at the same time. It also had one small window in the corner therefore making it very dark. There were stains/marks on the walls and celling which were disgusting and we couldn't tune the tv in properly. The first night the toilet cistern would not fill up properly and was running like a tap all night which kept me awake. I got up early the next morning to have a shower which was cold. When I went to the reception desk to tell them about the shower they said there was a problem with the boilers something that I had realised myself during my cold shower. I also informed them of the noisy toilet to which they said they would have someone from maintenance look at it in 10 minutes I did not see anyone from maintenance they must have fixed it while we were out at the wedding. The boiler was fixed later that morning but that was too late for me as I had an appointment with they hairdresser and had to be ready early. Breakfast was included in the fee however I would not have eaten there if it had been the last restaurant on Earth the rooms had dirty walls so god know what the kitchen would have been like! My pregnant step-sister had the delight of not being able to open the window in her room as the kitchen staff had put chicken outside to rot right by her window which smelt terrible. She asked them to move it which they didn't so as a results only opened the window as she left which would have been a nice smell for the cleaners maybe they would have done something about it then. She also did not have a plug in her bath therefore having to improvise. My 85 year old Grandmother also did not have a plug in her sink which she found very inconvenient . To conclude the staff are not helpful and the hotel is dirty the only redeeming factor was the location in relation to our wedding. If I could offer advise to anyone it would be do not under any circumstances stay at this hotel.,racqattack
UR48144666,2009-30-October,I've stayed three nights at this hotel. The room was not that bad. It was clean. Don't expect much from this hotel but for a cheap stay that's ok. I would stay again,fjeron
UR48395132,2009-3-November,Booked this hotel via Booking.com - previous reviews on TripAdvisor not great but we wanted somewhere cheapish in this area. Room 45 allocated - lower ground floor. Very warm room - possibly over the boiler room. Odd smell in corridor may have been from the laundry. Lots of bedlinen in corridor when we arrived but this was removed later. Room very basic worktop not finished no remote on TV very little hanging space considering room had a double and a single bed. Washbasin very badly cracked cold water tap difficult to turn on and water eventually came in big spurt very difficult to turn off again fully. toilet seat was not properly fixed floor covering was lifting through being wet. Water was very hot (not a complaint). On using the over-bath shower the shower head assembly came apart - this must have been noticeable when the room was serviced but we had to ask at reception to get it sorted which it was when we returned the following day. No grab rails on bath or wall - an accident waiting to happen. We only went up to the 5th floor breakfast room once and that was too often. Breakfast was very limited - a few cereals or prunes tea coffee and bread for toasting. Fruit juice was available - we tried and left the apple juice which was very diluted and tasted of very little. Other rooms here may have been better but we had a pretty miserable experience in fact we left a day early. Hotel is part of Euro Hotels group - not a good advert for the chain.,hollandNorthDevon
UR33334360,2009-27-June,Upon arriving at this hotel we were led down a mouldy rabbit warren of corridors and stairs to our room having to drag our luggage with no offer of assistance from indifferent staff. Wet paint slightly quenched the smell of vomit on the carpet which I nearly stood in. The first room of many had no windows basically a basement with it's damp moudly smell. We were horrified as they pointed to bunk beds crammed into the corner something not even mentioned prior to arrival. Unsure of the legal breaches the hotel was surely making we demanded another room and hotel staff were uniterested and argumentative. One morning as were trying to exit the hotel we nearly got locked in the stairwell which we had to use due to there being an insufficient number of lifts for the amount of other unfortunate guests in the hotel. As for location I am not even quite sure that this hotel is still located in London. To get to the centre of the city was a 15 minute walk down the road to the bus stop which took us to a train station which was approximately 40 minutes. Somewhat tiring to do every day. DON'T STAY HERE!!,NewZealandEB
UR38534659,2009-23-August,went to London to visit new grandson. stayed 1 night at the queens hotel the following day when i got home i started itching on my arms.at the time didn't take much notice. after day or so developed lots of bites. i eventually went to my GP and a and ewas given tablets.think in all been to hospital 4 or 5 times. my arm swelled up really badly and my hand.was eventually told i had been bitten by bed bugs. when i checked my bed discovered bed bugs.have since had to buy new bed and carpet.,mcguinness_1
UR49845665,2009-22-November,It was my 30th Birthday so my friends and I decided to rough it one night so we could have a lovely night out in London. On walking into the crowded reception we were pleasantly suprised. After waiting about 20mins to get to the desk the receptionist tried to check us in. We were half way through when a very very rude and unimpressed customer came and threw his weight around so we had to wait another few minutes while another member of staff tried to sort him out. We eventually got to our rooms or in this case more like army barracks but minus the cleanliness.The bedding seemed clean but that was the only bonus of the room. The next morning we went up to enjoy our 'Continental breakfast'... I use that phrase losely! It was really funny. A whole crowd of people waiting in line to make their toast on the single toaster (there was another one but it didn't work). The rest of breakfast was jam and butter and a variety of cereal. There was also a choice of coffee tea and some juice. My sister had some apple juice which must have been diluted 1 part apple juice to 3 parts water. Yuck! After joining another couple on one of the remaining big tables and having some toast and butter I decided to have a cup of coffee. I was just about to pour the milk into my cup when very rude waitor told me that the buffet area was closing so I nodded and said 'okay' and continued pouring my milk he then repeated himself more forcefully this time... I was gob smacked... and started laughing I mean what do you do when someone says that and you are already retreating from the table. I should have just put my coffee down and walked away maybe? It was absolutely hilarious!!! When we went back to the rooms my friends card wouldn't work so she went back down to the reception to get it sorted out. Guess who came rushing through throwing his toys again... the same man from the day before. Anyway we were really glad to be out of there. I looked at the photos of the hotel again and laughed some more... The pictures are NOTHING like the rooms we got. I wouldn't recommend this hotel at all!!!,HotelGoer123England
UR38454807,2009-22-August,What an awful experience 1. dirty nappies left in the corridors 2. Dirty and unkempt smelling of fried food on the ground level 3. Naked light fittings in the bathroom 4. Curtains half hanging off windows 5. cracked sink with a plug hole that was a gaping black hole only 6. Plumbing pipes were rusty  mouldy and totally unacceptable 7. Bathroom door would not shut properly at there were lumps taken out of the wood 8. door runner had screws that were sticking up out of the floor 9. Bed was rock hard 10 Thumping music playing until midnight 11 Breakfast room untidy and tables not made up not enough room for number of guests 12 Breakfast very basic not what u call continental at all On complaining to management the manager said "WHAT DO U EXPECT FOR WHAT U PAID FOR" he then proceeded to escort me to another room and disturbed some guests that were already in situ to show me their room although this was better than the room that I was in it was still not to a very high standard. Reception staff were quite argumentative and took my comments and my photographic evidence personally and as someone else who made a review said they were too busy answering the phone than to deal with guests who were standing at reception. As for the comment made on another review GET OVER IT WHILST PAYING BUDGET RATE. Certain standards should always be met whether u pay ten pounds or 100 pounds. THIS HOTEL DOES NOT OFFER ANY KIND OF DECENT SET STANDARDS LET ALONE ANY RATINGS WHATSOVER. DO NOT STAY HERE,simplythebest1
UR39618430,2009-2-September,worst hotel i have ever put my foot in. smelt on arival staff looked dirty and gruby.was given a room could not belive my eyes dirty gruby room wallpaper hangin off wallbed sheets blood stained  pubic hairs in bed refused to stay demanded money back walked out WHAT A DUMP DONT DIO IT DONT STAY HOTEL FROM HELL,zoomenter
UR42131874,2009-16-September,We booked this hotel through Greenbee and expected a certain standard. We were bitterly disappointed as the room bore no resemblance to the one shown on the website. There were electrical cables and sockets hanging from the walls the decoration was in an awful state and the furniture and bedding looked as if they had come from a 'tip'. There was only one single dim light hanging from the ceiling...... I could go on. We asked the staff if they could change our room but they said they were full. We had booked three weeks earlier so it wasn't a last minute booking. We had no where else to stay that evening and needed to be in Crystal Palace so we stayed but we couldn't get away fast enough the next morning. We didn't stop for breakfast! The experience was quite upsetting.,hotelreviewDevon
UR51163234,2009-13-December,We are just back from two days in this hotel and i read the reviews before i went and thought well its cheap so i'll just give it a try but it really wasn't worth it. It is mainly Asain and Pakastin staff and they are very rude and have no time for british people. We arrived and 12 Oclock and were told we couldn't leave our bags until 2 oclock then when our baby made noise the man at reception came and said he would give us a room right away because we were causing a disturbance (simply a baby babbling). Our room was tiny it had two single beds and a bunk bed but it was extremely small and it had a bed at the window which isn't safe for a four year old. The room was very old fashioned and grubby. The breakfast is either toast or cereal if you want a fry you have to pay an extra 4.95 a complete rip off and the juice is seriously watered down and tastes rotten. And the travelling to and from London is crazy and the oyster cards don't work to crystal palace station so you have to pay 4.10. To go to London you get a train from Crystal Palace station and travel for about 30 minutes to victoria station then get the underground to whichever main part of London you wnat to go to it all in all takes about an hour. I really would advise against this hotel with all the travel costs just pay a little extra and stay nearer london or in a premier inn or travellodge. Oh and the hotel says it has a resturant but we only seen it open at breakfast we tried thoughout the day but it was always closed. And there is no eatting places to nearby. HORRIBLE HOTEL,julieannchapman16
UR27874666,2009-12-April,Rooms too hot so windows have to be opened which lets the noise in of a jumbo passing over every 2 min. Three channels on the TV. Whole room on a slant. Key cards worked in day but not in the morning. Pool Table over priced. Photos on website do not reflect reality. Steady stream of people interested in a room for only two hours... Out of date website (2005). No wifi. Nice location close to resteraunts shops supermarket ect.,will62
UR48262527,2009-1-November,I had read the reviews and was filled with trepidation when enroute to the Queens Hotel Crystal Palace but as it was cheap I was more than prepared to "rough it" for one night. To all outward appearances it seemed a pleasant enough place although the Reception staff weren't overly eager to please or make their guests feel welcome. I felt that the Receptionist was over-worked and under seige from some of my fellow guests at the time I arrived so I gave her the benefit of the doubt. The room appeared ok a bit shabby but it had everything I needed. The electrics were definitely dodgy with sockets hanging off the wall so I was very glad I didn't have any young children staying with me. The curtains were ugly but covered the window adequately. The bedding could have done with a hot wash in Vanish to shift the well set staining! However the bed was comfy and that's really all you need. All in all I felt relieved that the place really wasn't too bad. I have to report though that my relief was very short-lived! I spent a dreadful night in that place. The noise from the nearby Games Room was horrendous and I suspect the guests in the room above were rearranging the furniture from 2am til 5.30! Having had precious little sleep I was finally flooded out of my bed at 7am! I can only surmise the guests in the room directly above mine had flooded their bath and the water cascaded through my ceiling light fitting straight on to my bed. They obviously had a functioning bath plug in their room which was more than could be said for mine! (No bath plug. I had to use the top off a milk carton being a resourceful girl! The shower didn't work.) I immediately reported my distress to the duty Receptionist. ( I had to walk to Reception as there was no phone in the room) who said he "would send someone". I sat in the near dark couldn't have the light on as there was the obvious hazard of water and electricity for 2 hours. Nobody came! In the end I gave up hope of any help and went to breakfast ( basic but ok) and completed a Complaints Form. Nobody has contacted me to apologise for what happened which is frankly infuriating. A simple "sorry" would suffice. I have vowed I will never darken the doors of the Queens Hotel again. It is a den of iniquity and I wouldn't even wish a night there on my worst enemy!,irish-drummer-girl
UR20699417,2008-7-October,If I had not read other reviews the night before we arrived I would have run screaming! I booked through a reputable Aussie website who claim it was 3 star most definitely was not! This hotel is extremely run down it is a maze of corridors and is easy to loose your way. I question it's safety in the event of a fire. Our room was clean and the bathroom was fairly new and clean hence the second star. Brekkie included which was good. They did not have a travel cot as requested and kept promising but it did not arrive during our 3 night stay. Claims to be all non-smoking but one very run down quad room they offered (as an alternate to the cot) was very smoky. Carpet is revolting. Swipe cards to rooms need to be 'charged' every 12 hours but ours continually did not work regardless of charging. Staff: some helpful some not... It is not good value for money and I don't think we should be saying "just because it is in London you can expect low standards for high prices" I don't think all London properties are that bad value for money!,Kazzy_Dee
UR17482841,2008-3-July,Probably the worst hotel in the U.K We booked this hotel in November for our stay in June that's 7 months! When we got there (after many hours we sailed from Cherbourg in France) in the evening we had to wait because "the rooms are being checked at this time". We waited for half an hour and then asked them to please give us the room we booked 7 months ago because we were very tired. We soon found out that the staff there barely speaks English! They gave us a key to a room and when we got there the doors wouldn't open we went downstairs two times to tell them and then they found you they forgot to put 1 in front of the room number so we had been trying to go into the wrong room for a while. We finally opened the door on the correct room and let me tell you it was the worst I have ever seen! Here's what was wrong with it : 1. Two bunk beds! We booked a standard triple room seven month ago and they give us a room with two double bunk beds! 2.There were candy wraps on the floor and a lot of big stains. 3. The oven was set on max and couldn't be turned off. 4. In the bathroom the trash was full with tampons and gross stuff like that! 5. No T.V 6. One of the two lamps there didn't work 7. It was really really small 8. No chairs to sit on 9. The desk was falling apart and didn't have all the handles. 10. What we saw out of the window was a dump! 11. You could see rusty pipes out of the wall. 12. You had to flush the toilet about 5 times each time you used it. It takes one hour to go to Oxford Circus with a bus and about half an hour to go to the first underground station in Brixton with a bus. So you will have to spend a lot of money and time to get downtown. Because it's "cheap" to stay there ( I would think it's fair to pay like 5-10 pounds for each night there I have seen hostels that were better). Many of the guests have a party and you can't sleep. The next morning we talked to the boss and he gave us another room that one also had problems but not as big as the first one. Had a twin bed and a double bunk. We stayed there from 24th of June - 1st of July I'm telling you someone should sue them! Don't make the mistakes I did and stay there please!,gittabest
UR17307070,2008-28-June,This hotel should be closed down immediately. It is unsafe due to its disgusting condition and the activity that is evident there.,srazzle922
UR18353809,2008-28-July,Wow it may be cheap but I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. When we got into the room the duvet was covered in the last occupant(s) bodily fluids. When I asked for a clean duvet cover they had none  not a single spare duvet cover! They could not solve the problem. We also had to cobble together a TV aerial in order to get reception  the front desk could not solve that problem either. The full English breakfast features yellow button mushrooms and cold beans! One of us was given an extra item  the food wrapper cooked. Dont go in the last half of the sitting as they run out of bacon but their again housekeeping will knock constantly on your door from early in the morning to harass you out of your room!,blagh
UR19465660,2008-28-August,would not stay at this hotel again / duvet cover had only what i can describe as bodily fluids on shower was so hot it would have taken skin off  and breakfast was bread cheese and ham staff very unfriendly crystal palace was a lovely place and crystal palace park near national sports centre was a real joy try the local weatherspoons for great food and staff great restaurants here to would go back to crystal palace but would not stay at the queens hotel again .should be classed as hostel and i wish i had found this site before i booked,nise28
UR18306995,2008-27-July,There are pictures of Queen Victoria around the hotel presumably to commemorate the last time it was refurbished. However it's not as bad as some reviews suggest. (What do people expect for under 50 for a double room in London?) The reception staff were slow and could take lessons from the cleaners in politeness and customer service. Although the outside of the hotel is shabby my room decoration was dowdy but okay. It was a large room with a nice big comfortable double bed. TV reception is surpringly poor given that in effect the two biggest TV masts in the country are at either end of the street. The biggest problem with the room was the aluminium sliding windows - they were stuck and didn't slide! The fact that they were stuck open was fine by me as it was a stifingly hot day and there's no air conditioning but I would have been less happy if it had been raining hard. The hotel is about 10 minutes' walk from the nearest shop and a further ten minutes from the main local attraction Crystal Palace Park and the track and field stadium. The price includes a meagre contnental breakfast but cooked breakfast is available for a small additional charge,tonyofstoney
UR13861478,2008-26-February,I'm not one to moan normally I just take it with a pince of salt but I've stayed in some bad places throughout the world but the Queens Hotel at Crstal Palace is most definately the worst it so bad I've felt the need to write a review. Given London is a vastly overpriced [--] the 'bargain' of 36 for a double room seemed quite reasonable. The reception part looks fine the rooms not so. On arrival we checked it to find a filthy room that had stains on the floor goodness knows what these stains were. There was a kettle so we were going to make a brew after a long trip down only to find the kettle was full of limescale and there was lipstick on the cups. This put us off our morning meal. The room was in need of a major refurbishment as the wallpaper which was left was falling of the walls the TV didn't work and the light fittings above our heads were dangling off. The bed linen had holes in and there were a few springs missing from our mattress. The radiator couldn't be turned off and remained on full all night. The bathroom is just a joke the taps needed turning in a vice to be turned off (you'd would have to avoid the grime that was under them first). The shower was hot though the holder was broken and also leaked through the shower curtain flooding the bathroom. Tiles were also broken. I asked for the manager at midnight though apparantly there was no manager on duty. I couldn't be arsed going any further. Generally the whole place is a shambles. We made the mistake of going cheap and not checking websites like this one before hand. Pay that little bit extra if your going to London avoid this place like the plague.,Dudleyton
UR21163071,2008-24-October,Yes - cheap it is. I should have listened to my instincts that were telling me "beware of the hotel that tries to charge yr Visa card for the entire stay before you've seen the room". Non-smoking room stank of smoke after we shut the open window. Dark mold all over the bathroom and shower hardly supplied water. You will not enjoy showering here. Girl-friend decided she preferred to stay unwashed! Toilet flush handle hanging off the wall. Sink taps needed a Schwarzenegger to operate. Bed cover underside covered in urine stains. After complaints we were given "one of the good rooms" after the first night. Fist size hole in the toilet door newer furniture and less mold. English breakfast was 5quid extra per person unless yr booking included it! And it definitely wasn't worth half of that. At the table next to us a couple started taking their food off their plates & continued eating off their paper napkins on the table! When booking on the web I found that this seemed to be the only place in the area though. On arrival we saw a nice private alternative right next door called Tower Hotel Crystal Palace. Google for the phone number! I inspected the rooms which looked fine - a bit dearer & no breakfast. 5 mins to a Cafe you'll get an excellent fry-up for 3.90.,FredFrin
UR19281314,2008-23-August,When I arrived at reception they had no record of my booking. The receptionist asked me to go through a pile of reservation print-outs to see if I could find my name on one of them - this meant that I was able to see the names of loads of other people who had made bookings - I'm sure this is illegal and at the very least inappropriate! In the end I had to log on to my emails to show them my booking confirmation. A very unusual check-in experience to say the least. The outside of the hotel looks okay and the reception area does too...but the lift hallways etc do not. I used the stairs even though my room was on the 4th floor. The room was stuffy and hot with no way of turning off the heating - on full-blast in August!! I had to have the window open fully and fan on full-blast in order to feel vaguely comfortable. The TV reception was very poor. There is a distinct lack of electrical sockets which was very annoying. The loo paper was the cheapest of the cheap and I had to go to Sainsbury's down the road to buy my own. Towels and bed linen were very worn but clean. Breakfast was a joke! I was there for 3 days and didn't bother after the first day. There is no restaurant (ie for lunch and dinner) but fortunately there are some nice restaurants and cafes near by. I wish I had read the reviews before I booked this hotel. Reading them now I am amazed that this hotel hasn't been shut down. I am glad I didn't know that the hotel is used as a homeless shelter at the time! Really wish I had gone for a Holiday Inn or some other chain... Please learn from all the people here who have made the mistake of not reading the reviews first!!,moths_are_evil
UR18114480,2008-21-July,we stayed in this hotel at the weekend and i have to say it was absolutely hideous. sadly the hotel was dirty the room was stuffy the springs in the bed were broken and the staff were far from friendly. unfortunately the only good thing about the queens hotel was leaving it this morning :(,mealyo
UR15145606,2008-19-April,we had two bookings for our family and friends from france and germany who were visiting us for the occasion of my daughters christening. this hotel experience completely ruined the event and caused us misery and extreme distress. in total we booked four rooms: one room for five nights between 10-15 april and three rooms for one night on 12th april. as a result of this hotel everyone had an awful time and noone wishes to return to the uk to visit us again. the first room was dirty and cramped. it was booked as a double room but had an extra bed crammed into the room leaving no space to move. it was unbearably hot with the radiator on full day and night which could not be adjusted. the staff told them that it was good for them to keep warm. the tv in the room did not work and silver fish insects running around on the bathroom floor which was disgusting. my friends were awoken several times a night by fire alarms and other guests who were making threatenning phonecalls in the middle of the night threatenning to beat people up. my family (six adults and one child) arrived at the hotel 10pm to be met with the night staff who casually informed us that they had no rooms for them despite us having made a booking two weeks before and us having the paperwork in our hands to prove it. initially the staff were not honest about the error and gave some story about having to check the security of their rooms before returning after 45 minutes to finally admit that they had no booking for them. for one and a half hours the night staff left them standing at reception telling them that they could not stay there because they had a booking system error and there was nothing that they could do. in the meantime they were not offering somewhere for them to even sit down or a free drink in fact no customer service gesture whatsoever and for most of the time were rude finding the situation funny and were washing their hands of the situation telling us that there was nothing that they could do. we asked for the names of the night staff who seemed to be less than fluent in the english language but they refused to give their names. during our time waiting at reception we saw numerous other guests also complaining about their rooms being substandard and unacceptable. one of these guests ended up being left to sleep on the sofa of the reception area as their room wasn"t big enough. finally when they did manage to find our rooms they were without towels and the baths were dirty. an awful experience in every respect.,galleria33
UR19043468,2008-17-August,On the night we stayed there was no electricity the toilet was faulty and there was a disgusting smell. We realised in the morning that the waste pipe outside our room had corroded and was leaking heavily. Shower and bath were also rusty. We paid for a 2 night stay. Moved out after 1 night. The hotel promised that the refund for the 2nd night would appear on our credit card statement but it didnt. Hotel now say that its too late to process a refund.

UR16947125,2008-15-June,Ok fair enough the hotel was only 40 a night but most of the issues with the hotel there is no excuse for! Checking in - the staff took about 15 minutes to check us in which was annoying after a 5 hour drive. The room etc - the corridoors to the room had the strangest smell it was very musty and made me wanna hurl... our room was still being cleaned when we turned up and our friends room had someone elses luggage in! the cleaner was polish and didnt speak/understand much english. the carpets looked like they hadnt been hoovered for a long time as they were full of dust and other peoples hairs. The bathroom was the best feature as they have all been recently fitted. Another one of our friends asked to change room as it wasnt safe - the outside window was smashed and the inside one had no lock there was also a ladder up against the window! they were given a key to a new room and this also had soeone elses stuff in it! our room had no window and the air con only blew hot air  we asked reception to help us twice eventually another foreigner walked in looked up at the air con said "broke" and walked out! so our room was like a prison cell oven! The bedding had holes in and i found 2 different types of hair in the bedding - nice! Breakfast - The whole set up was stupid we had to que up for a choice of cereal toast and craft cheese slices! Instead of having a toast machine you had ot ask a guy for toast he then had to walk into the kitchen to get it for you each time someone asked! this made it take ages to get anything. There was no cereal bows or cups left and rather than them keeping it all topped up with juice bowls etc they waited til you asked them then took ages to get anything! The toast was like warm floppy bread and the milk was warm. I wouldnt reccomend this place to anyone i would rather pay an extra 20 and stay in a nice clan Premier Travel Inn.,katy_eyres
