UR122845296,2012-9-January,The Warwick Seattle is generally shabbier than I expect from a 3.5-star hotel: the carpets on the stairs leading to the second floor are dingy and worn the lobby is tiny the furniture in my room looked dated the hotel exterior looked dated the coffeemaker in my room had some rust on the heating element. All of these things added up to a hotel that seemed as though it peaked in 1988 and has been in a state of decline since. I was also given a terrible room: on the second floor (207) with banquet staff passing by my door constantly the neon lights of the Cinerama just outside of my window and listening to buses drive by all day and night. It felt like I was sleeping in a bus terminal. When I asked for another room I was told that I would have to pay more for anything better (though the hotel hardly seemed busy). Perhaps those who stay in the executive suites have better luck but this really felt to me like a 2-star experience.,CupidandPsyche88
UR126890673,2012-29-March,So I booked a hotel room at the Warwick Hotel in Seattle Washington. I got there with my 2 boys around 8:30 at night...they offer a "late" checkin so I thought we were okay getting there at that time since I had to work that day and then drive the 2.5 hours down there from Vancouver BC. We arrived checked in went up to our room and there was ONE bed. My 2 sons are BOTH over 6 feet tall and there was NO way I was going to sleep on the couch or make one of them sleep on the couch since I reserved a room that would sleep all of us. When I went downstairs to inform them and ask for a different room they let me know that if I booked through a 3rd party (Hotwire) then they only had to give me what was left and not what I requested. Oh REEEEEEAAAALLLLLY?!?! So I ended up having to pay $40/night for a room UPGRADE because apparently THAT room (with 2 beds) wasn't "AVAILABLE". WTF. Nighttime front desk service was dismal. Daytime service was lovely. Oh...and...be prepared to spend $30 on hotel parking PER NIGHT. Public lots only charge $10 overnight and $12 daytime....so somehow the hotels (who are taking all your money in the first place) can't give guests a rate break but instead charge even MORE. Bad. Bad. Bad.,Greeneydgirl1969
UR126785165,2012-27-March,My wife and I had planned this valentine 22 year wedding anniversary night for some time we had made all the arrangement's for a great dinner room romance ect. The room was Awsome with the Space Needle so close and perfect pictures! Without getting in to details we were starting our evening and heard something outside the door. A CREEPY OLD MAN LEANING AGAINST THE DOOR LISTENING!!! this is a $300 a night room no a motel? we called down to the front desk and they said they would contact security ASAP. We heard the 2 way radio directly outside the door. THIS WAS THE SECURITY!!. needles to say we did not sleep the rest of the night. The Manager listen to my issues did not offer any support however he would look into it. We waited now over a month and still no call regarding this issue so it is important that people know of this. IT OBVIOUSLY WAS BRUSHED UNDER THE RUG. BE CAUTIOUS BEFORE STAYING HERE. The next day we seen this guy again helping with peoples cars in the garage and he just stopped and looked at us like we did something wrong????????? .,fitequipmentdoc
UR125128335,2012-24-February,Though the location was OK I would definitely not recommend this hotel. We had booked a non smoking room 4 weeks before arival and when we arrived we have been told that the only room left was a smoking room with an obscur explanation of problem with the booking agency. The desk services were poor and we had to pay extra charge to be in a non smoking room. The rooms were supposed to be recently renewed the bathroom was not. It was not very clean either. Don't go there !,Sabinis
UR126223363,2012-17-March,I stayed here because I could not access my usual hotel. The hotel's location is convenient however the first impression is not great. The hotel is dated and in need of renovating. I was in a renovated room but the attention to detail was lacking. The wall paper was peeling ceiling tiles in the bathroom were loose and the heat sensor about the shower was dangling. The service; - embarrassing. Housekeeping man compared his Blackberry to mine in the hallway and Housekeeper returns to the room with facecloths only to "scold" me for something. The entire time at the hotel the internet was unsecure and when I got home I've clearly received the spam from this connection. The only great I can say is the view.,hotel_goddess0
UR124586104,2012-14-February,This hotel is horrible! I stayed for valentines weekend one night until I could move into my time shares and it is NOTHING like the pictures it promotes. You do not get flat screens or a view. We stayed in a room that looks like its from the eighties with a twenty dollar TV! Also our view was a balcony that you cannot step out onto with a huge eight foot concrete retaining wall. I called down right after we checked in and got the "we cannot refund your money or do anything about it" response. We called everywhere we could to not sleep there and forget about our money. Another thingYou do not get free breakfast either and the hospitality was far from professional. Expedia went as far as sending us a hundred dollar voucher in exchange for the pictures we took of worn down room! don't believe the star rating I would never stay here ever again!,Nikole S
UR117682480,2011-4-September,There's a lot about this hotel I didn't like some that I didn't mind and the circumstances were not ideal. That is we didn't choose the place terribly carefully. My wife needed a certain corporate rate for a business trip she brought the family we didn't do as much research as we otherwise might for a business-plus-pleasure-bring-the-family trip. First impressions count for a lot and the Warwick really bit the big one here. I've never stayed anywhere so militant about its check in time particularly one so slack as 3:00 p.m. We flew in from the east coast and arrived at 11:30 a.m. or so. No room available. We were told to check back in two hours. We came back at 2:15 or so and had to sit until 3:01 to get our room. The front desk staff were not only unconcerned but barely masked their mild amusement at our inconvenience. The lobby was full of people in the same situation. The lobby was small and beat up and managed to look like a refugee camp for much of the time we were there. Slow elevators aggravated the conditions. After the abysmal welcome the mediocre room was rather refreshing. But the plumbing was poor. The faucets mustered barely a trickle and the tub drain was slow. The TV was a traditional 4:3 job placed rather low in a console so you can't see it well in the bed kind of hidden behind your feet. We were on the 5th floor facing a bus stop which was hugely noisy. It was as if the room acoustics were tuned to the bus engines. They start running at about 5 a.m. during the week; mercifully later on the weekend. That said. The location is excellent. Convenient to convention center Pike Place market waterfront Seattle Center and surrounded by worthy restaurants. The bar in the hotel isn't bad. An upscale market across the street gets you all you need (except fresh bread) at nearly any hour. There's a refridgerator in the room. The Cinerama across the street has a cool retro look to it and there's a view of the Space needle. The street scene is fun to watch. Beyond the few rotten apples at the front desk the bell and housekeeping staff were friendly and professional. Consistent with the late check-in time the noon check-out time is rather generous. The pool/whirlpool is fine for a quick dip and the gym looked O.K. too. We got the sense that the Warwick does a high-volume tourist business associated with the cruise ship terminals not far away. I suppose the hotel is appropriate for that market; a place to crash before embarking on a cruise or making an airport connection with perhaps a few hours to see a bit of Seattle's sights. The Warwick is definitely not a business class hotel but perhaps it's unfair to hold it to that standard. Whatever the application there are no doubt much better places to stay in Seattle. At the right price (a very low one) I would not discourage someone from staying at the Warwick. But I would not recommend it.,Aerocraft67
UR120178031,2011-4-November,Buyer beware if your a Hotwire customer and this is the hotel you get. When I checked in I was informed that the only room available was a smoking room (frankly was surprised there were smoking rooms anymore) But... for $40 more I could upgrade to a nicer room. I declined out of principle. The rooms are fine but quite noisy. I would have given this an average rating but the whole "bait and switch" thing and smelly smoking room made this a terrible experience.,Hawksurfs
UR122340242,2011-31-December,Booked two nights in this hotel mainly to get a room with Space Needle view so my Mom who is a senior citizen can see the New Year's eve fireworks comfortably inside the room. When I booked online I specified that request. When we arrived at the hotel on Dec 31st at 1pm again I made that request and I was told a room is available with a king size bed which is fine as long as it has the Space Needle view. I was ready to pay to reserve the room but the receptionist refused to take my card and told me to come back at 3 instead and the room will be ready. Came back at 5pm and another receptionist checked us in but told us the room is not available anymore they transferred us to a City View room. Why??? This receptionist told us we only booked for a deluxe room and WE NEED TO UPGRADE to get a room with Space Needle View! I would rather these people be straight with me and say they want more money rather then give me excuses!,88bee88
UR119859654,2011-29-October,We stayed here twice in 2 weeks during our honeymoon. The first time it was just for a night and the experience was average. The parking garage is small crowded and a nightmare to navigate; the attendants are not much help nor as friendly if you choose to park yourself instead of using the valet service. A week later we stayed for 4 nights and used the valet. The people at the desk are friendly enough but not very informative. The second time around we got a room on the second floor that had not been renovated. I dont mind that the stuff is outdated as long as it works. The hair dryer was not functioning the tv (big old tv) was fuzzy and did not have a remote control the shower had no water pressure and when we took out the old beat up ironing board a dirty handkerchief fell out of the closet; disgusting. If you have to stay there make sure you ask for a clean updated room. The reason I did not rate this as "terrible" is because the restaurant was GREAT (although pricy) and the front desk will mail out your post-cards for you--very convenient!,l i
UR114831903,2011-28-June,We booked our room through Hotels.com and when we arrived the hotel could not locate the booking. They would not give us another room even though they had availability and made us wait in the lobby for 45-min until they finally located the reservation. They then said they were going to move us to a smoking room and I showed them on my iphone that we had booked a non-smoking room. They said they would not guarantee room type through third parties and if we wanted a non-smoking room it would cost an additional $30 per night. We paid the "upgrade" after they advised they would not give us any other options. It was also clear that the staff had some battle going on as they were not nice with the people checking in or the people that came to the front desk for assistance. The room we received was nice however we had other options available at the price they charged. Parking was also $27 per night. There are enough hotels in the area that you do not have to stay here. All in all the trip to Spokane from Seattle was great.,jasonrt
UR122184625,2011-28-December,These people nickle and dime you. Over $50 in hidden fees. $30 parking $1.00 to make a local phone call Seattle tax hotel tax tourist fee??? $10 continental breakfeast ( which is just a dried out muffin terrible coffee and a 1/2 cup of juice.) Then to top it off the "hostess" was nothing but attitude. The couch in our room had a big hole in it the floor was all stained and we will never stay here again.,Luke C
UR115600733,2011-21-July,Reservations made one month earlier not honored. Staff aloof and inflexible. Property appears well past its prime with renovations grossly needed. Restaurant sub-par for Seattle. Best quality was the location which I rate as good but overall this is a place to avoid in my opinion.,TinyMan1
UR120797770,2011-19-November,I emailed ahead asking for early check in because I was arriving in town by 9:00 AM. They said they could not promise me a room which is to be expected. I arrived at the hotel asked if a room was available as we had our luggage and heavy bags with us. I was then told by a lady at the front desk that our type of room was not available but if we wanted to upgrade there would be a room available. I asked how much and was told $50/ night. Totally not worth it so decided to pass. She then tried to put us in a different room. She made a comment about it being for a king bed when we reserved two double beds. I corrected her and she was then arguing with me about it saying that the rate I paid was not enough for the double bed room. I pulled out my confirmation showing my reservation and she still didn't want to put me in a double bed room. The concierge said he would lock our bags in a closet which we appreciated. I had returned to retrieve something out of my suitcase and one the room they were stored in smelled horribly of natural gas two the concierge came in the room with me and proceeded to hit on me and tried to get me to go out with him that night. Not the end of the world by any means but very uncomfortable in a closed up small storage closet. The window of our room faced a cement wall. We did not receive any daylight at all as ithe cement wall blocked out all the light. The room smelled terribly of smoke whenever someone in a room around us was smoking. The smell was so overwhelming that it smelled like someone in our room as smoking. Aside from the dark and smoke smell the room was decent and comfortable. The hotel was in a good location with a short walk to each Pike's Market and the Space Needle. There was a (although quite expensive) grocery/wine store right across the street. Checkout went quick and easy.,hlovestraveling
UR113394864,2011-14-June,We arrived at the Hotel for a one night stay prior to taking a cruise. Difficult to find anything positive about this hotel. Reception run down and 'tatty' looking. Despite the presence of a concierge/porter there was no offer to help with our bags. As soon as we entered our assigned room we were amazed - and not in a positive way. The bathroom was so small that the washbasin was in the room - even the smallest cabin on the ship (144 sq ft.) managed to get this in the bathroom. The room was dirty with paint peeling off the walls and the sheets were rumpled and appeared not to have been changed since the last occupant. We immeditely booked another hotel by phone and left informing reception of our dissatisfaction. Even if we had been offered another room we would have not stayed there under any circumstances. I am not usually so negative about reviews but this was the worst place for it's star rating we have ever been in. The 'additional details/ratings' are so sketchy as th hotel was in our opinion so bad we did not actually stay there.,stuart38
UR82612182,2010-8-October,We arrived at the Warwick Hotel on September 24 2010 for a weekend stay. Staff was all very friendly and helpful but room was a tremendous disappointment. Very dated uncomfortable beds and not up to standard for cleanliness. Our "Space Needle" view room also overlooked the roof of the theatre next door and all its HVAC units - not attractive at all but Space Needle was in the distance. Worst part was the noise from the street both nights we stayed - people yelling and whistling; honking horns; etc. until after 3am both nights. It was reasonably convenient to most sites but in the middle of the monorail route - would have been better to stay on one end or the other to make travel easier. I would not stay here again.,Joni29
UR58082514,2010-8-March,My husband and I took a last minute trip to Seattle and found a low rate for the Warwick on Hotels.com. I had read mixed reviews before we left but being that it was noted as a 3 1/2 star hotel in a great location we decided to check it out. We were uncomfortable from the first moment we walked in. The lobby elevators and room were a mix of mold body odor and smoke smells. The location was not as great as we expected - most other downtown hotels (Westin Sheraton Marriott) are closer to Pike Place Market Aquarium Pier 59 Pioneer Square etc. The bathroom floor and shower tiles were cracked and the grout was covered in mold. The worst part was that there was not a mattress pad on the bed and the sheets were very thin so you felt like you were sleeping directly on an old mattress. We asked for extra sheets each night to cover the bed and give it more padding just so we could sleep. This hotel is older poorly maintained and overall disappointing. My suggestion - get a 4-star hotel on Hotwire.com in the downtown/Pike Place area. It probably won't cost much more.,Emily L
UR52898740,2010-8-January,Saw the good reviews for this hotel on tripadvisor and wanted to give it a try. Maybe my hope was too high. Positive : 1. Complimentary high internet service 2. Lobby and the bathroom on the second floor of the lobby are nice. Negative: 1. Parking is US$27/night. TWENTY SEVEN USD!!!!!!!!! 2. There's NO fan in the bathroom. So you can imagine how it smells after you do your business. Sucks!! 3. Room and bathroom are kinda old. 4. We had to move to another room since the initial room we got was VERY noisy constantly. Sirens cars you name it. 5. Beds are not so comfy kinda hard and small for 2 people.,mypreciouskids
UR82109817,2010-4-October,The girl at the front desk ignored me and kept on talking to another co-worker until another man walked into the lobby and told her to help me. She was very abrupt/rude when she finally checked me in. There were loud banging noises throughout the night that kept waking us up. I am not sure what was making the thumps.... elevator cleaning etc? In addition the outside traffic was very loud even though we were on the 5th floor. The bathroom was not clean I found brown strands of hair in the bathtub and the sink.,imzrunner
UR62635692,2010-27-April,First impression was scarred by their valet parking attendant. He was driving a car in reverse at a speed higher than necessary and almost removed the front end of our car. Further moments of not being impressed were numerous stains on the curtains and bedcovers internet access at $11 per day movies at $13.99 each cable channels were not coming in except the news parking was additional $27/day had to request housekeeping service by phone and it was already 4pm in the afternoon noise from the steet is loud at all hours due to the METRO stop right outside the window and to top it all off the food at their lounge and restaraunt is so expensive 2 of us ate for $140 with 1 bottle of cheap wine and we shared our dessert other nearby establishments were reservations recommended or 45 minute wait to eat/drink. The only good thing about the hotel was the pool was warm and the location is good for walking to attractions.,EqualOpportunity
UR72189263,2010-24-July,We hit Seattle late (5 in the evening) and tried a few places landing at the Warwick an old friend. It is simply sad. Our room was not well-kept (a beer bottle cap on the floor; grout in the bathroom was filthy; furniture and coverlet with stains); the balcony door was left open; the mattresses had long since seen better days. Given the extraordinary cost of parking ($27 plus tax) there are so many less expensive options in the area which offer as much if not more. We must say a permanent adieu to any future stays. The only plus? the charming restaurant.,arrowflight
UR76393587,2010-22-August,First off stood in line for nearly an hour JUST to check in to my room. Finally get the room key to find out on top of the over $200 / night stay I had to pay an additional $30 just to park over night in their garage! Being as it was an hour wait to get the key my husband had already been directed to park the car on level 6 with no elevator so when i got out of the line we had to walk up 7 floors empty our car and carry ALL of it down the stairs to take to our room! Even though I was told "valet" parking and luggage would be included in the price of parking. Get to our room the key did not work. Thankfully there were 2 and the other did. The room was ok. The furniture and bed was nice SMALL old tv nasty bathroom and it a constant "buzzing" sound from the water running on the floor above us. Got zero sleep. Paid nearly $300 to spend less than 10 hours in a loud dirty hotel with NO extras. No coffee in room no refridgerator in room (other than the locked mini bar fridge) No continental breakfast over all: So not worth it!,windywelch
UR71830233,2010-21-July,My wife and I had prepaid for two nights and after the first we gave up and moved out. What a dump I can not believe they had such dirty carpets and threadbare linen on the bed they even had holes in them. To be honest until they completely remodel the place I would not recommend anyone staying there. We didn't even care we had to pay again at a different hotel. Just as long as we were not staying there.,JerryH_10
UR75510460,2010-16-August,we just got back stayed in room 410 the view was a cement wall! Pool was murky hot tub was awful I know it is hard to find a place downtown but i think if you look harder you can do better The one good thing was Steve the parking attendant was helpful,doulamother
UR58639237,2010-15-March,I stay in downtown Seattle several times each year in one of several hotels which are within a few blocks of each other. So location is not a factor. This weekend we booked at the last minute and couldn't get in at any of our normal hotels so booked a night at the Warwick because the price appeared right and the reviews were good. I am not picky. I am actually quite content to stay at a decent Motel 6. However this was one of my worst lodging experiences and I have done a lot of traveling. Let me preface the review by stating that you can have a worse experience by staying at hotels/motels for half the price. I just expect that an establishment that charges for rooms starting in the mid-100s will have a few things right. OK here is what I liked: - The location was fine. It was right within a few blocks of pretty much everything downtown. - The ambience was good. It is a nice-looking older hotel. - The room was sized a bit on the smallish side but more or less as expected. - The price was good (though better value can be had downtown at other hotels). - When I booked online I was given a dollar amount with tax. This is EXACTLY what appeared on my bill. This is usually not the case. - The deal we got included parking (which can be a big deal in downtown Seattle). That's a good thing because parking there is $27 a day. Here is what I didn't like: - Check-in was rough. I had booked online through Warwick's own website but it took 15-20 minutes and a phone call to the reservations manager for them to find our reservation. Not a huge deal. I realize these things happen. - Internet access was an additional $11 per day. Frankly I would have rather them charge $11 more for the room and throw in internet access for free. Paying extra for internet access didn't sit well with me for a hotel of this sort. - The TV had about 8-10 local channels and that was all. Anything else was extra. I have seen this before but usually only in a low-end hotel/motel. - They put us on the third floor (very near the street noise) about 15 feet from the elevator and right next to an adjoining room with a screaming baby. OK I get that they were near full capacity but we couldn't have had a much worse room. - I am not a light sleeper but hardly slept all night from the street noise. The sound insulation of the windows near street-level needs to be upgraded. We found very little sound difference whether the window was opened or closed - and it is a noisy street. - Both of our beds had a strange short fitted sheet that didn't cover the whole bed. This left our feet to rest directly on the mattress. Very odd. - After finally getting to sleep housekeeping showed up very early and woke us up. - Under the light of day I found red stains here and there (on the curtain mattress etc.) At first these appeared as blood but I realized they were ink or paint. Still not pleasant to find. I have spent about 200 nights in hotels and motels and can count the experiences I consider negative on one hand. This was one of them. The hotel itself was OK. I think that the experience may largely depend on the room selection. We got a terrible room but I don't have the impression that all rooms were that bad. Still my recommendation is to stay at any of the comparably priced hotels within a few blocks of the Warwick. They are all better deals.,Stevolicious
UR87023283,2010-14-November,Sorry we stayed here. Wish we had stayed at another hotel. We would have paid more for a better one. One of the things that was upsetting was that we had a rental car which we had to pay to park at $30 per night. The rooms were old and dank. Prices at the restaurant were high and so we went out to other restaurants.,5Roses
UR67217618,2010-11-June,At 11:30am on 5-18-10 while traveling from San Francisco to Seattle on a important business trip I learned my Father was suddenly rushed to ICU in South Florida. I immediately e-mailed Warwick Hotel to let them know of my situation and that I would need my room ready ASAP once I arrive. Warwick Hotel assured me my room would be ready and even said Mr. James Harker General Manager would promptly inform all his staff. After 2pm I arrived at the Warwick & my room was Not Ready nor was any of the Warrick Staff informed. Mr. Harker was unavailable. I then told Mr. Robert Smartt Reservations Manager who was the most cold uncaring inhospitable hospitality worker I ever met of my situation. He never once expressed any concern for me while scrounging up a room. My father passed away on 5-20-10 my final day at Hotel Warwick. I let Robert Smart know that except for housekeeping to give me some privacy. That early afternoon I went to an Internet Cafe to make flight reservations back to Florida as both Warrick Hotel computers were inoperable. I got back at 4pm & my room was still never made up. The entire Warwick Hotel Staff with the exception of Dionne never expressed any condolence or sympathy towards me.,Potays
UR48830935,2009-9-November,My wife and I stayed at the Warwick Seattle the night of November 7th. The rooms are pretty nice but the walls are not good for sound proofing. In the room next door the guests there had 3 LOUD quarrels that kept us up. Apparently the police were called and at 4:15AM they finally quieted. While the hotel is not to blame for their quarrel they should at least have tried to make it up to the guests that were inconvenienced. Thinking that they would at least apologize was my thought but no such luck. When i brought it up to the desk clerk at check out she merely agreed that it was loud and sent us on our way. Terrible customer service! I will never use a Warwick again.,Avid_TravellerBc
UR31677046,2009-5-June,The front desk was just so so and didn't really seem to care. At 5 p.m. they had people waiting for their rooms and couldn't check in. The rooms seemed dirty and dingy and the pool area was dingy. It was in a great area - close to all attractions and the harbor which was nice but don't expect any help from the staff. There was a hefty parking fee in addition to a large room fee.,visitor79
UR23267761,2009-4-January,one of the worst nights ever at first our room was across from elevator and we did not want to listen to the "ding" when the door opens. we asked for another room we were given a 3rd floor corner on the street side. view of market and closed down theater. was woken by drunk and disorderly people on the street. bed was so uncomfortable must of been the original mattress from opening day. If was the worst night I think I have spent in a hotel. Staff did not care to listen to our complaint and charged us full price anyway. We traveled with another couple and they were on the 5th floor two floors above us and had the same problems.,hmeeker
UR33419378,2009-29-June,Arrived early couldn't check in room unavailable not cleaned yet. Waited past 3:20 P.M. Room still not ready. Booked room back in March. When room became available the floor was not vacuumed bathroom shower was broken and leaking. One of the double beds did not have a complete sheet on the bottom. Can't believe that they renovated back in 2006; stains on the carpets in room and hallway they must have forgotten the 3rd floor. View of the run down movie theater was our "Spectacular View" from bedroom. Front desk staff not accommodating and hospitable. I had to get one of the managers to check and see what was holding up the house keeping staff when we were trying to check in. When they cleaned the room the next day they forgot to leave clean towels. We had three adults and an infant staying and only one towel left between us. This was,Cleancat
UR35888246,2009-27-July,We simply needed a decent room to crash for a Saturday night and our only requirements were a non-smoking room and a king bed and got a decent (not smoking) rate through Hotwire. When we arrived we confirmed the latter and reiterated verbally "and that is non-smoking right?" to Ivy the receptionist. For reason I cannot fathom she ignored my statement and gave me "the last room available" which was on the smoking floor. The hotel was also full of partiers and I spotted four of them going into the adjacent room which is a recipe for disaster on top of the pervasive stale smoke. Ivy was so helpful to find us another room at another hotel we said great make this happen and she so kindly informed us "well here's the number you can call and make a reservation" -- they were not going to help us in anyway. The attitude was arrogant and indifferent. They just fell back to the fact that we were lowlife Hotwire customers and there was nothing they needed to do about it. The two minutes I spent in the room while waiting for my husband to finish parking the car (before he knew about this fiasco) I was completely unimpressed by everything but the view. Old World Charm? If you like slow elevators maybe. I thought we were due for a Langham-type experience and it was a complete let-down. Totally overhyped. One positive - location. That's it.,ImAllOverTheMap
UR35668538,2009-24-July,I reserved a room with two beds. They did not have a room with two beds despite the written confirmation. "Robert Smart" the person with whom I spoke in Seattle said there was no availability AT THE TIME I MADE THE RESERVATION. He implied it was somehow my fault because I made the reservation only 2 1/2 days in advance. He was unapologetic and argumentative. When I called the off-site reservation center -- IN BRAZIL- they too were no help. So even if you have a written confirmation for "Room type: classic double beds" it's not necessarily so.,je4son
UR32149788,2009-11-June,I was hesitant to stay at this hotel due primarily to the mixed reviews...I should have followed my instinct. The front desk was nice and pleasant enough although our room was not ready at the check-in time due to a late check-out in the room we were originally assigned to. When we finally got to check in (not the room they originally had blocked for us for obvious reasons) we found it to be nothing spectacular. There was a beautiful view of the Space Needle (which we paid additional for) however the rooms were dated and not the cleanest. The rooms were obviously well used with stains on the furniture and bedspread. The bathrooms were small and funky...a suspended ceiling in the bathroom with stained ceiling tiles...I am 5'3" and I could have easily touched the ceiling. I am in the hotel business and we have a saying...your hotel can be tired or old but this is not an excuse for dirty. We purchased our room through Expedia and honestly there were other hotels that were more upscale than the Warwick at lower prices.,DD66
UR18772572,2008-9-August,We booked this 4* hotel on the strength of the recommendations on trip advisor and boy were we disappointed! All our previous selections had been a great sucess so we thought we'd increase our budget slightly and stay here for 2 nights on our way home. We were travelling with 2 small children (5&7) so booked one room for us all. The lobby of the hotel is small and gloomy with 2 inconvenient steps down and this just about sums up the hotel. We received a lukewarm welcome at check in (early evening) and a very weak offer of help with parking and our luggage. The room itself was dark with 2 very small double beds but a view of the spaceneedle. The bathroom was dated (compared to other hotels we had just visited) a pretty pathetic shower and a hole in the ceiling. We asked at guest services for recomendations for children friendly restaurants and the staff shrugged their shoulders until a member of staff called Dave came to help us. He was the most helpful member of staff we came across our entire stay! He gave us directions & even advised us on portion sizes. The other times that we contacted front desk/guest services (very difficult to tell them apart) we were met by unhelpful & unknowledgable staff for very straightforward requests verging on the sarcastic and rude. We enquired about other breakfast restaurants whale watching tours and pottery barn locations) and we ended up doing our own research and bookings. The standard of housekeeping was not as good as it should have been - the maid didn't remove or replace dirty cups & glasses and wanted to get in our room at 8am on the day we were checking out. We only ate breakfast only once in the hotel and the waitress (a mature lady) started off by giving our children (who were sitting quitely) a lecture about behaving and being good for their parents. Slow service given a nearly empty restaurant. The hotel is located centrally and we were able to walk to places but the parking is $27 a day for guests which we thought pricey. We were also told by the front desk that internet access on our laptop was free but at checkout $11 per day had been added to our bill. When I questioned this I was told that as I had been 'miss told' they would remove it but I was made to feel pretty bad about it. Overall its a dark dated hotel let down badly by the unhelpful and rude staff. We couldn't believe all the previous excellent tripadvisor reports!,BarbadosMillie
UR14055180,2008-4-March,Stayed at the Warwick for a weeklong conference - the room was on a lower floor with a view of a parking lot (and my rate was at least $140-160) - the draftiest room I ever stayed in! A nightly wind across the floor... The neighborhood is perfect - close to everything. Room was clean and the appliances worked. I stuffed the bedspread against the window at night to lessen the draft. Disappointed that my room rate could not include something nicer or any view at all but the city was booked for the conference. (FIX those windows!). Oh and all I heard all the time was the elevator going up and down... so I didn't have a 'luxury' experience in my estimation. The biggest issue I had was that a housekeeper opened the room and left the deadbolt in the state that it held the door open. I was staying in a single came back from my conference and my ROOM WAS OPEN. Spooked me - I called down after cautiously entering. The manager didn't see fit to come up - just called me back later asking me if anything was missing. Lucky me I had forgotten to close the safe but everything including valuables was still in place. I think the manager could have managed to make an appearance in an instance like this and I have had experiences in other hotels which were less dramatic where a manager made an appearance to explain the problem. The restaurant is not good - even breakfasts were hit-or-miss (how do you screw up breakfast?) On the other hand there are wonderful eateries in the neighborhood - try another venue. The staff in the restaurant were the nicest on staff though! Oh and the prices for breakfast in Seattle are shocking - not sure why. On the east coast you can eat like a king for $15 at breakfast - here I didn't escape for under $22 and didn't necessarily feel full. I was offered a discount on my next stay after I wrote the chain. But... I cannot imagine a repeat visit to that hotel. If I return to Seattle I'll be looking for accommodations elsewhere. There are some fabulous hotels (my friends were in them and some paid no more than I). Seattle's nice people and fun atmosphere were great - if that and a place to sleep are what you're looking for this could be the place for you.,lalouisianne
UR19559619,2008-31-August,We have always enjoyed the US but sadly whilst this is a lovely Hotel it was our worst choice on any tour of the States. We arrived late and as a courtesy we readvised the hotel. Upon arrival we were just treated a 'nothings' off the street and sent to a room. Literally. We had problems with the switches in the room and were told that is the way it is. I could not recommend this hotel even for a stopover.,JohnsonFive
UR16641800,2008-3-June,The hotel is well located within the downtown core but the traffic and street noise is very loud. We were on the 7th floor and could hear people talking on the street across from the hotel. City buses just waiting at the bus stop could be heard running in the room all night long. Parking was expensive and there was no elevator in the parkade so if you have any mobility problems you need to use the valet parking.,Touring56
UR20473182,2008-29-September,North end of downtown Seattle great restaurants nearby good prices. The rooms need to be updated literally thought I was sleeping on a 1970's bed with old pillows and sheets. Net result is a bad nights sleep. I would stay their again for the location but that is it. Staff is very friendly also.,TLD2006
UR20383852,2008-25-September,As a travel agent myself I booked my group at this hotel for both the a pre-cruise stay and post-cruise stay. My room faced the Space Needle on both stays making for a great view. I have to say that this had to be the loudest noisiest hotel room I have ever stayed in anywhere. My 1st night there Sept. 12th the city was doing road work on one of the cross streets until 1pm then at 3pm drunk neighbors were yelling off their balcony to the street people partying in the parking lot below. Doesn't make for a good nights rest after flying for 4 hours and checking in at 10:30pm. If you are a light sleeper (or if you have any problems with night noise) request a back room that faces the back streets and not the space needle. The lobby is so very small so when you have a lot of rooms checking in/out at the same time then there is no room for people to even move at the counter with luggage. I find that this hotel is sold-out often so getting early check-in is hard. I found the rooms to be nothing but standard. I wouldn't consider them anything near 4-star nor the hotel for that matter. I have stayed in numerous hotels around the world from 2-star to 5-star and this one I ranked as just a room to stopover at prior to the cruise. The room was clean bathroom was clean but nothing to write home about. The one major thing that the Warwick has going for it is it's location! You can walk to Pike Place Market as well as many places to eat like MaMa's for Mexican. The bellman - Joe at the Warwick was the best employee that we encountered there. He helped us with informing us with which bus numbers to take to go down to Pioneer Sqaure (there's a free city bus that stops right outside the Warwick that goes to Pioneer Sqaure). He also set up our car service back to the airport for us without even being asked to. Just left us a voice mail in our room saying what time they would pick us up in the morning. It's cheaper to take the car service than a taxi so the hotel can arrange that for you. I did eat 1 meal at the Warwick and that was breakfast it was fine. $40 for 3 people and all I ordered was the blueberry pancakes. If time had permitted I would have walked to Pike Place Market and ate down there. Bottled water in the room is $4 so run across the street to the grocery store and buy it there it will be cheaper for you. There is no safe in the rooms and they charge I think $11 per day for internet service. Parking is $26 per day at the hotel unless you get in on one of trhe Weekend Specials. If you have a group going to Seattle we used Shuttle Express and set up a "private" city tour for 3 1/2 hours and they took us all the places we wanted to go. It was great and they picked us up right at the hotel. Got a really good rate and by having the private tour we didn't have outsiders with us so it made it a lot more fun.,cruisegaldiane
UR21161140,2008-24-October,This is a bait & switch type of place. We stayed there before our cruise to Alaska and I called from Pennsylvania to verify non-smoking. The staff would not listen when I said I refused to stay in his horrible smelly and dirty room. The lobby was also dirty and they cannot accommodate a group of people before a cruise. About 4 hours later after they sent a man with a can of spray to remove the smoke???? really a can of spray???? YES! and I refused to stay there they found a room with 8 spotlights in the ceiling no towel bars on the 2nd floor that was non-smoking. I wonder what this room is used for during other times because no other hotel room has 8 spotlights pointing to the bed???? Perhaps the police needs to know about this place that has 8 spotlights pointing to the bed???!!! We had to move our things ourselves after fighting with them for hours. And the consierge gave out bad advice about what time to leave for the ship. They said they have a smoking floor for over 20 years and there is no way they can remove the smell of smoke from a room. I said I called long distance from Pennsylvania a week before the stay and they said no problem. Don't waste your time or money by staying at the Warwickand they do nothing to help you. if you want a great place try the Doubletree Suites at Seattle WA SEATAC near the airport for a large room with great accommodations and a great staff and they have people in the lobby to print your airline boarding passes with complete gracious efficient staff for everything!,RONDA11
UR20263232,2008-22-September,I just booked our room on hotwire and was disappointed as soon as I saw the hotel. It looks old and not well kept. I called to see what type of room we would be receiving and the operator treated me like I was a homeless person begging for a room instead of a paying guest. I am absolutely sick that we are now stuck at this hotel.,msjuanita
UR22871642,2008-20-December,Well where do I start? HORRIBLE!. Okay the location was good and the restaurant was superb. Ralphs market was across the street and great as well as Dahlias restaurant. As for the hotel itself. We arrived there an hour early and were punished. Desk Clerk had something to say about our New Yawk accent. We were then punished by being given a handicap access room that had no bathtub. The room was drafty and it faced the parking lot and construction site which was noisy. The bed and the bed linens looked and felt like they were from the original days of George Washington. Shabby and nasty. The tv was antiquated the stations limited. No fridge small towels and never enough of them. Parking was almost 30 dollars a night and internet was exorbitant as well. The pool was nothing to write home about and the fitness room was .. limited as well. all in all i would say that if it were the last hotel in Seattle I would sooner camp out.,travelinggalclsg
UR22696924,2008-13-December,Part of the reason we selected the hotel was because it advertised having a pool and hot-tub. The Pool ended up being so dirty that the sides above the water were black with grime and people had taken to scratching profanities into it. Otherwise the rest of the pool had dark dirt stains covering the bottom and sides. The hot-tub was luke warm at best and just like the pool it was filthy. We informed the desk about both the pool and the hot-tub and they stated they were cleaned regularly and were operating as they should. These statements indicated to us they did not care about what we thought once they had our money. A further complaint was the difficulty in finding information related to their parking accommodations which turned out to cost an additional $27/day. The rooms themselves were adequate although the marble in the bathrooms could have used a thorough cleaning as they had dirt and rust stains. The best part about the hotel was the location as it was in walking distance of the Space Needle The Public Market and for us Qwest Field. This hotel is good if you are just looking to catch some sleep but you do not worry too much about quality. If you want to soak in the hot-tub or swim in the pool at the end of a long day look for other accommodations.,Patrick_Brock
UR15897343,2008-10-May,I attended a conference and stayed at this hotel for three miserable nights. The lobby and dining areas are fine. The rest of the hotel needs a lot of work. I had a room on the "quiet side" of the 12th floor. Unfortunately I don't think there is a quiet side of the hotel. As previous posts mentioned there was a continuous draft through the sliding glass door since it wouldn't close all the way. I asked to move to another room and was told that all the nonsmoking rooms were booked. The room was so loud from buses and other traffic noise that it sounded like a freight train was going to come through the wall at any time. I've stayed at a lot of hotels on business trips and this was by far the noisiest. The towels and sheets were threadbare. The heater roared loudly and the room was either hot from the heater or cold from the draft. The conference facilities were drafty and the food was average. The front desk staff had a pleasant appearance but did not seem interested in providing any assistance with dining recommendations transportation directions etc. I asked the bellman for directions to a restaurant and he sent me down the wrong street. This is not a hotel I can recommend for any type of group.,RoadTripsRUS
UR7483431,2007-30-April,We stayed three nights had a double room on the 7th floor. Upon check in the staff was not really welcoming. Bed linens are low quality torn blankets thin and worn flat sheet thrown over a thin felt like pad on bottom mattress. We were there Thursday through Sunday by the time we left Sunday our trash container was stacked about 2 feet tall with trash that had not been removed from the room since the first day (newspapers pizza boxes plastic bags paper cups). I kept pulling it further into the room each day thinking they couldn't possibly miss it again. They did. Even though the hotel went through a renovation not too long ago the rooms are pretty dated. Parking was expensive $21 per day plus wifi at $9 per day. with sales tax over 15% added on it was not an inexpensive hotel. I remember seeing it rated as 4 star. I'd probably say more like 2.5 star. Parking for guests is on levels 4 and above. Yet there is no elevator in the garage. Location of the hotel is very good and although we did not try them the bar/restaurant seemed pretty busy. Bottom line....we were not impressed with either the service or the hotel itself and will definitely stay elsewhere next time we are in Seattle.,shellyandnat
UR7275823,2007-3-April,Stayed here for two nights as part of a tour package. The location is great and the hotel has a good restaurant. However some of the staff seemed to be haughty. The pillows were hard and lumpy bedding needs to be replaced. The room was stuffy as the ventilation fan switches off whenever the room temperture approached the temperture set on the thermostat. There was no way to override this feature.,JWBlack
UR10374856,2007-27-October,I was pleasantly surprised that I was given a room with a king-size bed so I was off to a good start but that soon ended. The bed sheets were old and felt like they were poorly washed. The room had a very poor shower that trickled out water. Plus they had rigged some type of showerhead using a bath faucet. The drain was slow and you waded around in the shower water even with the poor water flow from the shower. One side of the room is all window with a patio window...not much of a view. So with the window also came all the city noise. Unfortunately the fan settings for the room were either "Off" or "Automatic" so it did not help to drown out the city and hotel noise. It was slightly cool outside and the cold air just poured in from the bottom seal of the patio window. The hotel does have a good selection of local beers and wines. The food was okay but very over priced as you will find throughout the downtown area. The best meal I had was at the Seattle Tap Room in the airport. Beware if you use the Grayline for transportation allow plenty of time as they ran up to an hour late.,Drew_in_Alamo
UR7477677,2007-27-April,I'm not a terribly critical person but I really hated this hotel. It has some good points - for example it's cheaper than other options in downtown Seattle and it's in a decent location. (It's not in the center of downtown like the other hotels but it's only a 5 or 6 block walk). However those are the only positives. The rooms are very dark and the furniture is really old and mismatched. This gives the impression of it being dirty as soon a you walk in. As far as cleanliness it was just okay - it's the kind of place that makes you feel as though you need to check the sheets before crawling into bed. The blankets were really really worn but the sheets seemed clean. Everything else was a crap shoot. My biggest problem with the room was that it was freezing. They have these "balconies" which are not meant for actually standing on which were very drafty and made the room unbearably cold. I turned up the thermostat but it didn't help. And when it actually kicked on  the smell that came out of the vent was disgusting. It smelled like mold and mildew. We actually turned off the heat and froze just so we wouldn't be subjected to the smell. Anyway...I thought this hotel would be okay since I was not planning on being in it very often and I really just needed a convenient location to sleep. Now that I've stayed there I realize it would have been just as cost effective to spend a little more and stay somewhere that provided some comfort. The Warwick charges $23 (I think) for parking and $12 for internet /per day. By the time you add all the extras I could've stayed at the Red Lion or Hotel Monaco for only slightly more. If you're going to Seattle look hard at spending a little extra for another hotel - and you'll probably even end up right in the center of downtown.,alizarine
UR11076894,2007-26-November,My mother and I stayed at the Warwick for 2 nights in November. The hotel itself was ok fairly clean and decent location.The front desk staff however are not helpful and pass the buck so as not to have to deal with a problem. If they are working on improving customer service  as previous reviews have stated they have a ways to go.,justmyopinion_7
UR10830238,2007-15-November,after booking thru expedia i read some reviews and was concerned about the Warwick. I was wondering what i was getting myself into. The hotel is older but i found it clean. Front staff are really trying to improve their customer service. Errors upon checkin. They gave me a single bed when i asked for seperate queen beds. They told me no rooms available. They offered to bring an extra cot. When i was settling into room front staff said they located a two queen room and so i was moved. Package was to include free parking but i was charged for valet parking which i'm in dispute with the Warwick about. I'lll see what they do about it. Would i stay again? Hard to say. Room was quiet and clean. Nothing spectacular. I'd give it a better rating if there wasn't so many errors with the bill and checkin but they seem to be trying and sometimes that's all you can ask for.,thailandisles
UR10071888,2007-12-October,We stayed at the Warwick for a night in October. Our original room reeked of smoke and so we were downgraded (they said that at the front desk) to the 6th floor. Our room was small and poorly furnished and stocked (no microwave fridge etc.). They charged us more than the quoted price but the confirmation email I received only contained the confirmation # not the price so we have been fighting this for 7 days now. To top it all off we were charged for 2 nights! $487.51 total--it is not worth the money at ALL. We've been calling the hotel nightly and every employee we speak to is unable to fix the problem; we've been getting passed from manager to manager and department to department and we have to repeat our story and prove ourselves over and over again despite being promised that it will "be fixed immediately--I promise." This is by far the worst customer service experiences we've EVER had.,Pitter7378
UR10065014,2007-10-October,I was in Seattle for my best friends wedding and she had reserved a block of rooms at this hotel. My husband and I checked in Friday night along with another couple intending to stay two nights. When we checked in we were told that our room would be a different price than what we were quoted. I questioned the woman checking us in and she said we needed to have the confirmation number. I printed off the confirmation number and showed it to her. She then told me that the confirmation number was not enough and that I needed to have the price I was quoted in writing. I did not have time to deal with that right away ( I had to get ready for the rehearsal and grooms dinner.) So we ran up to our room to get ready. When I opened my hotel room door the smell of smoke was overpowering. I immediately returned to the front desk because I had definately not booked a smoking room. The woman at the desk told me that my room was not a smoking room but the floor underneath my room was smoking and it must have drifted up. !?! I asked her what she could do for me and quickly because I needed to get ready and go. After she debated with a couple other employees I was told I could wait 40 minutes while they cleaned it or check into a room on the 6th floor (no view) which was a downgrade from my 15th floor with a view. I had no other choice than to take the downgrade. I asked to speak with a manager no one was available. I asked to speak with the person that I had originally booked my room with. I was told I could call the front desk and asked to be connected to her if she was in. We stayed the night in the 6th floor room and the fan in the bathroom was broken! The next day I reported the broken fan and again asked to speak with a manager. I was told the manager on duty was on lunch breakbut I could leave my cell phone number and they would call me. I never recieved a call. We all checked out after the one night telling the person at the desk that we were extremely dissatisfied. The staff seemed very uncaring. I asked for directions to the Marriot by the water they could not give me directions. I asked them to look it up on mapquest for me they couldn't do that either. I just looked at my bank statement and realized they have charged me for 2 nights! I will have to call and figure this out now. This hotel is a joke and it is not even nicely decorated. It seems run down and old. The bride had the suite on the top floor and even that room wasn't amazing. The furniture was marble but chipped and looked out dated. I would never stay at a Warwick again!,teddybear78
UR6724660,2007-1-February,The Warwick is located in Belltown an interesting neighborhood with some fabulous restaurants. It has a nice lobby and the rooms were pretty clean. The front desk however was a horror show. We had asked for a pot of coffee to be delivered at 6am every morning as we needed to be up and out by 7. On the third morning we did not get our coffee and consequently arose an hour late. And in Seattle of all places! On two separate occasions we asked for the so-called complimentary transportation. Upon the first request we were told we would have to wait at least a half hour and that we should take a taxi. The second time we asked for transportation we were told our destination was "too far away". The point is - don't advertise the service if there are caveats that go with it. The front desk staff was aloof and not interested in reparing the harm and for that reason alone I would not stay there again. But I do intend to return to Seattle - great town!,Bevi525
UR6352917,2006-9-December,This hotel completed extensive renovations in 2006 and the rooms are lovely. Although the rooms are modern the hotel has the feel of a traditional hotel. The staff are all well dressed and well mannered and very professional. The location is convenient and there is a small gourmet supermarket across the street open until 1AM. As other reviewers have mentioned however street noise is a factor to be considered. The hotel has floor-to-ceiling single glazed windows and even on the 8th floor trucks and buses could be heard at all hours of the day. Seattle is a very hilly city which adds to the vehicular noise. Most importantly if you are planning to use the wi-fi internet access BEWARE. It's about $10 per day but the signal strength is super weak and inconsistent. I had to stand next to my room door to get a halfway decent signal - at the desk there was almost no signal. Hotel staff acknowledge this and have a LAN conversion kit which didn't work either. Bottom line if internet access is a factor stay elsewhere.,1NicePerson
UR6006603,2006-24-October,My sister and I stayed in a two double bed room on the third floor (305) We requested a room on a higher floor but none were available upon check-in. I've read reviews you can hear street noise on the lower floors. The room was very noisy and I couldn't get any sleep. If you're a light sleeper go with a higher floor if you can get one. Room was nice (at time of walk in) but small. Bathroom was small as well and didn't have enough towels for two people. When we closed the curtains I noticed several stains. They were dark reddish brown in color. I'm assuming they were blood stains. I was disgusted. The phone's earpiece was visibly dirty and there was a hair in the bathtub before we used it. I left my comments about the room with management and haven't heard back. Location was great close to shopping and the market. Parking was $21 a night but a good deal since other lots are pricier and street parking is scarce. Check out is at noon and parking was good until 5pm. There is a grocery store across the street and a starbucks and seattle's best coffee 2 -3 blocks up on Lenora. We had breakfast at the hotel restaurant. Food was good and service was great! Seattle Times paper was delivered every morning. Internet service is not included in the price of the room and cost $10 a day. If you're looking for restaurants in the area try The Icon Grill on 5th and Virginia and the Pink Door at Post Alley 1st and Stewart.,travelin75
UR5818243,2006-20-September,Stayed here for 2 nights last week. Had a confirmed reservation via hotel website (with a printout in my hand) but the front desk says the room is not available. Waited for about 20 minutes and a room became available although not the type I reserved. My rate included continental breakfast but had to tell the front desk again who finally gave me the vouchers. My room was on the 16th floor facing the Space Needle. You can hear a lot of noise from the street until late night. Overall I would not recommend this hotel.,bijou2006
UR5809175,2006-17-September,We had a post stay at the Warwick after an Alaskan Cruise. We stayed pre-cruise at a different establishment. Checkin is at 3pm. we arrived earlier and they were happy to store our luggage and told us we should have rooms ready by 11:30 or 12:00. They were. We however were given wheelchair accessable rooms so I can't comment on the regular accomodations. The rooms are average size and comfortable although the bed frame sticks out a bit on the ends leading to stubbed toes if you get too close. The bed was comforatble and the room contained all the ammenities you would expect. TV alarm clock coffee maker mini-bar. There are small balconies with sliding doors. The decor is typical of a high rise hotel but the leather headboard makes a statement. Ice machines are available on four floors only. The pool and gym are located in the basement. THe pool is small and 3 feet deep but very nice. The hot tub was broken so I cannot comment on it. The gym is well stocked with equipment and towels. There is also a two person sauna available. The mens room has lockers and showers for changing. Although I went to turn on the shower and the fixture fell off. I was blasted back into the wall by a stream of hot water. The bathroom was set up with a handicap shower no tub and a hand spray fixture which had very little water pressure. The hotel is VERY convenient to shopping and walking around. There is a shuttle to the airport for 10.25 per person that leaves every :25 and :55 on the hour. It takes about 25 minutes to get to the airport and is very comfortable. I did notice the staff recommending the private car service to the airport for $35.00 but this is about the same if not more than taking a cab especially after tipping the driver. I leave that to personal opinion. Would I stay here again.....Most likely not. Although the staff was friendly and the restaurant good the hotel lacked the comfort and personality factor that I look for when I travel.,bububr
UR6128053,2006-14-November,The Warwick Hotel has a great location in Seattle. Close to shopping PIke Place and the Seattle Centre. However what really lets this hotel down is it cleanliness. The bed linen was torn bottom of curtains were torn and the floor had a few stains. The hotel advertises itself as having a balcony which in reality is a disappointment. We stayed in a hotel in San Diego which did have a balcony - table chairs etc. The Warwick balcony is about 10 inches.The view from rooms with a view of the Space Needle is terrific but doesn't make up for the poor cleanliness. The check in staff were neither pleasant nor unpleasant and we decided not to sample the restaurant. Ralph's deli across the street is great for snacks and also has a cafe.There are plenty other better hotels in Seattle for the same or slightly more money than the Warwick - choose one of them e.g The Hotel Andra.,5634
UR3605654,2005-23-June,I booked this hotel through Hot Wire and called immediately requesting a nonsmoking room a king bed and a room away from the elevator/ice. The person I spoke to was pleasant and stated they could not guarantee these requests would be honored but would make a note on the reservation. At check-in the person at the desk was very rude said there were no special request noted on our reservation card and stated there were no king beds and because of the way the reservation was made we were stuck with 2 double beds. We were located directly accross from the elevator and ice! It was nonsmoking. There is no elevator from the parking garage to the hotel. The "Warwick" mats in the garage are filthy as are the stairwells. The part of the hotel that faces 4th smells of urine. The carpets in the registration and elevator area need cleaning. The upholstery and curtains in our room needed cleaning and pressing There was a sign in the bathroom about water conservation; however the tub facet dripped continuously. The tub drain needs attention the shower curtain has holes in it. There was no coffee maker in the room. The bedding did not fit the bed and we found ourselves sleeping directly on the mattress with bedding askew. Other staff were also unfriendly and short. The housekeeping staff was quite pleasant. I will NEVER stay at this hotel!,discriminateWA
UR2818540,2004-11-November,Well for those who read trip advisor reviews I hope you will pay close attention to this one. We stayed recently at the Warwick Seattle for a few nights before continuing our Pacific Northwest journey to British Columbia. We booked through Clipper Vacations the price was right and we were told we would really like this hotel. From the moment we walked in there was a definite charm to it; cozy older lobby with a fireplace 4 clocks from different major cities (I like this feature) and a concierge desk. At the front desk we were greated by a very cold and young front desk agent . No formal greeting no nothing but a straight and matronly face (we were surprised as she must have been under 20). We asked her not to put us near the elevator in a room number ending in a 6. (We read this on trip advisor). She put us in roon number ending in 8. We went up to the room and this room was right next to the elevator. I immediately marched back down and asked her to switch the room. (she did without any apology) She moved us 4 doors down. We were in the room for an hour or 2. We noticed it was very cold in the room and we tried to adjust the heat it did not work. We called and immediately they came up to try to fix. It was redeemed broken. So we then moved to another 4 flights up. We were in this room 10 minutes and they called to say they wanted to move us again as there was going to be alot of kids coming in for a wedding and they would be on this floor so then we moved to another floor ( 4 different rooms). We asked if they could upgrade us to a larger room  they said no because we were on a package rate. I thought this was wrong as were inconvenienced. I was too tired to argue at this point. THE ROOM: the really need to redo standard rooms. The carpet is a checked brown and white reminded me of an old holiday inn. The lights are very very dim I guess to save money. The hotel is not in the greatest area and beware of seedy people around there. Brasserie Margaux was terrific and the grocery street across the street (ralph's) is great. I do not think I would stay at the Warwick again.,A TripAdvisor Member
